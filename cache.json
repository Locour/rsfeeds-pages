          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

There are many more, for the same or different reasons.\nUber, a cab dispatch service, also uses Node.js for their core system. \nNode.js was chosen because the Uber service is used all over the world and requires a huge network system to operate.\nPaypal is a payment service that uses email accounts and the Internet.\nBy switching from Java to Node.js as the server-side development language, the gap with the front-side development has been reduced.\nLinkedIn is the social network for professional connections. It is best suited for people looking to make serious career moves who want to get noticed by relevant companies. \nPreviously, Ruby on Rails was used, but in order to increase the speed of access, it was moved to Node.js.\nNetflix is the world’s biggest global provider of video streaming including movies and television series, available in over 190 countries. As of July 2020, Netflix reported over 192 million subscribers worldwide, with more than 72 million in the U.S itself.\nPreviously, Netflix was using Java on the back end and JavaScript on the front end, which required the developers to be proficient with languages.\nNow, The user interface (UI) of Netflix was built using Node.js.\nNext, his is an explanation of the Node.js package management tool \"npm\".\nnpm is automatically installed when Node.js is installed.\nThere are two ways to install packages with npm \"global installation\" and \"local installation\".\nnpm allows to create a file called \"package.json\".\nThese are useful command of npm.\nnpm install npm \nnpm i npm \n\nnpm install [package name] \nnpm i [package name] \n\nnpm uninstall [package name] \nnpm rm [package name] \n\nnpm update [package name] \nnpm up [package name] \n\nnpm list \nnpm ls \n\nnpm init\n\nToday, I explained about basic Node.js.\nI hope this article helps you understand node.js!\nHappy coding! :)",

Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node.js, wanted to create real-time websites with push capability. On Nov 8, 2009, Node.js was first demonstrated by Dahl at the inaugural European JSconf. Node.js has now become a critical component in the technology stack of large-scale enterprises. But like any technology, it has its own set of limitations.\nNode.js is a dynamically typed single-threaded programming language. There is a lot of freedom for the interpreter and runtime to make decisions that can easily lead to memory leaks and high CPU loads. This can lead to performance issues, loss of resources, and potential downtime. Hence, it is crucial to monitor your No…",

          "description": "MERN Stack happens to be amongst the well-known JavaScript stacks intended for enhancing the web app development process. It is a combo of 4 components: MongoDB, ReactJS, Expressjs, and Nodejs.\nBelow we will take a close look at each of these components in brief.\nMongoDB\nMongoDB is a NoSQL database that is document-oriented. As compared to the relational database, it will not come across any column or table. It stores information with an extremely flexible document by making use of JSON-based query language. The time and the productivity needed for fetching the formation are much better than the RDBMS (Relational Database Management System).\nExpressJS\nBeing a framework for Node JS, Express JS is used for developing API and web apps with minimalized structure and outstanding speed. It removes the burden of writing the identical code again and again for the server, unlike the Node JS HTTP module.\nReact JS\nThis one happens to be a JavaScript library that Facebook has developed for creating UI of the webpages. Being declarative React views help to make the process of interface development much productive. It will be possible to run the same code on the server and the browser simultaneously by using React.\nNode JS\nNode JS is open-sourced by Google and is created on Google Chrome. It is built on the JavaScript engine of Chrome. It has been designed for creating network applications that are scalable and also executing JavaScript code outside a browser. Node JS works excellently when enclosed with an HTML page rather than making use of its module.\nLet's know here 4 compontents features, pros & cons with Why use them: https://www.launchora.com/story/mern-stack-development-best-fit-for-web-developm",

It does so by generating many inputs to be executed until on of them crashes the target program. In other words the objective is to crash a program, but how can we guide the fuzzer in the right direction? \nAFL added to the objective a notion of code coverage: Any input that reaches an area in the code that was unreachable before is interesting. Even if it did not crash the program we can mutate that input to get even more coverage, we call this feedback.

Entering the /404 route will do the job as well.\nIn production, however, the 404 page doesn't get handled by itself unless you use a dedicated hosting service for Gatsby pages. That's because Gatsby's development server is no longer present. The production bundle is just a bunch of static files. Making use of a web server (like nginx) to serve the production page forces you to configure the error pages yourself.\nDisclaimer: the following nginx configuration is pretty basic, don't use it in production.\nLet's assume your blog is hosted on the personalblog.com domain and is served from the /var/www/blog directory on port 80.\nserver {\n        listen 80;\n        root /var/www/blog;\n        server_name personalblog.com www.personalblog.com;\n        location / {\n                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;\n        }\n}\n\nAfter entering a route that doesn't exist in your production Gatsby site, nginx displays its default 404 error page.\n\nAdding the error_page 404 /404; line makes nginx redirect to the /404 route in case of a 404 error. Your custom Gatsby 404 page will be displayed.\nserver {\n        listen 80;\n        root /var/www/blog;\n        server_name personalblog.com www.personalblog.com;\n        error_page 404 /404;\n        location / {\n                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;\n        }\n}\n\nVisit the error_page docs section to explore the rest of the configuration options.",

Once instrumented, we will dive deeper into the capabilities of Application Insights and show how to leverage all the rich data collected from our application. Finally, as developers the last thing we want to do is troubleshoot an issue in Production, with everyone watching and the stakes are high.\nWatch as we monitor a live application that is throwing exceptions and how Application Insights can be used to help us solve the problem faster.

It works fine on Raspberry Pi, Odroids and Intel servers.\nThe unixorn/cupsd image is a bit on the large side because I crammed a lot of printer drivers into it, you may want to look for docker images that only support single printer families.\nWe're going to store printers.conf in a directory outside the container so that we don't lose our printer configuration every time we upgrade our container.\nI run the cupsd server on an Odroid HC2 because I have /var/lib/docker on the 2TB drive attached to it. I could have put it on one of the Raspberry Pis in my cluster, but didn't want it spooling print jobs and causing excessive wear on a rPi's microSD card.\nMake a directory to store your printer configuration.

          "description": "If you're working with NodeJS applications, you probably has process.env.VARIABLE statements all around your code base. The most simple method to configure an application is installing dotenv and creating that lovely .env file on the root folder of your project.\nThis approach, however, has some pitfalls and is error prone. What if you don't set that process.env port? You'll probably have a default value (maybe 3000?), but you will need to run your application to discover such type of thing.\nThat same problem has been solved by typescript for almost anything. When you have the help of static typing, you can discover some errors a lot faster. That said, how can you use Typescript to have a type-safe way to access configurations?\nTake a look at that short snippet:\nexport class EnvironmentService<Environment> {\n\n  public constructor(\n   private readonly variables: Environment\n  ) {\n    // some logic to assign process.env to this.variables\n    // you can use, for instance, \n    this.variables = Joi.attempt<Environment>(process.env))\n  }\n\n  public get<T>(name: keyof Environment) {\n    return <T><unknown>this.variables[name];\n  }\n}\n\nIn a nutshell,\nFirst, you need to define an interface for you environment;\nThen, you do pass it as a type parameter to the EnvironmentService class when instantiating a new object;\nFinally, use something like class-validator, Joi or you library of choice to assert if the process.env object has all required variables and assign its value to the variables attribute;\nAfter those simple steps, you can use the method get to fetch all possible environment variables with the help of typescript to guide your choice - and if you need, you can cast the value to some desired type:\n\nThat's all folks! If you liked that simple content, don't forget to comment and share with someone you might help. Also, that's my first attempt to write something in english: if you see something wrong, just message me on Twitter (@dotmendes\n).\nTypescript Handbook: Keyof",
