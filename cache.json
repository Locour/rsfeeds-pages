          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

Here we’ll see the reasons of why you should choose Node.js for server side programming. But before digging to it, let us see the overview of Node.js.\nNode.js is an application runtime environment that allows you to write server-side apps built on Chrome’s V8 Javascript engine. It uses event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that make sit lightweight and efficient. And it’s ability to use Javascript on both frontend and backend adds one more benefit for development.

Especially given SaaS spending is expected to increase an additional 36% between 2020 and 2022. \nA SOC 2 certification from the AICPA is a foundational step that will help every service provider reduce security risks. Below is a guide to SOC 2 compliance requirements and certification.\nSOC 2 is an independent audit report that evaluates the security controls a tech service business uses to protect the data they process in the cloud. Possession of a SOC 2 report is considered table stakes in the SaaS industry, as the answers to most security questions a customer may have about their business’s security posture can usually be pulled from this report.\n“SOC” stands for “System and Organization Controls” and was created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). SOC 2 is one of three SOC reports, each with different purposes and/or levels of transparency:\nSOC 1. Used to audit internal controls relevant to a customer’s financial systems. Report usage is “restricted,” meaning its use is limited to auditors, the service organization, and authorized users.\nSOC 2. Used to audit the overall management of customer data.

The engineers thought out the agent, collector interface pretty good. \nThe Traces specification and the TraceID stuff is good too, I just hope there was more sync between the published package and the github repository.\nNeed to show the instrumentation demo to the lead.\nProbably will need to checkout Elastic APM exporters for these traces.\nSee if sentry can support any logging :)\nChecking how opentelemetry trace back the traces by the ID.\nWTF is going on with those spans?

Scout APM provides developers and application administrators software performance insights by delivering key web application performance metrics. \nTraditionally an APM tool, Scout has expanded its service offerings to now include error monitoring of web applications for more cohesive and actionable observability insights within a single platform. This new feature supports an overall better user experience by eliminating the need for multiple web-application monitoring services; Scout APM with Scout Error Monitoring offers performance and error insight and alerting within a single, integrated dashboard.\n“Scout’s industry-leading performance and, now, error monitoring solutions are essential for developers building performant, cloud-native applications,” says Jason Hable, Scout’s CEO. “We wanted to expand our services to build a more holistic performance and exception monitoring tool to help our customers solve issues quickly and efficiently. By connecting error reporting and performance monitoring data in one platform we provide our customers with the insights they need without paying for the features they don’t.”\nMultiple trends and factors have contributed to the growth of both the APM and error monitoring markets in recent years. Companies are experiencing an increased reliance on advanced data analytics and automation as cloud computing and containers become progressively mission-critical. \nAbout Scout APM\nScoutAPM.com.",

Also, we will show you a simple solution to recover any data lost from an LV RAID 5 system as a result of accidental removal or unexpected drive failure.\n\nLVM RAID is a method to create a logical volume (LV) which uses several physical disks to improve performance or fault tolerance. Within LVM, physical disks (abbreviated as PV, physical volumes) belong to one volume group (VG).\nAlthough it is much safer to use MD RAID, if you really need to migrate from conventional disks to a RAID system without having to change their file systems, this method can be very useful.\nAllocating information with blocks of logical volume data on physical disks is determined by a specific RAID type.

These range from gamification of business applications to data-driven user experiences. Two interesting applications of the latter topic include dynamic routing through an application and dynamic component layout. Both are examples of user experiences that vary based on factors such as user role and prior uses of the application.

          "description": "Hi, I was recently doing a project for my portfolio, a React Project with a slightly complex state. Personally, I really love TypeScript and the Redux/Reducer patterns, because they give me a great Developer Experience with TypeScript and a lot of autocompletion available, quite useful in order to not get bit by a bug caused by a typo, and really convenient as I don't have to explore files constantly in order to know what are the properties that a certain object should have.\nI always prefer to use TS over vanilla JS, so, it makes a lot of sense to try to make use of strict typing, even in a concept app. Also, while vanilla useReducer might not be what most projects use, I still want to share how I found it to be pretty useful in this context.\nMy application is a Social Media-like platform,…",

Many libraries have emerged to answer specific needs, and it can be a little bit overwhelming at first: which one to choose? what strategy to adopt? \nEven without using a library, just using pure React, you can basically go two ways: controlled or uncontrolled. We will briefly discuss this, so if you're new to React, you might want to start there. \nIf you already know all about controlled VS uncontrolled forms, you can skip the first part and jump right to the second one, where I will show you how I like to build my forms today: using react-hook-form, yup and TypeScript. Those tools allow me to quickly build any type of form w…",

          "description": "Sometimes when writing an app in React you might have a component that changes its look and logic dramatically depending on provided props. In addition, if a particular prop provided, the other props become either required or restricted. That hidden prop relation can be explained in documentation but if your project uses Typescript there is a great opportunity to utilize what I call \"sets of props\".\nIt's usually not the best idea to make buttons look like links and vice versa but let's ignore this for the sake of clarity. The code snippet below is so-called Clickable component which can be either a link or a button that shares the same style but has different behavior depending on props.\nimport { ReactNode } from 'react'\n\ninterface BaseProps {\n  children: ReactNode\n}\n\ninterface AsButtonProps extends BaseProps {\n  as: 'button'\n  onClick: () => void\n  href?: never\n}\n\ninterface AsLinkProps extends BaseProps {\n  as: 'a'\n  href: string\n  onClick?: never\n}\n\ntype ClickableProps = AsButtonProps | AsLinkProps\n\nconst Clickable = ({ children, as, onClick, href }: ClickableProps) => {\n  return (\n    <>\n      {as === 'a' && (\n        <a href={href}>{children}</a>\n      )}\n\n      {as === 'button' && (\n        <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>\n      )}\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Clickable\n\nThe component has four props. children is required in any case so it's put under the BaseProps interface. Both AsButtonProps and AsLinkProps extended from BaseProps and represent two sets of props. The active set depends on the value of the as prop while the type never for unused props makes sure that Typescript will yell if someone is using a prop which does nothing.\nHere is a scheme:\n\nThis pattern is obviously not limited to props in React. It's widely used in the types of various npm packages. Now you can add it to your arsenal and build reusable components/utils with better API for you and your team.\nTypeScript Deep Dive: Never Type\nSyntaxFM: Episode 348.

These range from gamification of business applications to data-driven user experiences. Two interesting applications of the latter topic include dynamic routing through an application and dynamic component layout. Both are examples of user experiences that vary based on factors such as user role and prior uses of the application. In other words, two different users may be presented with an entirely different experience based on both a priori knowledge of the user and how the user interacts with the application in real tim…",

Over the last few months though I got the opportunity to learn Rust.\nRust in my opinion is very much like typescript on steroids. While Typescript may enforce types in your code if you happen to pass a string to a type expecting a number things will still compile and may even work as expected still. With Rust this is not the case. If you provide an unexpected type either things will not compile in the first place or your software will crash. \nA personal project of mine (Cryptotithe) which is an open source tax software for cryptocurrencies was something I always though would benefit from WA…",

You are trying to follow best practices, like using strict mode. And don’t want to use any and unsafe casts. so you start adding types:\ntype SomeType = {\n  tags: (string | number)[];\n  packages: string[];\n};\nconst someObj: SomeType = { tags: [], packages: [] };\n\nThis was easy, but then you hit one issue that you can’t really write type for hasValue without using some sort of casting. This is your best attempt:\nfunction hasValue<K extends keyof SomeType>(key: K, item: SomeType[K]) {\n  return someObj[key].indexOf(item) !== -1;\n  //                   ^^^^\n  // Argument of type 'Som…",

          "description": "Query Keys are a very important core concept in React Query. They are necessary so that the library can internally cache your data correctly and refetch automatically when a dependency to your query changes. Lastly, it will allow you to interact with the Query Cache manually when needed, for example when updating data after a mutation or when you need to manually invalidate some queries.\nLet's quickly have a look what these three points mean before I'll show you how I personally organize Query Keys to be able to do these things most effectively.\nInternally, the Query Cache is just a JavaScript object, where the keys are serialized Query Keys and the values are your Query Data plus meta information.
