          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

By doing this, I inherit a set of robust properties without having to write too much new code.\nLet’s start with the User model:\n\nIn my ToonSpace project, I create a model named “ToonUser” and add some custom properties that IdentityUser doesn’t already cover, including:\nFirstName\nLastName\nDisplayName\nFullName\nImageData\nContentType\n\nI also inherit the properties of IdentityUser by using the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity namespace and inheriting from Identity user when I name the class:\n\nWhat properties does IdentityUser grant me access to? A lot.\n\nWith these properties appended to my ToonUser, I have the tools I need to allow users to register accounts and interact with my application.\nIn my data folder, I access my ApplicationDbContext file and inherit IdentityDbContext of type ToonUser.\n\nThen I add the ToonUser to my Identity service, along with Default UI and DefaultTokenProviders.\n\nNow I’m ready to scaffold Identity pages for user accounts. I add a Scaffolded Item in my Areas > Identity folder and select “Identity.” \n\nI override all files and select ApplicationDbContext as my data context class. Once I add the scaffolded Identity pages, my Identity folder will be filled with boilerplate razor pages.\n\nI access the code behind for the “register” view and add properties for First Name and Last Name because those properties are not the default with Identity pages. I also add fields to the View for the user to enter this information.\n\nNow that I have registration pages scaffolded and augmented to fit my ToonUser model, users can register an account on my application.\nI hope these letters find you well, dearest Coder.\nUntil next time, godspeed in your keystrokes.\nClickity Clacks,\nKasey",

For example, a person's face or fingerprints are unique to them and can be measured. So they're often used to identify a person in law enforcement applications.\nBiometrics have been used for identity verification since 1883 when French criminologist Alphonse Bertillon first used body measurements to identify repeat offenders. Today, biometric authentication is growing in popularity for enterprises because biometrics are an effective way to control access to sensitive information, devices, or physical locations.\nHowever, biometrics aren't impenetrable and come with increased privacy risks. So any organization seeking to utilize biometrics to verify employees or end users should pay close attention to how they implement biometric identification systems.\nBelow is what executives need to know about using biometrics for their organization.\n\nRead more...",

Feel free to click on that Billgist template to go through it. \nIf you inspected the template you would see that it creates an IAM role with only AWS Cost Explorer permissions (that's the \"ce:*\" reference in the template) to the Billgist application.\nYou can see the role created by the Billgist and the policy attached to the role in the AWS IAM roles in the AWS console.\nAdditionally, you can also see the created resources in the Resources tab of the CloudFormation console once you started integration process. \n\nBy this time you must be wondering how can I validate all this by myself. AWS provides an interface to display the role, trusted relationships and the policies attached to the role. \nYou can follow the steps below to see how. \nNavigate to AWS roles and search for the role start with \"billgist*\" or see the previous screenshot to get actual name of the role. Once you searched for the role click on it to see the details. \n\n\n\"Permissions\" tab will be selected by default and here you will be able to see the attached policies. Click on the policy and verify which service(s) access has been granted to the role.\n\n\n\nIn the \"Trust relationship\" tab you will be able to verify what are the trusted entities for the role. Make sure the trusted entity should be \"825617374672\" which is the Billgist AWS account\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nread only Cost Explorer API.

          "description": "The following are my favorite tips and tricks for working with Vim. I use Vim as my primary editor, and try to avoid the use of other IDEs and editors.\nIf you're new to vim, or looking to learn more about the features already available, here's a sample of my tips and tricks.\nVim is often used by Linux but it works on every system. It's included by default on Mac OS X.\nIf you type / then a search term, Vim will start searching forwards from the current cursor location for that word. \nTo search for the next occurrence of that search term, press n (for next); to search backwards press N . After pressing n or N , Vim will highlight all matching words, which you can then press on to select.\n\nOne of the most powerful features of Vim is its ability to use ex commands. First, in order to run ex commands, you must be in insert mode: that is to say, not at the beginning of a line. \nIt’s important to note that in order to enter insert mode, you must first exit normal mode. To do this, press “i” or “a” – these keys will start you off in insert mode at the beginning of a new line or at the end of your current line.\nNow that you’re in insert mode, you can type “:” and then an ex command.\nSome things you can do are:\n:5p print the fifth line\n:100p print line 100\n:%s/hello/world/ search and replace\n:!bash return to bash, type exit to open vim\nThis saves you quit a few keystrokes. Press the number of times you want to repeat, then press the key. To move 100 lines down, press 100j. To move up 50 lines, press 50k. To delete 5 lines press 5dd etc.\n\nVim supports keyboard macros. They let you record and replay your keystrokes. This is really great if you have some tedious typing to do.\nTo start recording press q followed by a. To stop recording press the ESC key. Then press @ followed by a to replay the keystrokes.\nIf you are new to vim, I recommend this course",

This blog post discusses four effective techniques to animate your application's user interface, covering popular use cases. You'll learn how to transform bland experiences into memorable ones for your users.\nI created a demo application to help you focus on adding animations to Angular. You'll add animations to a starter app as you progress through this tutorial. The starter application uses Tailwind to take care of its style and layout, but none of the animations discussed here are dependent on it.\nFollow this tutorial without cloning any repo, right in the browser using Stackblitz or CodeSandbox.\nIf you prefer to work locally in your IDE, clone the demo app and check out its starter branch:\ngit clone -b starter git@github.com:auth0-blog/angular-animations-storefront.git\n\nOnce you clone the repo, make angular-animations-storefront your current directory:\ncd angular-animations-storefront\n\nInstall the project's dependencies:\nnpm i\n\nRun the project locally:\nnpm run start\n\nAngular comes with a powerful animation module that lets you quickly add motion to your application: BrowserAnimationsModule. Under the hood, this module uses the Web Animations API (WAAPI) to create motion and interactivity. Whenever WAAPI isn't available, BrowserAnimationsModule falls back to using CSS keyframes. Angular animations give you the option to use their abstraction layer to animate any properties that the web considers animatable such as positions, sizes, colors, and many more.\nRead more...",
