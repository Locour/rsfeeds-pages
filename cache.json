This is important as I don't want my site to be a chatting platform.\nSo to sum up, I'm looking for an open-source NodeJS solution even some part of a NodeJS project that I can pick.

You're not the only one who feels this way. The issue of online privacy is crucial.\nYou can improve your online security against unwanted access to your data and privacy by taking several simple actions.\n1 \nBrowse in private mode or use a browser, which doesn't store and send your data.\nBrowsing in private mode can let you avoid your browser's history from tracing. However, these private modes aren't entirely private. Your ISP can observe your surfing behavior even if you're using an incognito or private mode.\ne.g.\nhttps://www.brave.com/\nhttps://www.beakerbrowser.com/\n2 \nBe cautious about where you click.\nPhishing attempts are one of the ways how hackers can compromise your online privacy. They frequently accomplish this by sending fake emails that look like from banks, credit card companies, etc. \n3 \nChange your search engine.\nIf you're like most web users, you use Google as your primary search engine.\ne.g.\nhttps://www.duckduckgo.com/\nhttps://www.startpage.com/\n4\nUse dedicated proxy servers. \nA dedicated proxy server acts as a private and secure connection point between users and the internet. It's a server that acts as an \"intermediary\" between end-users and the web pages they browse on the internet. An IP address is used when a computer connects to the internet.\nYou can compare it to your home's street address. It directs data to the appropriate destination while also providing a return address for other devices.\nA dedicated proxy server is a machine connected to the internet that has its unique IP address and serves as a disguise for your computer.\nThere are plenty of companies that provide such services, here is my personal top of the most reliable ones:\nhttps://www.dslrentals.com/\nhttps://www.proxy-hub.com/\nStay safe=)",

Theft attempt and other security threats can be controlled by using this simple circuit.\nFor the purpose of this application, we will design a security system for one room in a house. The sensor used for each opening can be either a mechanical switch, a magnetically operated switch, or an optical sensor. Detection of an intrusion can be used to initiate an audible alarm signal. \nWe will be using a mechanical switch as our sensor and use a transistor as a NOT gate, so that when there is an open switch in our room a transistor will show a signal that an intruder has entered.\nResistor\nTransistor\nBuzzer\nVoltage source\n\nRoom sensor is normally in a closed position and it is connected to a DC voltage source. When a door is open it creates an open circuit.\n\n\nTransistor switches are used for high power devices such as\nThe areas of operation for Transistor switch are known as the Saturation Region and the Cut-Off Region.\nCut-off Region: here there is a large depletion layer\n\n\nSaturation Region: here the depletion layer is as\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  NOT Gate Transistor\n\n\nA NOT gate simply inverts its input. If the input is high, the output is low, and if the input is low, the output is high\n\nThe operation of this circuit is simple. The input is connected through resistor R2 to the transistor’s\nWhen voltage is present at the input, the transistor turns on, allowing current to flow through the collector-emitter circuit directly to ground. This ground path creates a shortcut that bypasses the output, which causes the output to go low.\nWe run our simulation with a voltmeter connected to the output, in place of the buzzer .\n\nIn the normal state, the switch will be closed.\n\nWhen intrusion happens, the switch will open and the alarm (buzzer) will go off.",

Because pods are unstable, transient, and volatile, we can’t trust that the application will always be reachable via a pod’s IP.\nIn Kubernetes, a service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. The set of pods targeted by a service is usually determined by a selector. Kubernetes services provide addresses through which associated pods can be accessed.\nTake a look at the service.yaml file below:\napp:myapp.\n\n  \n  \n  Creating a Kubernetes Service\n\n\n\n\nkubectl apply -f service.yaml\n\nThe minikube tunnel command can be used to expose LoadBalancer services. To keep the LoadBalancer active, it must be run in a separate terminal window.\nminikube tunnel \n\nminikube tunnel runs as a process on the host and creates a network route to the cluster’s service CIDR using the cluster’s IP address as a gateway. The tunnel command gives any application on the host operating system immediate access to the external IP address.\nkubectl get service myapp\n\nYou should be able to see the external ip; earlier it would have been pending.\nminikube service --url myapp\n\nYou should be able to view this in your browser.\nWelcome to myapp!\nThe section about services is incomplete without an analogy from the dev life. \nIt’s Been a Long Article… and I Hope To Tell You More About It Next Time!\nWith that, we come to the end of the series on K8s made relatable and the adventures of the fresher on the first day.

It orchestrates virtual machine clusters and schedules containers to operate on those virtual machines depending on their available computational resources and the container’s resource needs. \nThey can be related with managers, who plan and coordinate developers to deliver projects and make sure they have all the resources required to do so.\nWe can use K8s to deploy our services, roll out new releases without downtime, and scale (or descale) those services.

          "description": "Firefox Beta\n\n\nFirefox 除了一般的版本之外，還另外有 Beta、Developer、Nightly 版，這些額外的預覽版本是用來供應給網頁開發者等等的早期用戶，這些早期用戶可以透過預覽版的 Firefox 來測試新的網頁技術，當然既然是預覽版那麼它們的穩定性一定是不如一般版的，喜歡嚐鮮或工作上對新的網頁技術有需求的朋友可以斟酌安裝。\nelementary OS 是以 Ubuntu Desktop 為基礎，再改用 elementary OS 自己的桌面環境而來，提供了比原本 Ubuntu Desktop 更美觀也更友善的桌面體驗，並且依然保留了 Ubuntu 的系統架構與沿用 Debian 流派的套件管理系統 APT，所以網路上對 Debian / Ubuntu 的文章大多也可以適用於 elementary OS。\n前面提到過 elemantary OS 是基於 Ubuntu 的，並且也是用 APT 作為套件管理系統，因此若要安裝普通版的 Firefox，則只要一行簡單的指令：\nsudo apt install firefox\n\n因為普通版的 Firefox 有被收錄在 Ubuntu 的套件庫內，而 elementary OS 也是有沿用 Ubuntu 的套件庫，才能安裝的這麼輕鬆寫意。\n然而如果想嘗試 Firefox Beta，你會發現好像有難度，在 Firefox Beta 的下載頁雖然有列出 Linux 版的下載包，但是它只提供 .tar.bz2 的壓縮包，雖然解開免安裝就可以用，但並未整合入 elementary OS 的 app 選單內，有點像以前 Windows 上的綠色軟體，但這不是我想要的，本人還是較偏好與 OS 能夠做到整合的做法，因此我們必須手動把 Firefox Beta 的 PPA 套件庫加入系統內。\nPPA，即 Personal Package Archive，是讓任何大眾可以寄存自己的 DEB 套件的平台，最大的 PPA 平台 Launchpad 也是由 Ubuntu 背後的公司 Canonical 所營運的。\nFirefox Beta PPA 的專案頁面。裡面的說明有教導我們如何把這個 PPA 套件庫加入我們的 elementary OS 之內，依照頁面的指示加入 PPA 套件庫：\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/firefox-next\n\n然後重整套件庫清單：\nsudo apt update\n\n最後安裝 Firefox Beta：\nsudo apt install firefox\n\n注意到，套件的名稱還是 firefox，也就是說這個 PPA 內的 Firefox Beta 的套件名稱還是 firefox，並且取代了原本 Ubuntu 套件庫的那個普通版的 firefox。\n安裝完之後我們的系統內的 Firefox 應該就會被取代成 Firefox Beta。",

          "description": "One of the most powerful features when creating Angular components is the Async Pipe. The greatest thing about it is that it allows you to take advantage of asynchronous rendering in your templates, but without having to worry about subscribing and unsubscribing from Observables.\nimport { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';\nimport { of, Subject } from 'rxjs';\nimport { delay, startWith, takeUntil } from 'rxjs/operators';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'my-app',\n  template: `\n    <h1>Async example</h1> \n    <h2>Items</h2> \n    <ul>\n      <li *ngFor=\"let item of items | async\">{{item}}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>Other Items</h2> \n    <ul>\n      <li *ngFor=\"let other of otherItems\">{{other}}</li>\n    </ul>\n  `,\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ]\n})\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy  {\n\n  items = of([1, 2, 3])\n    .pipe(\n      delay(2000), \n      startWith(['...'])\n    );\n\n  // vs \n\n  otherItems: any[];\n  private destroy$ = new Subject();\n  ngOnInit() {\n    of([1, 2, 3])\n      .pipe(\n        delay(2000),\n        startWith(['...']),\n        takeUntil(this.destroy$)\n      )\n      .subscribe(other  => this.otherItems = other)\n  }\n  ngOnDestroy() {\n    this.destroy$.next();\n    this.destroy$.complete();\n  }\n}\n\n\nCheck it out on Stackblitz.\nAs you can see, in the first example, we are rendering a list (items) using the async pipe in the HTML template. There is no need for the additional handling after the component is destroyed, which you can see is not the case for the other list otherItems.   That is simply because the async pipe is going to take care of that for you.",

In such scenarios most of the time BehaviorSubject is used which acts as a single store to hold updated shared data.\nBehaviorSubject is both observer and type of observable.\nBehaviorSubject always need an initial/default value.\nEvery observer on subscribe gets current value.\nCurrent value is either latest value emitted by source observable using next() method or initial/default value.\nLet’s implement BehaviorSubject to understand a concept better!\nFor e.g In order tracking app, display total items in cart and total items in wish list on UI in header and dashboard section based on user action.\nNow we have three components -\n\nRun Live\nWhen user add items in the cart/wishList, total count needs to be updated in the header and dashboard component.\n1.First create a BehaviorSubject in order service which holds the initial state of order count ,so that it can be used by any component.\n\n\n\n\n3.When a user performs any action, call the next() method of source observable. When the next() method gets called it will update current count with new count and notifies updated count to all observers(3 Components) who subscribed to source observable.\n\nThis way BehaviorSubject makes components communication more effective.\nThanks for reading!

Elasticsearch allows you to store & search huge volumes of data very quickly in near real-time and give back responses in milliseconds. Yes you heard that right milliseconds... It's able to achieve these fast search speeds/responses because instead of searching the text directly, it searches through an index. It uses a structure based on documents instead of tables and schemas.\nI created this template because I haven't seen many templates for Elasticsearch & Typescript and even tutorials covering this so I decided to create one to make peoples lives easier.\nYou can get started here!, Just follow the README on how to setup your environment variables, and setting up the server.\n⭐s are much appreciated! :)",

The first being the keys in the object:\n- type SchemeNames = \"background\" | \"textColor\" | \"highlightOne\"\n+ type SchemaNames = keyof typeof scheme\n\nIdealy you might have noticed the 'key of' in the comment, which could have led you to keyof, from there you needed to re-use typeof to extract the type from scheme.

You may think that this is another Rest API like all the others but in this example, we will be using a lot of TypeScript advanced features that will be really helpful for this demo. But we will be more focused on using TypeScript instead of the business logic implementation. I suggest using VSCode in this example because it provides a lot of features with TypeScript.\nThe API we will be making will focus on Dogs. Our endpoints will look like this.\nGET /api/v1/dogs\nGET /api/v1/dogs/:id\nPOST /api/v1/dogs\nPUT /api/v1/dogs/:id\nDELETE /api/v1/dogs/:id\n\n\nFirst, make a folder, you can name it whatever you want.

As for me, I created a component library for my organisation which is supposed to be used across multiple react projects. There I implemented Storybook(in component library project) so that everyone can have a preview of all components provided by the internal-component-library and use it according to the (kind of) storybook generated docs based on props.\nMake sure you have installed or created a new react project with\nnpx create-react-app storybook-ts-blog\n\nNow storybook can handle the setup part, just run the below command.\nnpx sb init\n\nIt will install storybook and add the necessary files for you to work with storybook.\nRun storybook using below command\nnpm run storybook\n\nMaybe you should also host the component library even if it's an internal project as it will help anyone other than devs(designers, managers) to have a look at your mess🤪(just kidding, I mean your components), just add basic authentication(username+password) before showing the hosted website.\nTo generate HTML files to host, run the below command\nnpm run build-storybook -- -o ./path/to/build\n\nTo run the build locally, use this command\nnpx http-server ./path/to/build",
