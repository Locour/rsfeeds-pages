          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

It's basically (M)odular (J)ava(S)cript. The standardization itself is called ECMAScript Modules (ESM).\nBy default, the Node.js platform doesn't use ES modules but CommonJS, which is a different module formatting system. Fortunately, the Node.js team introduced the concept of ES modules back in 2017 with Node v8.9.0. At that time, you could run Node.js with an additional flag (--experimental-modules) to make use of it.\nSince Node v13.2.0 the experimental flag is no longer required. It only takes a few steps now to use an ECMAScript module. Let me show you how to do it.\nSetting up an ES module is simple: Just create a file with the *.mj…",

Just make sure you are using the right installer for your distribution/OS\nBy the way, Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6 (>=2.28) or libc6 (>=2.29) is referred to as the same problem\nOK, Let me explain a bit further,  A few months ago I was wanted to install VirtualBox on my Linux Mint computer, So, I went to the VirtualBox Official website (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads) but I won't found the installer for Linux Mint Version ( It's still not present here as you can see in the picture below)\n\nSo, I downloaded  Ubuntu 19.10 / 20.04 / 20.10 / 21.04 version because I knew Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu. so, whatever works on Ubuntu should be work on Linux Mint as well. It was not a big deal. But it won't worked and threw this Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6 (>=2.28) error.\n\nAt that moment I reconsider my OS. I was using Linux Mint 19.3 Cinnamon. OS version placed a critical role here. I simply Googled \"Linux Mint 19.3 Ubuntu Version\"  and found Mint 19.3 is based on Ubuntu 18.04 . \nI revisit the download page and download it again but now from the  Ubuntu 18.04 / 18.10 / 19.04  option and run the installer and Guess what, It was running absolutely fine without any issue. Through the installer required some extra dependency, not an issue, just allowed it\n\nMaybe you downloaded the Debian 10 version installer, not working.. then download it for Debian 9. Fedora 33/34 not working... download it for Fedora 32. Just make sure that the VirtualBox installer is compatible with your OS version :)\nShare your thoughts if you find something more interesting...\nWatch on YouTube\n\n\nThanks for reading.

It was not a big deal. But it won't worked and threw this Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6 (>=2.28) error.\n\nAt that moment I reconsider my OS. I was using Linux Mint 19.3 Cinnamon. OS version placed a critical role here. I simply Googled \"Linux Mint 19.3 Ubuntu Version\"  and found Mint 19.3 is based on Ubuntu 18.04 . \nI revisit the download page and download it again but now from the  Ubuntu 18.04 / 18.10 / 19.04  option and run the installer and Guess what, It was running absolutely fine without any issue. Through the installer required some extra dependency, not an issue, just allowed it\n\nMaybe you downloaded the Debian 10 version installer, not working.. then download it for Debian 9. Fedora 33/34 not working... download it for Fedora 32. Just make sure that the VirtualBox installer is compatible with your OS version :)\nShare your thoughts if you find something more interesting...\nWatch on YouTube\n\n\nThanks for reading. Have a great day :)\nCoffee https://www.buymeacoffee.com/rahedmir",

          "description": "The world is going Linux. At least that's what we tell ourselves every time we open a terminal window and type in a cryptic series of characters that do nothing but make us more frustrated than we were when we started. If you've ever considered using Linux, but aren't sure where to start, this guide is for you.\nThe command line might seem intimidating at first, but it's actually not so bad. You can use the GUI (Graphical User Interface) if you want, but the terminal has a lot of cool features that make using Linux much easier.\nIf you're on Ubuntu and want to see what commands you have available, just hit the CTRL+ALT+T key combination and a box will appear in the top left corner showing you all the different programs available. \n\nLinux commands are essentially small bundles of text designed to perform a specific task, such as move files from one location to another or run a program.\nThe Linux command line is not intimidating once you learn a few basic commands. The following are some of the most common commands and cover a wide range of tasks you might want to do.\nThe cd command stands for \"change directory\" and it changes the current working directory on your computer. It's very useful for navigating around your filesystem.\nFor example, if you're in your home directory and want to get to /etc/hosts, you could type:\ncd /etc/hosts\n\nYou could also do this if you're already in /etc/hosts but want to go back up one directory:\ncd ..\n\nIf you want to see what's in your current working directory, use the ls command like this: ls.\nls\n\nThis will list all of the files and directories in the current working directory.\nThere are many other commands that accomplish the same tasks for some commands, such as cp (copy) and mv (move).\ncp file /home/user/Desktop/\n\nThere's a lot more to learn, but the commands in this article will serve you well no matter which Linux distro you're using. They even work on Mac OS X and on the BSD systems.\nIf you are new to the command line, I recommend this site",

          "description": "⌨️ Improve the User Experience (UX) of an e-commerce application by implementing animations utilizing Angular animations, CSS animations, and Web Animation APIs.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \nDevelopers can use animations in meaningful and non-distracting ways to significantly improve their application's user experience (UX). This blog post discusses four effective techniques to animate your application's user interface, covering popular use cases. You'll learn how to transform bland experiences into memorable ones for your users.\nI created a demo application to help you focus on adding animations to Angular. You'll add animations to a starter app as you progress through this tutorial. The starter application uses Tailwind to take care of its style and layout, but none of the animations discussed here are dependent on it.\nFollow this tutorial without cloning any repo, right in the browser using Stackblitz or CodeSandbox.\nIf you prefer to work locally in your IDE, clone the demo app and check out its starter branch:\ngit clone -b starter git@github.com:auth0-blog/angular-animations-storefront.git\n\nOnce you clone the repo, make angular-animations-storefront your current directory:\ncd angular-animations-storefront\n\nInstall the project's dependencies:\nnpm i\n\nRun the project locally:\nnpm run start\n\nAngular comes with a powerful animation module that lets you quickly add motion to your application: BrowserAnimationsModule. Under the hood, this module uses the Web Animations API (WAAPI) to create motion and interactivity. Whenever WAAPI isn't available, BrowserAnimationsModule falls back to using CSS keyframes. Angular animations give you the option to use their abstraction layer to animate any properties that the web considers animatable such as positions, sizes, colors, and many more.\nRead more...",

          "description": "I made a library to generate development infrastructure for typescript project.\nchore-cli is the super assistant for building a typescript library. It can generate development infrastructure for projects or libraries, such as prettier, eslint, husky etc, or even Github Actions Config files. It can save a lot of time every time you create new stuff.\nAs we know, These tools like eslint, prettier can make the codebase better. But it takes us a lot of time to configure them. If you don't want your enthusiasm for writing code to be consumed by these configurations, and if you don't like doing these annoying \"chores\" frequently, try chore-cli.\nIt's easy to use：\nnpx chore-cli <path-to-project>\n\n\nTake a look at the README.md for examples and further documentation, and let me know if you find any bugs, or you have any idea for improving it.",
