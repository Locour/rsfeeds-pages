You can solve the problem a great deal by getting a security tool that automates the process for you. Additionally, it helps to revops your business.\nThat being said, there are steps that can help you in preventing security threats to a certain extent. Today, in this post, we are going to look at the different dimensions of e-commerce security and the proven measures that enhance it.\nE-commerce security is one of the most important aspects of running a successful e-commerce store.

          "description": "Simple is not easy, easy is not simple\nLet's first get that out of the way. People are often equating easiness with simplicity, but they are very different words.\nSimple (vs complex) - from \"sim plex\", literally: one-fold (i.e. not braided)\n\n\nEasy (vs hard) - from \"lying at, lie near\"; familiar, near to our understanding\n\n\n\nRich Hickey goes more into details about this in his presentation. If you haven't already, check it out (I don't agree with everything he said, but it's a good presentation, definitely worth watching).\nMost often, achieving simplicity is the hardest thing to do in software development and usually it requires an enormous experience.\nSimplicity is probably the most important aspect of software development. As Edsger Dijkstra put it, \"Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability\".\nIf your design is not simple, the whole thing will eventually become fragile, unreliable and starting to fall apart.\nUnfortunately, complexity sells much better and when you combine that with cargo-cult programming and resume driven development, you get the modern web development mess.\nThe same goes for modern system administration (or devops, if you will) - if you've been working with UNIX long enough, all you need to do is take a look at kubernetes mess.\nI created devsimplicity.com as a simple, wiki-like place, focused mostly on addressing those issues, avoiding complexity traps and as a quick way to find&explore the better/saner alternatives. There's still lot of work to do, but it's getting better. If you like the idea, stay tuned.\nNote: This is a snapshot of a wiki topic on devsimplicity.com and may be outdated.

Nowadays, many production environments employ containers in one form or another, running on developers' workstations, locally hosted servers and/or the cloud.\nIf you have worked as a developer or administrator in the industry, chances are you've worked with modern container runtimes such as Docker and Kubernetes or at least heard of them. From a high-level perspective, containers are an OS-level abstraction - a stripped down operating system (OS) containing one or more applications (apps) of interest running atop some host in an isolated manner, which provides an extra layer of security compared to running the app(s) directly on the host and enables the app(s) to be executed on different hosts (possibly with different hardware) in a consistent, rep‚Ä¶",

In this post, we‚Äôll go through the steps to ensure that your script will run correctly üòâ\nThe first step is to make a bash script. Any bash script uses the Linux commands.  A script can simply be a file with a list of commands and the .sh extension. If you are new to Linux, you can use this site to practice. \nThe second step is to make sure that your script file is executable. In Linux and macOS, you can check if a file is executable by running the ls -l command and then looking for an x in the permissions column. \nThe example below shows the difference:\n$ ls -l *.sh\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 frank frank   43 mei 29 16:30 hello.sh\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 frank frank 8192 jul  1 19:41 not-executable.sh\n\nIf it isn‚Äôt executable, run the following command in Terminal.\nchmod +x script.sh\n\nTo start a script you write:\n./script.sh\n\nI can write a shell script when I need to, but then continue working in Python or Perl or C++ or whatever real programming language I'm most comfortable with at the time (these days mostly C++).\nFor example, one of my recent side projects involved crunching data from a database, working with various embedded systems and more. Shell is not the right tool for that kind of application.\nBash is more suited for when you write a lot of commands in the shell anyway and want to automate that.",

But it can also be used inside modern IDEs (vim mode) and there are graphical versions as well (gVim)\nIn this post, I'm going to lay out a Hacker's Guide to Vim. This will be a collection of the best \"Vim resources\" that I have come across. \nVim is a very complex tool with hundreds of commands and thousands of plugins that can be used to extend Vim and add functionality. So where do you start?\nYou can learn vim by exercise. This site offers interactive exercises. Vim is one of the programs you learn by doing.\nOf course, the official vim website is a good resource as well. It has some documentation and lets you download vim. If you use Linux vim or vi is probably already installed, the same for Mac OS X users.\nHow to setup vim for Python. I find it quite useful, as I write quite a lot of Python code. Of course you can write Python code in any editor you want, I find for small scripts it's very practical to fire up vim.\nAn introduction to vim. This article shows you the basics of vim. How to open a terminal, vim and how to quit (ESC ZQ).\nSettings up vim for javascript. If you write a lot of JS code, you can use vim. You can also use vim-mode inside visual studio code or phpstorm.\nA cheatsheet for vim. Shows an overview for the vim commands. While a cheat sheet is useful, i think it's better to practice a lot with the commands.\nA list of vim plugins. Personally I use NerdTree quite a bit.\nDo you know any others?

          "description": "This article talks about an efficient way to implement auto-complete feature using Angular concepts. The key components used in this demonstration are as follows:\nAngular Material (v12) Autocomplete module.\nRxJS for action and data binding.\nAngular in-memory-web-api for REST services (Refer to in-memory-web-api).\n¬†\n\n¬†\n\n¬†\n\n\n\n\nLet us now see how we go about it:\nThe front-end consists of an angular autocomplete module. The input event taps the user's keystrokes and emits a new value into an action subject.\n\nAutocompleteService class.\n\nThe action BehaviorSubject starts with an empty string. The action$ is an observable built out of this subject.\n\nGET request. Since this is a higher-order observable (i.e., an observable returning an observable), we make use of one of the higher order functions like switchMap.\n\nswitchMap (and not other higher order functions like concatMap or mergeMap)? The reason is: switchMap unsubscribes from the previous observable once a new value is emitted by the parent observable.\nWhat this means is - as soon as the user types in another letter or removes a letter, there is simply no need to subscribe and execute the rest call for the previous values. The user is only interested to see the results of the search according to his/her current input. And switchMap does this automatically, and thus gets rid of unwanted rest calls.\nWe can also get additional control on when to fire the rest service depending on the length of the user's input. For example, in this demo, I fire the rest call only when the user has entered at least 2 characters. If not, then I return an observable of empty array (using of([])).\n¬†\n\n\n  \n  \n  Back to the Component:\n\n\nWe tap onto the above observable and use async pipe to subscribe to it. Since we are completely using observables, we can also use the OnPush change-detection-strategy.\n\n¬†\n@angular/cli - 12.1.0\nGitHub\n¬†\nCheers!",

With it, you can build efficient native, web, and mobile apps with a wide range of tools and libraries it integrates. However, there are still ways apps built with it can be improved. For example, using Angular Universal, you can render your apps server-side to speed up page loads and improve SEO and performance.\nServer-side rendering involves converting an app to HTML on a server. When you send a request for a particular path to the server, it returns an entirely static HTML page as a response.

          "description": "Nullish Coelescing in TypeScript is practically a shortcut for the ternary operator, achieved by using ?? between statements or values.\nThe double question marks work from left to right. Take the basic example below:\nconst value1 = undefined;\nconst value2 = 6;\n\nconst result = value1 ?? value2;\n\nconsole.log(result); // returns 6\n\nThis reads as follows:\n\"If value1 is not null or undefined and has an actual value, then return that value. However, if value1 does not have a value, then return value2\"\nIt's important to note that in the case of nullish coelescing, only null or undefined are being checked specifically. This should not be confused with checking for \"truthyness\" like the logical || operator would.\nTake the below examples as a final explanation on this:\nconst b = \"\" ?? 42;\nconsole.log(b); // returns \"\"\n\nconst c = false ?? 42;\nconsole.log(c); // returns false\n\nconst d = NaN ?? 42;\nconsole.log(d); // returns NaN\n\nconst e = -0 ?? 42;\nconsole.log(e) // returns -0",

          "description": "The graph is a data structure that consists of vertices (or nodes) that can be connected to other vertices by edges.\n\nThe degree is the number of edges that are connected to a vertex, for example, the vertex A has a degree of 1 and the vertex C has a degree of 2.\nGraphs can be either directed or undirected, directed graphs are like a one-way street, undirected is like a two-way street.\n\nGraphs can also have cycles.\n\nGraphs might be a disconnected one, that means it consists of isolated subgraphs, or a connected one, in which all every pair of nodes are connected by an edge.\n\nGraphs can be used to represent networks, websites structure, also used in path optimization algorithms, there are applications in other fields, such as linguistics, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, etc.\nGraph‚Ä¶",
