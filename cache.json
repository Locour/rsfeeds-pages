          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

It automates deployment tasks so you don‚Äôt need to worry about introducing errors and configures everything the way you would expect it to be set up out of the box.\nAccording to the official website, Claudia‚Äôs primary objective is to help JavaScript developers get started using Lambda microservices easily so they can ‚Äúfocus on solving important business problems instead of dealing with AWS deployment workflows.‚Äù\nIn this section, we‚Äôll walk you through setting up an example Node.js and Express.js app to show Claudia.js in action.\nClaudia.js is available on npm. The simplest way to use Claudia.js is to install it as a global utility:\n\nnpm install -g claudia\n\n\nInstall the Express.js app generator using npm:\n\nnpm install express-generator -g\n\nexpress claudia-demo\n\ncd claudia-demo\n\nnpm i\n\n\nThe Express.js app will be hosted by a Lambda function, so it needs a handler to send data between the app and the API Gateway. This is where Claudia.js comes in. Claudia uses aws-serverless-express to generate a helper function to interface between API Gateway requests and Express.js requests and responses.\nExecute the command below in your project directory. If you have renamed your Express.js application module, replace app with the name of the main Express.js application module:\n$ claudia generate-serverless-express-proxy --express-module\napp\n\nYour app is now ready to go live:\n\nclaudia create --handler lambda.handler \\ \n   --deploy-proxy-api \\ \n   --region us-east-1 \n\n\n Claudia",

Why not just keep it in the newer version? Well, some of our CI/CD pipelines used an older version of Terraform (say 0.12), and while none of the resource states actually changed, our code would no longer run after a developer ran something locally on their computer with a newer version of Terraform (say 0.14). \nSo!

It automates deployment tasks so you don‚Äôt need to worry about introducing errors and configures everything the way you would expect it to be set up out of the box.\nAccording to the official website, Claudia‚Äôs primary objective is to help JavaScript developers get started using Lambda microservices easily so they can ‚Äúfocus on solving important business problems instead of dealing with AWS deployment workflows.‚Äù\nIn this section, we‚Äôll walk you through setting up an example Node.js and Express.js app to show Claudia.js in action.\nClaudia.js is available on npm. The simplest way to use Claudia.js is to install it as a global utility:\n\nnpm install -g claudia\n\n\nInstall the Express.js app generator using npm:\n\nnpm install express-generator -g\n\nexpress claudia-demo\n\ncd claudia-demo\n\nnpm i\n\n\nThe Express.js app will be hosted by a Lambda function, so it needs a handler to send data between the app and the API Gateway. This is where Claudia.js comes in. Claudia uses aws-serverless-express to generate a helper function to interface between API Gateway requests and Express.js requests and responses.\nExecute the command below in your project directory. If you have renamed your Express.js application module, replace app with the name of the main Express.js application module:\n$ claudia generate-serverless-express-proxy --express-module\napp\n\nYour app is now ready to go live:\n\nclaudia create --handler lambda.handler \\ \n   --deploy-proxy-api \\ \n   --region us-east-1 \n\n\n Claudia",

          "description": "Developers are always looking for simpler ways to do more advanced things in less time, and one of the many ways that they can achieve this is by using a selection of tools to supplement their workflow. The aim of this article is to cover some of the major tools that people use, and to give you an insight into what they can do to make your life easier.\nAnd to seal the deal, all the tools I‚Äôll be mentioning are completely free to use, which is an incredible price for what you‚Äôre getting from them.\nGit / Version Control\nGit is the most well-known version control tool out there. It allows you to store your code on a server (thereby reducing data-loss risks), collaborate with other developers and share your code online. Another huge plus to Git is that it allows you to go and look at other people‚Äôs public repositories, and see how they solved certain problems. This can then help you solve the problem in your application, and it can save you lots of time and effort.\nGit is open-source itself and it comes with a huge selection of extensions that allow you to modify the functionality of the system in a huge range of different ways.\nThe fact that Git allows you to go back and review previous versions of your code, see how it‚Äôs changed and keep track of issues as well as provide you with lots of automation tools makes it quite clear that Git, or a Git alternative is a must-have for nearly every project.\nWhilst you could install a system like Gitea on a VPS and then run your own Git server, there is a selection of different services out there that provide Git repository hosting as a service. These services often come with lots of extras too, and usually a very generous free tier. The most notable Git host out there is definitely GitHub, but it is closely rivalled by GitLab among other solutions.\nWant to read more?

I created a couple of reusable artifacts and it in a way became a base for my second YouTube channel.\nThings kept breaking, and I found myself spending more time on fixing things than I expected, even with my prior experience with Linux before I spent four years on macOS.\n\n\n\n\nSo I started looking out for alternatives and found the exact thing I was looking for.\nI couldn't lose the control I had over my Linux setup back with Arch by delegating it to a graphical installer. So I installed Debian in the way we usually do install Arch.\n\n\n\n\nAll this learning had to be documented somewhere so I created another video talking about the process in a little bit of detail.\nMoving to Debian meant re-setting up the entire machine, even deeper than what I had to do back when I moved the factory-installed Windows to a smaller partition to make space for my primary Linux partition.\n\n\n\n\nThe new setup took away a few issues I never got fixed, and in exchange, brought with it a few other ones. I talked about the similarities, differences, negatives, and most importantly, the positives of the migration in a separate video, adding another episode to my series Back to Linux.\nAs I did last time, I'll keep my eyes open for ways to improve my setup and workflow, and will keep documenting my learning to be able to share them with the rest of the community.\nNeedless to say, I'm loving the alternate universe with Debian. Do throw in your ideas and thoughts in the comments and hopefully, we can learn something from each other.",

          "description": "Hi, I want to write about some technical discussion about system designs, architecture designs, programming techniques and how to deal with troubles in real-world but I've found that it is very difficult to just explain topics via multiple arbitrary and unconnected examples. I've got some topics in my mind but I cannot convey them into words. My writing is not good enough. So I'm thinking of implementing some real product while writing about it at a same time. I can post all the design considerations here and will receive feedbacks which will help me (and maybe other people) a lot.\nThe problem is that I cannot think of any ideas about software/applications that are not only practical but also useful for real-life use cases. Simple case studies are good but I'm afraid of that the readers will lose the interest. So any suggestion would be welcome and appreciate.\nThank you very much.",
