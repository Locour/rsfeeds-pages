          "description": "In the past two years, I have written a few blog posts that explored how to figure out where the user physically is.  Most of these experiments involved navigator.geolocation but last week's iOS 15, Private Relay, and Geolocation post brought in the concept of figuring out the person's location based upon their IP address.  After finishing that post, I started to wonder what it would take to simplify things.  Can I reduce the number of API calls to things and make the result more reliable?  In the process, I decided that I would also wrap things up into a central Cloudflare worker.\nSo, let's see what the guts of the worker look like.\nAs you can see above, a lot of the returned data is just things that cloudflare knows about you, out of the gate but in order to get your likely street address, an API call to Mapquest is still needed.  I also set it up so that you can pass latitude and longitude values in as get variables.  If the user is on an LTE or 5g connection, their location is likely to show up as being in a completely different place.\nSo, how do we implement this new API?\n\n\n\n\nUsing the \"Use GPS to update position\" and \"Use IP to update position\" buttons, you can toggle between the two modes of detection.  Basically, one passes lat/long coordinates into the API and the other leaves it up to the node script to figure it out.\nIn a real-world setting, I would execute the IP-based detection by default and give the user the option to use the more accurate option if they wished to do so.  This is definitely getting integrated into my Wisconsin State Parks project.\nHave any questions, comments, etc?  Feel free to drop a comment, below.",

This tremendously popular JavaScript runtime environment is praised by developers for its flexibility and effectiveness. And as a matter of fact, exactly the same can be claimed about microservice architecture. What are the benefits of both, and why in most cases is it a good idea to build an application based on microservices in Node.js, especially a SaaS one? Let’s find out.\nA microservice is a software design pattern, where a group of interconnected services builds the entire application, in contrast to the monolithic approach to software development, where the application is built as one unit. These services are responsible for one function, they’re loosely coupled, isolated from the others, and ind…",

          "description": "Introduction\n\n\nThe security alarm system will use a bipolar junction transistor switch to detect security problems. Theft attempt and other security threats can be controlled by using this simple circuit.\nFor the purpose of this application, we will design a security system for one room in a house. The sensor used for each opening can be either a mechanical switch, a magnetically operated switch, or an optical sensor. Detection of an intrusion can be used to initiate an audible alarm signal. \nWe will be using a mechanical switch as our sensor and use a transistor as a NOT gate, so that when there is an open switch in our room a transistor will show a signal that an intruder has entered.\nResistor\nTransistor\nBuzzer\nVoltage source\n\nRoom sensor is normally in a closed position and it is connected to a DC voltage source. When a door is open it creates an open circuit.\n\n\nTransistor switches are used for high power devices such as\nThe areas of operation for Transistor switch are known as the Saturation Region and the Cut-Off Region.\nCut-off Region: here there is a large depletion layer\n\n\nSaturation Region: here the depletion layer is as\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  NOT Gate Transistor\n\n\nA NOT gate simply inverts its input. If the input is high, the output is low, and if the input is low, the output is high\n\nThe operation of this circuit is simple. The input is connected through resistor R2 to the transistor’s\nWhen voltage is present at the input, the transistor turns on, allowing current to flow through the collector-emitter circuit directly to ground. This ground path creates a shortcut that bypasses the output, which causes the output to go low.\nWe run our simulation with a voltmeter connected to the output, in place of the buzzer .\n\nIn the normal state, the switch will be closed.\n\nWhen intrusion happens, the switch will open and the alarm (buzzer) will go off.",

          "description": "Since its initial placement on Coinbase on January 30, 2021, the coin has increased by 7,99,900% in just nine months. During the review period, Shiba Inu transformed a Rs 1,000 investment into Rs 80 lakh.\nShiba Inu, the latest meme craze, has recently been the most talked about token in the crypto industry. Shiba Inu has risen 75% in the previous 24 hours while big tokens are suffering with 10% cuts.\nShiba Inu has reached a lifetime high of $0.00008 thanks to its remarkable rise. Its market cap is now hovering around $50 billion, making it the eighth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\nSharat Chandra, a blockchain and emerging technology evangelist, said the current spike in the \"Dogecoin killer\" has been unreal, with it racing past altcoins like as Uniswap, Luna, Polkadot, and XRP.\nShiba Inu has surpassed Elon Musk's favourite meme token, Dogecoin, to become the most valuable meme token. Dogecoin fell more than 10%, dropping to 11th place on the cryptocurrency ladder.\nShiba Inu now has a larger market cap than Dogecoin for the first time. It is now worth more than Wipro, HCL Tech, Avenue Supermarts, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finserv, and L&T, among other Indian bluechip firms.\nIn the last seven days, the cryptocurrency has increased by more than 200 percent. It has risen by more than 1,200% in the previous three months alone.\nAn unknown crypto whale purchased 276.6 billion Shiba Inu tokens for around $11.5 million, according to statistics from WhaleStats, which follows the activity of the 1,000 largest Ether wallets, causing the rally to continue.\nAccording to analysts, investors should understand that memecoins have no fundamental value and only increase due to the network effect of a large community and fan following. These are not assets that can be held and used to build wealth over time.\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, recently snubbed Shiba Inu by revealing that he does not own any Shiba Inu tokens and instead holds Dogecoin in addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum.",

For example, you can specify a VID list or tags (with their indexes) to query vertices, or specify one or more VIDs to query a subgraph. When the queried vertices are retrieved, you can select one or more for further exploration. For example, you can query for the shared neighbors and the related paths of each pair of vertices. Through progressive queries, you can improve and enrich the data on the canvas for further graph analysis.\n\nWhen the graph data is retrieved, you can manipulate it on the canvas flexibly, including drag-and-drop, zoom-in or zoom-out, click-and-drag, and marking vertices with colors or icons. Nebula Explorer enables you to have fun with the graph data model by providing various features.\n\nBesides querying and exploring data, Nebula Explorer will support graph computing in the future, which will enable the Nebula Graph users to use appropriate methods to query and analyze graph data in various business scenarios.\nCurrently, Nebula Explorer is only available for Enterprise users. If you are interested, please send an email with “Require Dashboard” as the subject to inquiry@vesoft.com.\nIf you encounter any problems in the process of using Nebula Graph, please refer to Nebula Graph Database Manual to troubleshoot the problem.

This backend service implemented its own caching layer to provide a faster response time and also cut down on the number of times Salesforce needed to be called.\nIn “Leveraging Salesforce Using a Client Written In Svelte,” I introduced a simple client written in Svelte, which made it possible to update the Salesforce data using an inline editor—again, without actually using the Salesforce client.\nThe “Leveraging Salesforce Using a Client Written In…",

          "description": "If we use OnPush change detection strategy, immutability is helpful to ensure change detection works expectedly. \nOne of the way to enforce immutability is using Immutable.js. However, using Immutable.js is not really straightforward. It adds another layer instead of using JS object directly e.g\nconst apps = List([{ name: 'slack' }, { name: 'skype' }]);\napps.get(0); // { name: 'slack' }\n\nconst app = Map({ name: 'slack' });\nmap.get(\"name\"); // 'slack'\n\n// Using Record if we want to access property directly\nconst AppRecord = Record({\n    name: ''\n});\n\nclass App extends AppRecord {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n    }\n}\n\nconst newApp = new App({ name: 'slack' });\nnewApp.name; // 'slack'\n\nWe have to use get when using List and Map. Using Record could solve the issue, but if we have a very large object, using Record will be hard to maintain because we need to create each record per object and it's nested object.\nOther issue is about JS compatibility because it needs to use fromJS and toJS methods to convert from and to JS object. \nI'd say that I'm not a fan of that lib and it makes things more complicated. \nOther possible approach I'm thinking of: \nreadonly + ESLint immutable\n\n\nSince Angular using Typescript, let's use Readonly<T>, ReadonlyArray to enforce immutability. \nAlso add this no-mutation ESLint rule as extra protection https://github.com/jonaskello/eslint-plugin-functional/blob/master/docs/rules/immutable-data.md\nis there any better approach? \nThank you",

They specialize in the efficient data processing.\nSTH can be treated both as a data processing engine and execution platform for multiple sequences running on the same platform and performing various data processing tasks. \nWe named our apps \"sequences\" and that term describes well its nature, as they process data through a sequence of chained functions. Therefore usually, our sequences are concise and easy to write ,and powerful at the same time.\nOur vanilla STH engine is based on Node.js and thus allows developers to benefit from the rich ecosystem and many packages and solutions provided b…",

The people who have built REST APIs will understand what I am trying to express here. \nBut since a long time I have been hearing about this new guy (at least new for me, actually its quite oldish) called GraphQL. They say that it can build the most efficient APIs. No API, including REST and SOAP APIs, are as good and efficient as GraphQL, because unlike REST, GraphQL has a single endpoint and gives you a flexible approach of fetching data from the server as a client.

It was developed by HashiCorp\nTerraform CDK is a tool developed by terraform developers which allows you to write your infrastructure in your favorite language\nIt supports TypeScript, Python, C#, Go(Beta), and Java Currently.\nBefore we get started install cdktf-cli by running npm i -g cdktf-cli@latest and then run cdktf init to initialize a broiler code for you. Choose the language and name as your choice. For this instance, I will be using typescript.\n\nLet's add AWS providers and try to make an EC2 Instance. There are some prebuilt providers like the following for typescript. So in this case we install the AWS provider by running npm i @cdktf/provider-aws\n\nIf in case you are using any other language then you can add your providers to the terraformProviders field in the cdktf.json file and run cdktf get to install the constructs and convert them to your native language\nHere's my Typescript Code\nRunning cdktf synth will create a directory called cdktf.out where you will have your stack named folder which contains the terraform files.\nNow you can run terraform init & terraform plan to initialize terraform and review your infrastructure resources and if you want to go ahead and apply the changes run terraform apply\nYou must have to terraform installed in order for cdktf to work. You can Download the latest version by visiting this link\n\nIf you guys want me write the same for other language do let me know in the comment section below",
