You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

It enables clients to specify queries and allows servers to validate data against a strongly typed schema.\nUnlike REST APIs, GraphQL uses a single endpoint for all operations. GraphQL-based servers can only communicate via GraphQL queries. For simple projects, it’s feasible to use a REST client, like Axios or fetch(), to send GraphQL queries. However, for larger, more complex projects that have advanced requirements, a GraphQL client is needed.\nGraphQL clients make communication easier by abstracting away small details and implementing additional features, some of which include caching, query batching and deduplication, and static typing of GraphQL query results.\nIn this guide, we’ll compare the following…",

          "description": "Managing the global state of a web application is one of the biggest challenges we face today. Although we have several solutions, I think the biggest problem is that we use certain libraries that need a huge boilerplate even if you need to make a small change.\nOne of the libraries that makes life easier for me in my opinion is Jotai. Which in my opinion has an approach that greatly simplifies managing the global states of our applications.\nOther libraries already take the worry out of how you should structure our react components, but on the other hand they force us to structure our stores. However with Jotai it's super simple, you declare one thing or another and start using it (it's literally like that).\nWhen I use a library that needs a lot of boilerplate and a whole structure, if the …",

Check out this article how to do it correctly.\nI am an open-source developer working on Databunker. Today I got a question from one of the guys on a social network.\nIt is totally true, you can go DIY. On the other hand, Databunker grew to be a better solution than you can think about.\nDatabunker is a special application server used for the secure storage of customer data. It is not a full-fledged database. In the backend, it is using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite to store encrypted customer records. The product comes with full GDPR compliance and is built with privacy-by-design architecture.\nAny company implementing Databunker has a quick and easy way for GDPR and privacy-by-design compliance in addition to much better security.\nHashicorp Vault is a great product. It is built for completely different use cases.\nFor example, when saving records in Databunker, Databunker knows to extract user email, phone, login identity, and custom identity and built a secure hashed-based index to do a quick user record lookup.\nUser record CRUD is just a part of the service. In Databunker, you have a secure session storage API, temp shareable identities API, automatic record expiration and removal, compliance with pseudonymization, DPO management, user-accessible UI, and more.\nBesides you can go with a free version with an MIT license.\nIt is up to you to go with Databunker or build your own solution.\nJust do not leave customer data unencrypted.\nMore info:\nhttps://databunker.org/\nhttps://github.com/securitybunker/databunker",

Vim is a great option for doing this, or probably the best out there! Because Vim is pre-installed in almost every Linux distribution. This is not an in-depth setup for BASH on Vim, it is a simple editorial on starting up BASH scripting on the Vim editor. So without wasting time on \"Vim features\" let's dive in with the setup for BASH in Vim.\nSetting up a bash script doesn't require much code but still in some cases it can be a bit hassle and to avoid the repetitive task, one can easily set up a macro for the boilerplate BASH script.\nnnoremap bs i#!/bin/bash/<ESC>o\n\nOk that was p…",

In Angular, we have 3 fundamental ways to make to-and-fro binding between view and source.\nSource to View (one-way)\nView to Source (one-way)\nView to Source to View (two-way)\nThis refers to as Property binding method, it includes all following patterns to share data from source to view.\nInterpolation refers to embedding expressions into markup text. By default Angular interpolation uses {{ and }} to encapsulates the expression.\n<p>{{title}}</p>\n<div><img src=\"{{itemImageUrl}}\"></div>\n\nThe [] brackets cause Angular to consider right-hand side value as dynamic, without brackets Angular evaluates the right-hand value as static string.\n<img [src]=\"itemImageUrl\">\n<app-item-detail childItem=\"parentItem\"></app-item-detail> \n\n\nApart from element properties, we have element attributes ARIA and SVG for which we can use attribute bindings:\n<button [attr.aria-label]=\"actionName\">{{actionName}} with Aria</button>\n\nSingle class binding\n[class.sale]=\"onSale\"\n\nMultiple Class bindings\n[class]=\"'my-class-1 my-class-2 my-class-3'\"\n\nSingle style binding\n<nav [style.background-color]=\"expression\"></nav>\n\nMultiple styles binding\n<nav [style]=\"stylesExpression\"></nav>\n\nMore specifically, we call this Custom Event binding, utilizing Angular Event Emitter. \nConsider the following code showing button which alerts on click. The alert content is passed through <app-button> component template using custom event showMessage():\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  3. View to Source to View (two-way)\n\n\nAngular two-way data binding is the combination of square brackets [] and parentheses ().

But the really really cool thing about it is you can test your react components with the provider component to stub your dependencies:\n<Provider\n  onMount={(jpex) => {\n    jpex.constant<IDep>(mockValue);\n    // ev…",

          "description": "Data binding is the automatic synchronization of data between model and view. In Angular, we have 3 fundamental ways to make to-and-fro binding between view and source.\nSource to View (one-way)\nView to Source (one-way)\nView to Source to View (two-way)\nThis refers to as Property binding method, it includes all following patterns to share data from source to view.\nInterpolation refers to embedding expressions into markup text. By default Angular interpolation uses {{ and }} to encapsulates the expression.\n<p>{{title}}</p>\n<div><img src=\"{{itemImageUrl}}\"></div>\n\nThe [] brackets cause Angular to consider right-hand side value as dynamic, without brackets Angular evaluates the right-hand value as static string.\n<img [src]=\"itemImageUrl\">\n<app-item-detail childItem=\"parentItem\"></app-item-detail> \n\n\nApart from element properties, we have element attributes ARIA and SVG for which we can use attribute bindings:\n<button [attr.aria-label]=\"actionName\">{{actionName}} with Aria</button>\n\nSingle class binding\n[class.sale]=\"onSale\"\n\nMultiple Class bindings\n[class]=\"'my-class-1 my-class-2 my-class-3'\"\n\nSingle style binding\n<nav [style.background-color]=\"expression\"></nav>\n\nMultiple styles binding\n<nav [style]=\"stylesExpression\"></nav>\n\nMore specifically, we call this Custom Event binding, utilizing Angular Event Emitter. \nConsider the following code showing button which alerts on click. The alert content is passed through <app-button> component template using custom event showMessage():\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  3. View to Source to View (two-way)\n\n\nAngular two-way data binding is the combination of square brackets [] and parentheses (). [()] refers to property binding followed by event binding.\n<app-sizer [(size)]=\"fontSize\"></app-sizer>\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, which methods you have already used or would love to use soon, or something else? And Why? Let me know in the comments section. 😃\nSee you again in another exciting article. Until then, happy coding! 💻",

          "description": "When you start learning TypeScript, you will come across two types - any and unknown.\nany - The any type allows us to assign literally “any” particular value to that variable, simulating what we know as plain JavaScript.\nunknown -  The unknown type is the type-safe counterpart of any. Anything is assignable to unknown, but unknown isn't assignable to anything but itself and any without a type assertion or a control flow based narrowing.\nErrghh... Let's understand with an example.\nlet age: number;\nlet userAge: any;\n\nuserAge = 'This is some age';\nuserAge = 20;\n\nage = userAge;\n\nAnd yes, This code works! 🎉 Type of userAge is any so it can be assigned any value - string, number etc.\nlet age: number;\nlet userAge: unknown;\n\nuserAge = 'This is some age';\nuserAge = 20;\n\nage = userAge;\n\nThe statement age=userAge gives an error. I mean, the type is unknown so what is the problem here? To assign an unknown value to a value with a fixed type, we have to do some quick type check!\nlet age: number;\nlet userAge: unknown;\n\nuserAge = 'This is some age';\nuserAge = 20;\n\nif(typeof userAge === 'number') {\n  age = userAge;\n}\n\nAnd now this works too! 🎉\nWhen to use what? 🤔\nunknown is a better choice if you know what you want to do with that value eventually. \nI hope you learnt at least something.

If you structure your apps like me you end up with terribly long paths to import other components. Auto-import can take care of that for you automatically, but isn't it hard to read and let's be honest, very, very error prone?\nOne way to solve this issue is adding webpack aliases. Now if you created your application using the create-react-app cli, you will notice that there isn't a webpack config to mess with unless you eject it running npm run eject, which will expose the entire configuration and makes you responsible of maintaining it. I prefer not ejecting my react application because I prefer the ease of use using react-scripts, so there must be another way.\nCreate React App Configuration Overri…",
