The barcode you produce is valid everywhere and when you read it with a barcode reader, it shows the data you entered. It is a very practical and fast way to encrypt or organize products.\nAny data you convert to barcode will be valid everywhere. You can scan and save them with the barcode reader and organize the products in a shop.\nIn addition, you can use your passwords or data that you do not want anyone to see by converting them to barcodes.\nIt is not risky to make this conversion on the website. Because it is completely coded with vanilla JS. Since there is no database or registration network, you can use it with peace of mind. \nAlso, your comments and interest are very important to me. I look forward to your feedback.\nTake care and don't forget to fork :)\nGithub\nPreview",

You can check this logged in information with a simple command you will enter into the terminal. But there is a trick in that, will explain in next lines hereunder. Open your Terminal.app you'll find out in Finder in the section Applications and Utilities. For more informations check official Terminal User Guide.\nBy entering uptime command you'll be informed in one line output about the current time, number of days your system is up, number of logged-in users etc.\nuptime\n\nIf you'll enter this very same command into the terminal in capital form as UPTIME, you'll receive a more readable summary of the logged-in sessions by the user.\nUPTIME\n\nThe same output can be given by entering w command into the terminal.\nw\n\nDo remember you will always have a minimum of 2 logged-in users.

The class function essentially builds a template from which we may later create objects. When a new instance of the class is created, the constructor method is invoked.\nES5 ES6\nWhat is the difference between let and const? What distinguishes both from var?\nWhen declaring any variable in JavaScript, we used the var keyword. Var is a function scoped keyword. Within a function, we can access the variable. When we need to create a new scope, we wrap the code in a function.\nBoth let and const have block scope. If you use these keywords to declare a variable, it will only exist within the innermost block that surrounds them. If you declare a variable with let inside a block (for example, if a condition or a for-loop), it can only be accessed within that block.\nThe variables declared with the let keyword are mutable, which means that their values can be changed. It's akin to the var keyword, but with the added benefit of block scoping. The variables declared with the const keyword are block-scoped and immutable. When variables are declared with the const keyword, their value cannot be modified or reassigned.\nIn ES6, arrow functions are introduced. The shorthand syntax for writing ES6 functions is arrow functions. The arrow function's definition consists of parameters, followed by an arrow (=>), and the function's body.\nThe 'fat arrow' function is another name for the Arrow function. We won't be able to employ them as constructors.\nconst function_name = (arg_1, arg_2, arg_3, ...) => {\n\n    //body of the function\n\n} \nIt reduces the size of the code.\nhttps://bhylu.com/interview-questions/es6-interview-questions-and-answers/",

Last time, it happened to me a few days ago when I was to inspect the content of a base64-encoded string. The tool to the rescue is (of course not limited to) xxd. 🏅\nUsing xxd, to get the HEX representation for some binary content you just need to call it with no argument:\necho -n 'Computer says: \"Hello World!\"' | xxd\n\nDepending on the case it could be more insightful to also have the ASCII values column. That’s simply done by calling xxd with -C option:\necho -n 'Computer says: \"Hello World!\"' | xxd -C\n\nWhich results in such a neat output:\n00000000: 436f 6d70 7574 6572 2073 6179 733a 2022 Computer says: \"\n00000010: 4865 6c6c 6f20 576f 726c 6421 22 Hello World!\"\n\nAlso, xxd can do things the other way. For instance, may you need to turn a HEX string into a binary content, just call xxd with -r option, like this:\necho -n \"0x48656c6c6f20576f726c6421\" | xxd -r\n\nWhich would result in:\nHello World!\n\nThere are more xxd options which you can find by checking:\nxxd --help\n\nor\nman xxd\n\nAbout Regular Encounters\n\nI’ve decided to record my daily encounters with professional issues on a somewhat regular basis. Not all of them are equally important/unique/intricate, but are indeed practical, real, and of course, textually minimal.",

          "description": "I struggled with this concept a lot, but let me save you the stress, and explain as simply as I can.\nTypescript is just a secure way of writing JavaScript code. Do not get confused by the fancy terminologies people throw around it.\nThe good news is, if you know JavaScript, you already know ~90% of Typescript. The additional layer only forces you to be a lot more intentional about your variables and data types.\n...\nSimple answer? To catch errors early in your editor. \n...\nlet id = 1\nlet company = \"GYRO Design Lab\"\nlet isPublished = true\nlet mandem = [\"Dexter\", \"Mide\", \"Emmy\"]\n\n\nBut the unfortunate thing here is that, at some point later in your code, the variable company - for instance, could be re-assigned to a value of an entirely different data type, which would be unexpected behavior. \n…",

It gives more context to what developers were trying to achieve when they wrote their code, and allow us to do some cool things to boot. Here, we'll take a quick look at pipeline operators, how they work, and how you can use them today.\nCurrently, no browser or server side ECMAScript implementation (like Node.JS) support pipeline operators. You can, however, get them to work using Babel 7.15. You can learn more about installing Babel here, but suffice to say this will allow you to add pipeline operators into your code.\nPipeline operators are simply another way to manipulate values in Javascript.

This article assumes basic knowledge of Tailwind.\nFirst of all, let's add @layer to your index.css file in src folder. We create masonry layout class for 3 different screen;\n.masonry         (1 column)\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n@layer utilities {\n    @variants responsive {\n        .masonry {\n            column-gap: 1.5em;\n            column-count: 1;\n        }\n        .masonry-sm {\n            column-gap: 1.5em;\n            column-count: 2;\n        }\n        .masonry-md {\n            column-gap: 1.5em;\n            column-count: 3;\n        }\n        .break-inside {\n            break-inside: avoid;\n        }\n\n    }\n}\n\nNow you can use these classes as standard TailwindCSS feature. You should use them inside parent div.\n<div className=\"masonry sm:masonry-sm md:masonry-md\">\n\n  <div className=\"rounded-lg bg-gray-500 p-4 break-inside\">\n    <p> lorem100 </p>\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"rounded-lg bg-gray-500 p-4 break-inside\">\n    <p> lorem150 </p>\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"rounded-lg bg-gray-500 p-4 break-inside\">\n    <p> lorem50 </p>\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"rounded-lg bg-gray-500 p-4 break- inside\">\n    <p> lorem200 </p>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n\nThat is all.

We'll also have the need for early warnings about errors due to trying to access fields that don't exist or assuming different types from what they really are. These are good indications that you would derive a lot of benefit from using a type-checking system such as TypeScript. This article will look into how to make the transition from JavaScript to TypeScript in an existing project.\nTypeScript-support for Node.js is provided by the typescript NPM package.
