It is built on JavaScript.\nHowever, it doesn't have so much frameworks out there that gives you all the basics (boring) stuff off the box. Basics includes things like setting up server, folder structure, authentication, mailers and so on.\nJust incase you are new to Nodejs, I have a few courses you might want to checkout:\nSetting Up a Simple, Secure and Robust Node JS Server\nCRUD APP with Nodejs, Cloudinary, PostgreSQL and Heroku\nDocker - An introduction with Nodejs\nFull-Stack Authentication and Hosting (Nodejs, Reactjs, Heroku, Netlify)\nThese basics can be so tiring and consumes a lot of time.

          "description": "How we define our types in Typescript impacts how effective typescript is at warning us when we make mistakes. If we take a broad approach i.e. to cover many types in a single type, we end up handicapping typescript and it becomes less effective. \nThe more specific we are, the more effective typescript can be at catching possible errors. In this article, we are going to look at how we can use discriminative unions to write better and more specific types and help typescript to be more helpful to us.\nLet's take the simplest example I can think of - Shapes. In shapes, we can have Circles, Rectangles, Squares, etc; you get the idea. There is no way you can have a single type alias that can cover all shapes without compromising on something.\nIf we were to define a Shape type alias for just the ‚Ä¶",

          "description": "When starting in the world of cybersecurity/hacking, we always want to run and hack anything but it's important to know the basics. \nThe reason why you lock your house when you go out so no bad guy comes inside and steal your belongings is similar to why companies are so serious about information security, Spoiler alert: no one wants their personal belongings get stolen.\nInformation security means securing or protecting sensitive and important information as well as the systems that store this information from any unauthorized handling.\nInformation security consists of various important elements, we will first start with the CIA triad and later with the rest of elements. \nThe CIA triad consists of three important elements:\n\n\n\n1. Confidentiality(C)\n2. Integrity(I)\n3. Availability(A)\n\n\nNow, what do they mean?\nConfidentiality: Only those with authorized access will be able to access the information. Example: Encryption\n\nIntegrity: The assurance that the information/data haven't suffered any unauthorized modification. Example: Hashing\n\nAvailability: Data always been accessible for authorized users when required. Example: Backups, clustered machines\n\nNon-repudiation: Senders of a message can't deny having sent a message and the receivers can't deny having received it. Example: Digital Signatures\n\nAuthenticity: Guarantee of something being genuine. Example: Digital certificates,bio-metrics\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Why Information Security attacks happen?\n\n\n\nAttacks occur for a variety of reasons like attackers wanting to steal sensitive information, data disclosure, ransomware and many others. \nIt's important to understand the threats that a system may face to implement required preventive measures. \nYou can start learning and understanding the different hacking phases:\n1. Reconnaissance(Footprinting)\n2. Scanning\n3. Gaining access\n4. Maintaining access\n5. Clearing logs\n\nThanks for reading my first post! it may not be much but you start with something.",

          "description": "The OpenSSH 8.8 is now in the stable channel of Arch Linux and could reach other distributions any time soon.\nIn the release 8.7, the OpenSSH team announced that the ssh-rsa signature scheme will be disabled by default in the next version: 8.8.\nThe ssh-rsa signature scheme uses SHA-1 and it's sensible to chosen-prefix attacks.\nThis should not be a problem unless you are connecting to a server using the weak ssh-rsa public key algorithm for host authentication.\nüí° If you're using the version 8.7 or a previous one, you can test your remote hosts like a GitLab or a cloud server using:\nssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=-ssh-rsa user@host\n\nIf the connection fails, that means that the signature algorithm is not compatible with the default configuration of OpenSSH 8.8.\nIf you can't upgrade the signature algorithm on your remote servers but you still need to use them, you can use the following command:\nssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa user@host\n\nRight now, Bitbucket uses this weak signature algorithm, I guess you need to use your Git repositories hosted there. ü•∫ You can check your connection with the following command:\nssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa git@bitbucket.org\n\nHow can we enable this flag for all the Git commands? An easy solution is coming... You can create an SSH configuration file with the following content:\nHost bitbucket.org\n     HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa\n     IdentitiesOnly yes\n\nThe default location of this file is under ~/.ssh/config, maybe you already have one. Once you add this configuration value you can use any git command without restrictions.\nI hope this will help you to still SSHing the world üó∫Ô∏è",

(i.e. @Output() onThing: EventEmitter<string> will be mapped to prop onThing: (event: string) => void.\nTo use a React component in Angular, you'll have to do a tiny bit more work... for instance if you have a React component:\nfunction MyReactComponent(props: {\n  data: string;\n  dataChange: (evt: string) => void;\n}) {\n    // [...]\n}\n\n\nThen magically convert it to its Angular counterpart like that:\n@Directive({ selector: \"my-react-component\" })\nexport class MyReactComponent_Angular extends reactBridge.toAngular(\n  MyReactComponent\n) {\n\n  // a bit of extra work: You will have to map the properties yourself \n  @Input()\n  data!: string;\n  @Output()\n  dataChange = new EventEmitter();\n}\n\n(the Angular compiler doesnt allow to build dynamic components... so we have to declare them statically)\nJust inject Angular services in React like that:\nconst service = useService(MyAngularService);\n\nI'll write more about this when I have more time üëâ But please share your thought if you have some :) \nMore details on  the ngx-react repository",
