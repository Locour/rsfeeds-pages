          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

To build a real-time application like a chat application we can't use the basic request-response architecture, but we can use it with a polling mechanism to achieve the real-time behaviour. Apart from the polling mechanism we also have SSE(server-side event) and WebSocket to achieve real-time behaviour.\nIn this article, I am going to discuss two types of polling techniques i.e, long polling and short polling.\nFirst, we need to know, what is polling?\nPolling is a technique in which the client sends a request to the server asking for data in an interval of time.\nThe response from the server can be empty or any kind of data.\nShort Polling is a technique in which th…",

Nevertheless, it will only be possible over a significant period mainly because a large community depends on node js. At least for the time being, Node js isn’t going anywhere; Deno is only considered a fancy alternate choice.\nLearn more here: https://www.rlogical.com/blog/nodejs-vs-denojs-which-is-better-for-you/",

Sniffing of the file type would mean the browser modifying the Content-Type header that is returned from the server.\nSniffing the file content type could lead to non executable files being made executable, this could lead to bad actors injecting executable code into normal files and could lead to vulnerabilities.\nIt's best not to let the browser sniff the code.\nRecommended setting:\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\n\nYou can read about it more on Modzilla.\n\n\n\nThis header has mostly been superseeded by the Content Security Policy, however its still useful for old browsers.\nRecommended setting:\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n\nYou can read about it more on Modzilla.\n\n\n\nThis header has mostly been superseeded by the Content Security Policy, however its still useful for old browsers.\nThis indicates if the site can be loaded in a <frame>, <iframe>, <embed> or <object>.\nRecommended setting:\nX-Frame-Options: DENY\n\nYou can read about it more on Modzilla.\n\n\n\nIn summary, setting a few additional headers when serving up your site can really improve the security of your site. It reduces the amount of attack surface there is for attackers and prevent common attacks on websites.\nSet those headers now!\nHappy Building!",

You can switch to the terminal by pressing Alt+Ctrl+F1 to F12.\nYou can also start a graphical terminal. There are many variants like gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm, kitty and many others.\n\nThe Linux Command Line is …",

If you use a Unix-based operating system, such as Linux or macOS, you’re probably familiar with the shell, also called the command line. \nThe shell lets you interact with your system by entering commands that perform actions. When it comes to mastering the shell, there are a lot of possibilities for streamlining your work.\n\nLinux shells are a thing of beauty. They are the command line interfaces that power servers, minicomputers, supercomputers, embedded systems - and they are one of the most powerful tools in a system administrator's arsenal.\nA lot of tech professionals use the command line to do their job.\nLearning to use the Bash command line on a Linux-based operating system will change your life. It will save you hours of frustration and anger, level up your career, and improve your life in many other ways. If you want to practice the command line, I recommend this site\nServers\nIf you use a server or web server for your project, it most likely runs on Linux. You can connect to the server using ssh and control it using commands.\nssh user@ip\n\nThen login and you can control it with commands.\nSearch files\nThe power of the command line lies in its ability to perform tasks faster than you could with an interface alone. For example, if you want to find out where a file is located on your hard drive, you can use Nautilus/Dolphin (or Finder on a Mac) to locate it or just type one command:\nfind /home -type f -name filename.txt\n\nYou can also use the fd command\n> fd netfl\nSoftware/python/imdb-ratings/netflix-details.py\n\nNavigate file system\nYou can navigate the file system with the cd and ls commands. ls shows you the files in the current directory. cd changes the directory.\nSome commands include cd ~ go to home directory, cd dir enter directory, cd .. leave directory.\nThat's all you need to navigate your file system. Here you can find a large list of commands for Linux.",

          "description": "The following are my favorite tips and tricks for working with Vim. I use Vim as my primary editor, and try to avoid the use of other IDEs and editors.\nIf you're new to vim, or looking to learn more about the features already available, here's a sample of my tips and tricks.\nVim is often used by Linux but it works on every system. It's included by default on Mac OS X.\nIf you type / then a search term, Vim will start searching forwards from the current cursor location for that word. \nTo search for the next occurrence of that search term, press n (for next); to search backwards press N . After pressing n or N , Vim will highlight all matching words, which you can then press on to select.\n\nOne of the most powerful features of Vim is its ability to use ex commands. First, in order to run ex commands, you must be in insert mode: that is to say, not at the beginning of a line. \nIt’s important to note that in order to enter insert mode, you must first exit normal mode. To do this, press “i” or “a” – these keys will start you off in insert mode at the beginning of a new line or at the end of your current line.\nNow that you’re in insert mode, you can type “:” and then an ex command.\nSome things you can do are:\n:5p print the fifth line\n:100p print line 100\n:%s/hello/world/ search and replace\n:!bash return to bash, type exit to open vim\nThis saves you quit a few keystrokes. Press the number of times you want to repeat, then press the key. To move 100 lines down, press 100j. To move up 50 lines, press 50k. To delete 5 lines press 5dd etc.\n\nVim supports keyboard macros. They let you record and replay your keystrokes. This is really great if you have some tedious typing to do.\nTo start recording press q followed by a. To stop recording press the ESC key. Then press @ followed by a to replay the keystrokes.\nIf you are new to vim, I recommend this course",

          "description": "⌨️ Improve the User Experience (UX) of an e-commerce application by implementing animations utilizing Angular animations, CSS animations, and Web Animation APIs.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \nDevelopers can use animations in meaningful and non-distracting ways to significantly improve their application's user experience (UX). This blog post discusses four effective techniques to animate your application's user interface, covering popular use cases. You'll learn how to transform bland experiences into memorable ones for your users.\nI created a demo application to help you focus on adding animations to Angular. You'll add animations to a starter app as you progress through this tutorial. The starter application uses Tailwind to take care of its style and layout, but none of the animations discussed here are dependent on it.\nFollow this tutorial without cloning any repo, right in the browser using Stackblitz or CodeSandbox.\nIf you prefer to work locally in your IDE, clone the demo app and check out its starter branch:\ngit clone -b starter git@github.com:auth0-blog/angular-animations-storefront.git\n\nOnce you clone the repo, make angular-animations-storefront your current directory:\ncd angular-animations-storefront\n\nInstall the project's dependencies:\nnpm i\n\nRun the project locally:\nnpm run start\n\nAngular comes with a powerful animation module that lets you quickly add motion to your application: BrowserAnimationsModule. Under the hood, this module uses the Web Animations API (WAAPI) to create motion and interactivity. Whenever WAAPI isn't available, BrowserAnimationsModule falls back to using CSS keyframes. Angular animations give you the option to use their abstraction layer to animate any properties that the web considers animatable such as positions, sizes, colors, and many more.\nRead more...",

TypeScript experimental decorators were also incompatible with the Define semantics class fields, which caused a decent amount of breakage in the ecosystem.\n— The p is silent (@pzuraq\n) May 27, 2021\n \n\n\n\nWhen the proposal advances, figuring out a step-by-step incremental upgrade path for existing decorators users is definitely going to be a priority though! No user left behind 😄\n— The p is silent (@pzuraq\n) May 27, 2021\n \n\nLet's just hope that this doesn’t result in fragmentation of JavaScript decorators. We have already faced a lot inconvenience due to commonsjs and ES6 imports.",

          "description": "The Micro Frontend is one of the hottest topics on the internet right now. We hear it all the time, but what is micro Frontend? Imagine a website with lots of components such as Navbar, Footer, Main Container and Side Menu. What would happen, if they were being served from different domains? Yes, you guessed it right we would've ended up with a micro Frontend. Now, thanks to micro frontend technologies, we can deal with those apps separately. We can write their unit tests separately, e2e tests separately we can even use different frameworks like Angular, Vue and Svelte.\nThere are two major players to make those things happen right now, one of them is Module Federation and another one is Single SPA which I covered here: 🔗Migrating CRA to Micro Frontends with Single SPA.\nUnlike Single SPA, …",
