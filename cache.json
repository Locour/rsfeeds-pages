The second step was to translate those hand sketches into a digital version that gave me a representation of what the final project would look like on a mobile device. Figma and its community-built tools made that process relatively easy. Now I have some solid reference points for beginning the actual development process.

Pada tutorial ini kita akan belajar tentang bagaimana cara mengaktifkan GZIP di Nginx untuk mengkompres konten ataupun data, hal ini akan mengurangi ukuran konten yang dikirim ke pengunjung website sehingga proses penyajian konten menjadi lebih cepat, dan juga meningkatkan kinerja dari website tersebut.\nUntuk dapat mengaktifkan kompresi GZIP di Nginx, Kamu membutuhkan modul dari Nginx yaitu ngx_http_gzip_module. Modul ini akan mengkompres semua respons HTTP (file) yang valid menggunakan metode GZIP. Modul ini berguna untuk mengurangi ukuran transfer data dan mempercepat halaman web untuk aset statis seperti JavaScript, file CSS, dan lainnya.\nBaca Juga : Cara Konfigurasi HTTPS Nginx di Ubuntu\nEdit file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf atau …",

It is awesome, let's see how the guard implemented:\n@Injectable()\nexport class LogoutGuard implements CanActivate {\n  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {\n  }\n\n  canActivate(): UrlTree {\n    this.store.dispatch(logout());\n    return this.router.createUrlTree(['auth', 'login']);\n  }\n}\n\nThat's it!\nThe canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!\nAfter this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.\nThank you for reading 🙏🏽\nHope you liked ☕",

By doing this, our content is ready to be served when needed without any delay. There are many ways of doing this, I'll be touching upon some of the ways to do this in Angular and how we can create our own custom preloading strategy based on the user's network state.\nAngular provides us with route-based preloading out of the box. There are two strategies namely PreloadAllModules and NoPreloading.\nNoPreloading, as the name suggests does not preload any modules. This is the default behaviour.\nPreloadAllModules, on the other hand, preloads all modules. A simple example adding a preloading strategy in a routing module file can be seen below\napp.routing.module.ts\n \nIn the above code, t…",

He apparently had figured out some creative npx commands.\nI wanted something simpler for him.\nKnowing he had NodeJS installed, we set the path to the Angular CLI and made a custom shortcut to the NodeJS Command Prompt.\nWe followed the rabbit hole and found the Angular CLI in the following location ...\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\@angular\\cli\n\nThen, we opened the Environment Variables and added this to the Path. This ensures that we are able to reference the CLI in the command prompt later.\n\n\nThen, we located the NodeJS Command Prompt shortcut ...\nC:\\Program Files\\nodejs\n\nWe then copied the shortcut and placed it on the desktop to make things a bit easier.\nThe biggest change we made to the shortcut was to set the \"Start In\" folder to the root of his projects folder ... we got to these settings by Right-Clicking and selecting Properties.\n\nThis simple setup gave him much more flexibility without any hassles for Angular development using the CLI.",

          "description": "While TypeScript is a godsend for React developers, its syntax is fairly intimidating to newcomers. I think generics are a big part of that: they look weird, their purpose isn't obvious, and they can be quite hard to parse.\nThis article aims to help you understand and demystify TypeScript generics in general, and their application to React in particular. They aren't that complex: if you understand functions, then generics aren't that far off.\nTo understand generics, we'll first start by comparing a standard TypeScript type to a JavaScript object.\n// a JavaScript object\nconst user = {\n  name: 'John',\n  status: 'online',\n};\n\n// and its TypeScript type\ntype User = {\n  name: string;\n  status: string;\n};\n\nAs you can see, very close. The main difference is that in JavaScript you care about the v…",

          "description": "We all agreed about not manipulating data inside component or better to say presentation layer.\nSo I decided to put logout logic inside guard, this way I will be able to just call logout route and done!\nFor this I've configured my authentication module routes like this:\n{\n    path: 'login',\n    component: AuthComponent,\n    data: { registering: false }\n  },\n  {\n    path: 'register',\n    component: AuthComponent,\n    data: { registering: true }\n  },\n  {\n    path: 'logout',\n    component: AuthComponent,\n    data: { registering: false },\n    canActivate: [LogoutGuard]\n  }\n\nI love to keep things as simple and low as possible 😁\nFor log out I've added canActivate field and passed the LogoutGuard, the guards have the ability to return UrlTree. It is awesome, let's see how the guard implemented:\n@Injectable()\nexport class LogoutGuard implements CanActivate {\n  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {\n  }\n\n  canActivate(): UrlTree {\n    this.store.dispatch(logout());\n    return this.router.createUrlTree(['auth', 'login']);\n  }\n}\n\nThat's it!\nThe canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!\nAfter this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.\nThank you for reading 🙏🏽\nHope you liked ☕",

          "description": "Introduction\n\n\nPreloading is great. It lets us fetch parts of our application before it is even requested for. By doing this, our content is ready to be served when needed without any delay. There are many ways of doing this, I'll be touching upon some of the ways to do this in Angular and how we can create our own custom preloading strategy based on the user's network state.\nAngular provides us with route-based preloading out of the box. There are two strategies namely PreloadAllModules and NoPreloading.\nNoPreloading, as the name suggests does not preload any modules. This is the default behaviour.\nPreloadAllModules, on the other hand, preloads all modules. A simple example adding a preloading strategy in a routing module file can be seen below\napp.routing.module.ts\n \nIn the above code, t…",
