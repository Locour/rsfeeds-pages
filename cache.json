The difference between them is how they manage those symlinks. If you know the correct version of Node for the project you are currently working on, you can use nvm to set it to the active version, and all is well, as long as you remember to do so. The problem here is that you need to know the correct version of Node. And if you're switching from a project that has different Node version requirements, you have to remember to switch each time you open one of those projects.

To easily manage different versions of node and easily switch between then our go to one is nvm.\nNow, if you are using M1 Mac and have installed nvm then you might have faced an issue where using the command nvm install 14 is failed to install the desired node version (or any other version).\nThis can be bit daunting and you can solve this with following steps:\nInstall Rosetta 2 from the command line with:\n\n\n\n\nsoftwareupdate --install-rosetta\n\nGo to applications and right-click on iTerm app\n\n\n\nClick the checkbox for Open using Rosetta\n\n\n\nNow, re-open iTerm app\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Install desired node version\n\n\n\nNow, you should be able to install any desired version. For example to install node version 14 then we can use the following command:\n\n\n\n\nnvm install 14",

Should I use the ID token or the access token? ​🤔 The ID token looks nicer to me. After all, if I know who the user is, I can make better authorization decisions, right?\"\nHave you ever found yourself making similar arguments? Choices based on your intuition may sound good, but what looks intuitive is not always correct. In the case of ID and access tokens, they have clear and well-defined purposes, so you should use them based on that. Using the wrong token can result in your solution being insecure.\n\"What changes after all? They are just tokens. I can use them as I see fit. What’s the worst that could happen?\"\nLet’s take a closer look at these two types of tokens to better understand their role in authentication and authorization processes.\nAn ID token is an artifact that proves that the user has been authenticated. It was introduced by OpenID Connect (OIDC), an open standard for authentication used by many identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and, of course, Auth0. Check out this document for more details on OpenID Connect. Let's take a quick look at the problem OIDC wants to resolve.\nConsider the following diagram:\n\nHere, a user with their browser authenticates against an OpenID provider and gets access to a web application. The result of that authentication process based on OpenID Connect is the ID token, which is passed to the application as proof that the user has been authenticated.\nThis provides a very basic idea of what an ID token is: proof of the user's authentication. Let’s see some other details.\nAn ID token is encoded as a JSON Web Token (JWT), a standard format that allows your application to easily inspect its content, and make sure it comes from the expected issuer and that no one else changed it. If you want to learn more about JWTs, check out The JWT Handbook.\nRead more...",

Going pack to the zeroth post in this series, I am shocked at how far the community has pushed Android OS to become a desktop replacement OS.\nSome of this work was undertaken by corporations. This is most clearly shown by Samsung Dex, a desktop skin of Android that is installed on most of Samsung's latest devices. It is still Android under the hood, and it isn't perfect either, but it provides a basic, Chromebook-Esque interface to Android. This software package is partly the reason why I chose the Samsung Galaxy S7 Tab as well.\nThe two apps to start developing in a Linux container on Android OS are:\nTermux\nAndroidNix\nTo be honest, you don't need AndroidNix to get this working, but it cer…",

It is not referenced by any other code, it is not imported, it is not used in the final build in any way.\nRefactoring a project to make certain types, methods, or properties obsolete without removing that obsolete code will create dead code. Changing the direction of a project, like choosing to use a different API or library can also produce dead code. On large projects with many different teams and shifting priorities, the occurrence of dead code is inevitable.\nThere are many reasons why you should delete dead code. There are many effects that dead code can have on a large project:\nDead code must be compiled, which slows down the compilation time. It …",

          "description": "The problem\n\n\nIn Javascript, arrays are without a doubt one of the most broadly used data structures. That's why we need as many built-in methods as possible to manipulate the arrays the way we want. Javascript evolves and almost every new ES specification brings us some new array methods making it easier and easier to work with arrays. One of my favorite new ones is Array.prototype.at which makes getting the last element of an array so simple!\nInstead of\nconst lastElement = array[array.length - 1]\n\nwe can do:\nconst lastElement = array.at(-1)\n\n\nThe problem with array methods is well known to every developer. The thing is, some array methods mutate the original array but some don't. I challenge you to guess if Array.prototype.slice mutates or not? And what about Array.prototype.splice? I ca…",

Oke, let's start with some introduction\n\n\nIf you ask someone why sometimes JS is so confusing, probably one of the reasons is var😩 declaration. \nThat was my experience too in 2017 when I had my first contact with JS. It was post-ES6(ES2015), which means the let and const were there. \n\"lucky me, var is history and now we live in a new era\" 🙌. Guess what happened? Yeah, I was hit by a var bug in the face. TKO 👊😵, not stand a chance.\nIt's true that with ES2015 we have great alternatives for declarations in let🔥 and const🔥, but it is also important to know how var works (and pray we do not go into it 🙏   ).\nNow, why are let and const such a great option?

You can check out the code in the github repo.\nEver wanted to reach out to your readers and notify about some updates. if yes, then this app has got you covered, it has Push Notification support.\nWant to know how many users log-in and out of your app. we have got you covered, Custom Analytics(basic).\nNote: You can add your own Analytics service provider, if \nApp has Guest login, save for later, and much more.\nCurrently there is no ad's in the app, So there is no revenue generated from this app.\nif you are an expo dev then you can add your own ad service.(if you want to)\nYep, its an open-source project.\nAt first everything that i have used is free but if u want to scale it up or your readers go crazy with the app. then you might have to pay (not to me but to Heroku or Firebase).\nYou can learn more about the app and its features here.\nThanks for reading. hope you like it.
