There's a global crypto object that's available on the global self property. You can use that to generate a UUID like this:\nself.crypto.randomUUID();\n\nThe UUID it generates is a v4 UUID per the spec and ends up with a string that looks something like this:\n\"0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d\"\n\n\nYou want to do the same thing in node?

These IAM policies are designed for use with the AWS Web Console and therefore have more permissions to more services than most applications need access to. Instead, please create your own IAM policies for DynamoDB.\nIn order to follow least privilege security conventions, it is best practice to create your own custom IAM policy for DynamoDB access by an application. If this is something you have never done before, don't be intimidated. I got ya. To get you started, here are a few templates I created to use to enable full access to only Amazon DynamoDB table resources. \nOnce you play with these templates, you should ultimately create a new policy that narrows access down to just the operations the app needs to do on the resources it needs to do it. If all you are doing is SELECT and INSERT with the PartiQL API for DynamoDB on one table, then the only actions you should allow are these two:\n\"dynamodb:PartiQLInsert\"\n\"dynamodb:PartiQLSelect\"\nIn summary, use security best practices when designing access to Amazon DynamoDB for your apps, create your own customer managed IAM policies and do not use the AWS managed IAM policies.",

          "description": "Disclaimer: This is my first time using Vim (actually Neovim 😎), so by no means am I an expert.\nThis article was really helpful while configuring Neovim on my machine.\nVim is basically a text editor for Unix. It's similar to other programs like Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text Editor or Atom.\nSo what led me to Vim\n\n\nI love new challenges and improving my productivity. VS code was pretty customized and suitable for my current needs. Maybe YouTube videos from this guy (DistroTube) was the motivation to try it out. \nEfficiency: Vim is designed to reduce how often switch from your keyboard to a mouse. They are literally keybinding for any type of operation and you can create custom keybindings too. If you type really fast, this will improve your productivity as you will really need your mouse.\nLearning Curve: Vim has quite a learning curve if you're just starting. For the first few days, my focus was shifted majorly from the code I write to the tool I use. This is going to pay off later by building up muscle memory you will be able to exit Vim in your sleep.\nA quick meme about exiting vim:\n\nConclusion\n\n\nI will continue sharing my learning experience and journey with Vim for the next few months\nWhatever editor, language or framework you use, they should be able to solve your problems effectively and efficiently. \nNeovim and it's simpler and maintained. \nDo you think it is worth the time to learn Vim?",

In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware.

Getting a system up and running is as easy as logging into a cloud portal and clicking a few buttons. \nThe problem with not knowing about operating systems is; regardless how much abstraction there is, systems are still needed.

Therefore, one does not has to work upfront with DOM or Data Object Model. Instead of that, it goes for a Virtual DOM layer. It updates only those parts of the actual DOM which is needed to update. This escalates the development speed in React instead of Angular. \nMoreover, the Virtual DOM is one of the best features to have as it resolves the issues associated with cross-browser.\nThe developers also get access to a unified API of cross-browser that runs even on old browser versions. Such excellent performance of React has made everyone not hire AngularJS developers and opt for ReactJS developers as it is becoming more and more popular than Angular.\n2. JSX…",

We can get something like this.\n\nThe most interesting part about this is if we get enough sticks we can draw anything we want!\nYou can try it yourself here. Just draw a closed (that's pretty important) shape and press 'Start'.\nThis is based on a thing caller Fourier Transform. Basically, every complex function on a set interval can be represented as an infinite sum of exponents:\nf(t)=∑n=−inf⁡inf⁡cnen2πit,0≤t≤1\nf(t) = \\sum_{n=-\\inf}^{\\inf}c_n e^{n 2 \\pi i t}, \n0 \\le t \\le 1\nf(t)=n=−inf∑inf​cn​en2πit,0≤t≤1\n\n\n\nWhere\ncn=∫01f(t)e−n2πit\nc_n = \\int_0^1 f(t) e^{-n 2 \\pi i t}\ncn​=∫01​f(t)e−n2πit\n\n\n\nBut if we look closer we may notice that every element of that sum is actually a rotating vector Cn. So if we manage to represent a shape as a complex function, we could find these vectors (maybe not all, since there is infinite number of them, but we don't need all) and that would mean drawing the shape just by rotating those vectors!\nI made a video where I tried to explain this in more detail and code it in TypeScript.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy!",
