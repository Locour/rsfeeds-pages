          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

When your overall project is composed of multiple projects, it is tempting to create one Git repository per project. In Node.js, a project translates to a package. However, managing too many closely related repositories is confusing and time-consuming.\nPlacing multiple projects inside a single Git repository and using a tool like Lerna to facilitate their management worth the effort. This architecture is called a monorepo. It simplifies the versioning and publishing of the components as well as their manipulation and development.\nAt Adaltas, we have been developing and maintaining several monorepos for a couple of years.

We'll use the npm package node-rate-limiter-flexible to count and limit the number of login attempts by key. Each key will have a points value that will count the number of failed login attempts. The keys will expire after a set amount of time. The key-value pairs will be stored in Redis, which is an open-source in-memory data structure store. It has many different use cases.

First, you have to choose one out of many request libraries in the ecosystem. Second, they each have a slightly different API which is confusing when you're switching.\nYou also have to make sure the request is formatted in a specific way for the 3rd party on the receiving end to accept it.\nJust as you're starting to get the hand of axios, you soon find out there are (subtle) usage differences depending on whether you're in the browser or Node.js.\nWhat a pain.\nOnly if sending files with axios in Node.js would be as easy as taking a walk in the park.\nWell, it can be.\nIn this article, you'll learn how to se…",

Let's have a look at the various ways we can achieve this:\nThis method is used for the browser environments. Large web applications require many external modules.

So, in this post let's get rid of it and push it on Heroku.\nHeroku bestow the functionality to make a Node app a Worker which would run continuously as opposed to a Web app that would be put to sleep if not visited for a brief period of time.\nStep-0: Make a Heroku app, then we can deploy the app using either Heroku CLI or attaching Github to it. Here, I am gonna use Heroku CLI.\nStep-1: Add a Procfile to make our app a Worker. Simply make a file with the name Procfile add it to the root and add the following code in it:\nworker: npm start\n\nAnd modify the start script to \"start\": \"node bot.js\"\nStep-2: Push the app to heroku by following the steps: \nInstall Git form here\n\nInstall Heroku CLI from here\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Commit your changes using Git\n\n\n\n\n  cd myapp\n  git init\n  Initialized empty Git repository in .git/\n  git add .\n  git commit -m \"My first commit\"\n\n\nThen create a Heroku app using heroku create twitter-bot-2021, this would also add a remote to you repository. Check the remote using git remote -v. This should show a Herko remote.\n\n\nNow open the app by login in to the Heroku in order to put environment variables there as we cannot push .env file for security reasons.\n\n\nGet the app URL by opening up the app using open app option from inside the app dashboard.\n\n\nThen go to settings and click on Reveal Config Vars and insert the environment variables present in your .env file.\n\n\nNow, finally deploy the code to Heroku using git push heroku master:main, if you are on the main branch in your local git repo then simply do git push heroku main.\n\n\nCheckout these docs related to deployment in case you are stuck somewhere. \n\n\nCheck the dashboard of the app, it should show a successful build in green.\n\n\nNow, finally check the bot by following it form some other account, you should get the DM from the bot.\n\nAnd you have done it.",

Often you need a team to make it happen. Technology is changing at an incredible rate, so you need to get serious about adopting a methodology too.\nThere’s risks and rewards and, like everything else, you celebrate the wins and learn from the mistakes.\nBut one of the things experienced in all areas of software development, from business owners to junior developers and everyone in between, is the nagging, gut-wrenching feeling of uncertainty.\nSometimes it hits you in a coding sprint or maybe in the middle of a planning meeting.

When your overall project is composed of multiple projects, it is tempting to create one Git repository per project. In Node.js, a project translates to a package. However, managing too many closely related repositories is confusing and time-consuming.\nPlacing multiple projects inside a single Git repository and using a tool like Lerna to facilitate their management worth the effort. This architecture is called a monorepo. It simplifies the versioning and publishing of the components as well as their manipulation and development.\nAt Adaltas, we have been developing and maintaining several monorepos for a couple of years.

These services and/or layers can be web service APIs, database systems, cache proxy servers, serverless functions, etc. Communication between these elements is done by sending data in the form of messages from one point to another, oftentimes asynchronously. In this post, we will look at one of the tools that helps broker messages between the layers and services in these architectures and ensure that messages are transferred at a rate that can be handled by the intended destination service/layer.\nA message queue is a component in a system's architecture that helps buffer and distribute asynchronous requests.

As per nginx.com: \nNginx is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.\nSo in short, Nginx is a web server that has many capabilities in serving the content on server to the users.\nYou have to check that the server you want to install Nginx on is properly configured before proceeding so you can install and configure Nginx without any future issues.

In my first computer science class in high school we used Visual Studio.\nWhen I finally migrated to Linux, I started using vi/vim after using nano for a while. Unlike nano, vim is a lot more powerful but is harder to learn.\nHow did I go from never using vim to using it all the time? How does one make a complete switch? I'll walk you through how I got here and share some tips along the way.\nIf you are trying to learn Vim, or you are on the fence about it, here are my top 5 reasons why I love this keyboard-centered editor:\nThe more I used it, the faster I became, and the faster I became the more productive I was.\n\n\nIt's everywhere. Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and every other operating system supports Vi/Vim. \n\n\nI don't like to use my mouse. I never did anything in Sublime Text without the help of my mouse. This is a annoying, easier to keep hands on the keyboard\n\n\nIt can be used over the network using ssh. Login to any box and use it.\n\n\nI use it for almost everything: programming, writing, blogging, etc.\n\n\n\n\nSwitching is up to you, but here are my reasons.\nWhy would somebody use ancient tools like vi/vim when there are so many modern ones out there? \nOne day I had to answer this question for my friend. He asked, “Why don’t you use Sublime Text like me?” I explain to him that sometimes it’s better to use older/simpler tools than more complex ones.\nHere are my reasons:\nLearn how to use the best editor ever made.\nNever get lost in a sea of menus and toolbars that you never use (just like vim does not have any).\nHave an excuse to use powerful, built-in commands that are available in no other editor (and are faster than anything you can do with a GUI).\nWork fast using commands\nTo practice vim, you can use this site",

Three reasons.\nFirst, tmux is written is responsive and light.\nSecond, tmux is much more expressive than screen.

Just make sure you are using the right installer for your distribution/OS\nBy the way, Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6 (>=2.28) or libc6 (>=2.29) is referred to as the same problem\nOK, Let me explain a bit further,  A few months ago I was wanted to install VirtualBox on my Linux Mint computer, So, I went to the VirtualBox Official website (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads) but I won't found the installer for Linux Mint Version there ( It's still not present here as you can see in the picture below)\n\nSo, I choose  Ubuntu 19.10 / 20.04 / 20.10 / 21.04 from the available list because I knew Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu. so, whatever works on Ubuntu should be work on Linux Mint as well. It was not a big deal. But in the installation, it just won't worked and threw this Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6 (>=2.28) error.\n\nAt that moment I reconsider my OS. I was using Linux Mint 19.3 Cinnamon. OS version placed a critical role here. I simply Googled \"Linux Mint 19.3 Ubuntu Version\"  and found Mint 19.3 is based on Ubuntu 18.04 . \nI revisit the download page and download it again but now from the  Ubuntu 18.04 / 18.10 / 19.04  option and run the installer and Guess what, It was running absolutely fine without any issue. Through the installer required some extra dependency, not an issue, just allowed it\n\nMaybe you downloaded the Debian 10 version installer, not working.. then download it for Debian 9. Fedora 33/34 not working... download it for Fedora 32. Just make sure that the VirtualBox installer is compatible with your OS version :)\nShare your thoughts if you find something more interesting...\nWatch on YouTube\n\n\nThanks for reading.
