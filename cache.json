          "description": "Several months ago I was new to React.  As an experienced developer of classic javascript, one of the most objectionable things about the newer thick client frameworks such as React and Angular is the need to build the client side application to see changes. Let's face it, we are used to only having to refresh the browser page.  Fortunately for us the community has has helped us out with this issue, specifically the Create React App community.\n1) Node.js, React, and Webpack are watching your code and transpiling it - It's no secret that React delivered to the browser is quite different than what you wrote. Your tsx code has to be changed to jsx and your jsx code has to be changed to javascript, and this javascript has to be packed up for delivery to the browser.  Since you don't feel like doing this on your own some automation is in order, fortunately you will not have to think about this, just know that it is happening.\n2) A socket has been created on the browser back to the server - This is where the real magic is because by creating a socket with the server, communication can be pushed to the browser instead of having the browser poll the server, which would be far more messy.  So everytime you change your code, the chain reaction described in step one happens and then a message is sent up the socket to tell the browser to refresh the page.\nThere is a really interesting wrinkle to step 2.  If you load your page and then fire up your DOM inspector you will not see this socket, which is super confusing.  However, if you force a refresh of your browser page with the inspector open you will then see the socket.  A bug perhaps in Chrome?\nSo there it is, a peak behind the curtain.  Happy coding.\nFor more information on the latest frameworks, check out this article Common Frameworks for 2022.",

          "description": "You are logged into your system. In this case, it's macOS. You are facing just a simple question. Are you the only one who is logged in? I would like to give you an answer to this simple question with a bit of explanation. Here in upcoming lines, there will be a bit of theory background behind it.\nIn case your system is healthy (understand as an official system with applied updates), you are the only physical user logged in. You can check this logged in information with a simple command you will enter into the terminal. But there is a trick in that, will explain in next lines hereunder. Open your Terminal.app you'll find out in Finder in the section Applications and Utilities. For more informations check official Terminal User Guide.\nBy entering uptime command you'll be informed in one line output about the current time, number of days your system is up, number of logged-in users etc.\nuptime\n\nIf you'll enter this very same command into the terminal in capital form as UPTIME, you'll receive a more readable summary of the logged-in sessions by the user.\nUPTIME\n\nThe same output can be given by entering w command into the terminal.\nw\n\nDo remember you will always have a minimum of 2 logged-in users. By default when you open another terminal session it will be counted as another active user logged in. In other words, if you open four-terminal sessions, you will see 4 users logged in +1 as the default logged-in user I have written about.",

          "description": "I’m absolutely thrilled about Lacework’s newest announcement—we just acquired Soluble, a startup whose mission is to help security and operations teams leverage IaC to scale cloud operations and security for businesses of all sizes. I’m especially excited about what Lacework’s incorporation of the Soluble technology means for devs like yourselves. There are countless benefits, but these are the three that I’m looking forward to the most.  \nIaC is quickly becoming the primary mechanism to manage cloud infrastructure at scale. This shift increases both velocity and risk—to keep up, security and development teams need to quickly address the resulting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Integrating the Soluble technology into Lacework’s platform and teaming with Soluble’s experts prepares us to shift further left into developer workflows. \nLacework can directly and quickly reach developer audiences. Soluble helps Lacework make security issues easier to solve by correlating cloud misconfigurations to IaC and enabling remediation at the source via pull requests. This expands Lacework’s platform to the places where developers are writing their code: directly in the UX/CLI/GitHub and GitLab. For developers to integrate with Lacework, they simply need to connect through Git. \nSoluble shares Lacework’s vision to build a modern, data-driven approach to cloud security. Implementing Soluble’s capabilities to the Lacework platform helps security and operations teams shift further left and partner with developers so they can manage applications and infrastructure efficiently, securely, and reliably.\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on this acquisition in the comments below👇.",

          "description": "Why Python packaging can be hard\n\n\nThere may be a time in your development career where you need to author a package that extends Python w/ C or C++. In such a case your Python package needs to go through a compilation process, which converts C or C++ to binaries that work for a specific target system. This becomes really tedious when you think about how many flavors and versions of Linux there are.  Building a separate binary for Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, etc... Ugh so tiring.\nWhy Python packaging can be easy w/ manylinux\n\n\nFortunately, there is a solution. manylinux was birthed to make it easy for your Python packages to be compatible with most Linux variants. manylinux takes advantage of the fact that most distributions are mindful of backwards compatibility, and intentionally builds bdist wheels on an old version of a distribution. The idea is that if we build on an old supported version, the binaries produced are compatible with current versions.\nSo what is a manylinux really? Is it a ham sandwich?\n\n\nNo. Even better. It's a Docker image. manylinux is a Docker image built off a certain old versions of the CentOS operating system that comes bundled with libraries that are assumed to be present by default on almost all Linux systems.\nYou can find an example of manylinux distributions within the pandas project. Here are two (out of many) from the list of available pandas downloads from PyPI:\npandas-1.0.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl\npandas-1.0.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_i686.whl\n\nIn this case, pandas has built manylinux wheels for CPython 3.7 supporting both x86-64 and i686 architectures. It's manylinux so this wheel should be compatible for many linux :)\nHappy packaging!",

Basically it binds the target event name (click) to a method from the component (doSomething).\nAs explained in this nice article , Angular doesn't have a list of it's own event names, but it actually uses the names of the underlying DOM events.\nSo the event binding part of the <button (click)=\"doSomething()\">Do it</button> snippet is the equivalent of this vanilla snippet:\nelement.addEventListener('click', () => { doSomething() });\n\n\nThis means the if I want to know which events I can bind to in Angular I can search them here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events\nWhat about the $event?\nIf the event is a DOM event, like click, mouseenter, keyup etc then the $event is the event itself.

The process is seamless because of how the transferable data is handled.\nAs a user, when you access any application, you do so to retrieve information. This information is made up of data that must be stored somewhere; this is where serialization comes in.\nBy the end of this article, you should be able to understand how data transfers from one location to another, what format it transfers in, and the possible options for storing data streams. We’ll also cover technical issues that can arise when working with serialization in TypeScript.\nSo what is serialization and deserializati…",

So you add a custom workaround that validates the data in the input field.\nThen, you think \"I want to disable the submit button when the form is submitting\".

Writing automated tests with Cypress is no exception. With that being said, adding Typescript support to your Cypress applications is easy peasy!\nCypress ships with official type declarations for TypeScript. This allows you to write your tests in TypeScript. The first thing we need to do is install the typescript dependency.\nyarn add --dev typescript\n\nNext we need to update our tsconfig.json file with the following configuration:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"lib\": [\"es5\", \"dom\"],\n    \"types\": [\"cypress\"]\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"**/*.ts\"]\n}\n\nFinally we need to rename all of our .spec.js integration files to .spec.ts. \nIf you are like me you've found the path to this point super simple! However, if your application is using Cypress's Custom Commands API your Cypress application is now angry.\n\nDon't worry this is easy to fix! Let's open the file that contains our custom commands (usually support/commands.ts). This file should contain all of your commands as well as a Cypress namespace with a Chainable Interface. It is in this Interface we will add a reference to our custom command(s).\ndeclare namespace Cypress {\n  interface Chainable<Subject> {\n    getBySel(selector: string): Chainable<Element>\n  }\n}\n\nCypress.Commands.add('getBySel', (selector: string, ...args: any[]): Cypress.CanReturnChainable => {\n  return cy.get(`[data-test=${selector}]`, ...args)\n})\n\nAnd voilà our Cypress application is happy and now has full support for Typescript!\nOur complete guide on adding Typescript support to your application\nTypescript Support Doc",
