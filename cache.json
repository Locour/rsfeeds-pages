          "description": "Stream data is very common in Nodejs. There is a module called Stream which provides an API for implementing the stream interface. Streams make for quite a handy abstraction, and there's a lot you can do with them - as an example, let's take a look at stream.pipe(), the method used to take a readable stream and connect it to a writeable stream.\nA very common use for stream.pipe() is file stream.\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\nlet readStream = fs.createReadStream(\"./myDataInput.txt\");\nlet writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(\"./myDataOutput.txt\");\n\nreadStream.pipe(writeStream);\n\nAbove is a simple example shows that we use pipe to transfer the data from the read stream to the write stream.\nHowever there is a problem when using the standard source.pipe(destination). Source will not be destroyed if the destination emits close or an error. You are not able to provide a callback to tell when then pipe has finished.\nTo solve this problem, we can use pipeline which introduced in Nodejs 10.x or later version. If you are using Nodejs 8.x or earlier, you can use pump.\nconst { pipeline } = require('stream');\nlet readStream = fs.createReadStream(\"./myDataInput.txt\");\nlet writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(\"./myDataOutput.txt\");\n\npipeline(readStream, writeStream, error => {\n   if (error) {\n      console.error(error);\n   } else {\n      console.info(\"Pipeline Successful\")\n   }\n});\n\n\nyou may also read Backpressuring in Streams which explains more detail on why you should use pipeline.",

Nice to know there are still people out there.\nThe reason for this post. I started a site that is a network for developers to seek & give advice over video chat. \nhttps://p-pl.com is the site\nFor instance, if you are an expert in React.js, you can have other people connect with you. You as an expert can also bill for your time. (Hourly rate)\nOr if you're seeking advice, you can search for and request to connect with other users that are online at that given moment. If they accept the call, you are immediately brought to the video chat portal to hash out your code issues or anything else.\nOnce the interaction ends, each user can rate eachother based on professionality, expertise etc. Think of it almost like an uber for information.\nYou as a user are ranked higher in the results based on your reviews as well as the meta data your provide in your profile.\nThis was a 2 1/2 year project and I just want it in the right hands. I will be posting tutorials later on how to use the site, core features etc.\nWhat I'm looking to do is build the network full of JavaScript developers so that the community is rich with support in this language. Eventually then to move on to other languages.",

So in this post, we're going to explore how to avoid being haunted by content you thought you deleted — but actually didn't. \nIf you're hosting a static website using AWS S3, one of the easiest ways to update your site is with the sync CLI command:\naws s3 sync <LocalPath> <S3Uri>\n\nWhether you're running the command manually or as part of a CI/CD pipeline, it's important to note that, by default, it will only add content.\nThis means that even if you intended to remove a page from your site and removed all links to it, the page could still be accessed by navigating to it directly.\n\nIn order to delete non-existing content using this command, you'll have to use the --delete flag.\naws s3 sync <LocalPath> <S3Uri> --delete\n\nJust be careful to only use the --delete flag when you actually want to delete content that isn't present in the source directory.\nIn general, it's a good idea to run S3 CLI commands with the --dryrun flag to show what actions would be performed without actually performing them.\naws s3 sync <LocalPath> <S3Uri> --delete --dryrun\n\nTo read more about this command and other available options, see the documentation.\nIf you liked this, you might also like some of my other posts.

I frequently end up with \"login failed for token-identified-principal\" after being connected for only a few minutes. This makes using Azure Data Studio an exercise in frustration, wondering what combination of operations will result in ADS just conking out on you until your token expires.\nAzure SQL doesn't support the standard T-SQL BACKUP and RESTORE commands, so getting a copy of your database for local development is somewhat challenging. The Azure Portal requires the AAD admin credentials, not something I want to give out to developers. Enter SqlPackage, which I have started preferring to both the Azure portal and ADS. SqlPackage for Linux is available at https://aka.ms/sqlpackage-linux.\nA first attempt at copying the database from Azure might look like this:\nsqlpackage /a:export /scs:\"Data Source=...Initial Catalog=...\" /ua:true /tid:\"mytenant.onmicrosoft.com\"\nIndeed, that's what I attempted. But UniversalAuthentication (required to authenticate with MFA) doesn't seem to work as expected on Linux. You would expect that a browser would be launched to login to the application (since MFA won't work without a browser). However, the command above doesn't work.\nLooking through the SqlPackage help, I see that there is a /AccessToken option. We can manually obtain an access token and use it to authenticate.

The goal of this service was to act as a middleware layer; that way, clients not written in Salesforce could retrieve and update contact data stored in Salesforce. This backend service implemented its own caching layer to provide a faster response time and also cut down on the number of times Salesforce needed to be called.\nIn “Leveraging Salesforce Using a Client Written In Svelte,” I introduced a simple client written in Svelte, which made it possible to update the Salesforce data using an inline editor—again, without actually using the Salesforce client.\nThe “Leveraging Salesforce Using a Client Written In…",

          "description": "If we use OnPush change detection strategy, immutability is helpful to ensure change detection works expectedly. \nOne of the way to enforce immutability is using Immutable.js. However, using Immutable.js is not really straightforward. It adds another layer instead of using JS object directly e.g\nconst apps = List([{ name: 'slack' }, { name: 'skype' }]);\napps.get(0); // { name: 'slack' }\n\nconst app = Map({ name: 'slack' });\nmap.get(\"name\"); // 'slack'\n\n// Using Record if we want to access property directly\nconst AppRecord = Record({\n    name: ''\n});\n\nclass App extends AppRecord {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n    }\n}\n\nconst newApp = new App({ name: 'slack' });\nnewApp.name; // 'slack'\n\nWe have to use get when using List and Map. Using Record could solve the issue, but if we have a very large object, using Record will be hard to maintain because we need to create each record per object and it's nested object.\nOther issue is about JS compatibility because it needs to use fromJS and toJS methods to convert from and to JS object. \nI'd say that I'm not a fan of that lib and it makes things more complicated. \nOther possible approach I'm thinking of: \nreadonly + ESLint immutable\n\n\nSince Angular using Typescript, let's use Readonly<T>, ReadonlyArray to enforce immutability. \nAlso add this no-mutation ESLint rule as extra protection https://github.com/jonaskello/eslint-plugin-functional/blob/master/docs/rules/immutable-data.md\nis there any better approach? \nThank you",

          "description": "When i first started approaching reactive programming and rxjs i struggled a little bit to understand how data flows throught observables, pipes, operators and so on. All i had to help me were marble diagrams, but they just helped increasing the headache.\nI wanted to create something that could help beginners approaching rxjs, while helping more experienced developers debug complex pipes. \nrx-debugger is born! \nGetting started with rx-debugger is super easy. All you have to do is patching source observable and using operators exported by the library. \nHere is an example:\nimport { rxDebugger, map, toArray } from 'rx-debugger';\nimport { of } from 'rxjs';\n\nrxDebugger(of(1, 2, 3))\n  .pipe(\n    map((item) => item * 2),\n    toArray()\n  )\n  .subscribe();\n\nDoing so, you will get following output nicely printed in the console:\n\nBy the way, rx-debugger supports way more options than just printing tables in the console. You can find all the options in the docs.\nrx-debugger is open source and hosted on GitHub. While being fully functional, it is in early stages of development, and any help or feedback would be appreciated!",

Before we get going though, we should spend a moment looking at what vanilla-extract is and why you might want to use in a project or at least try it out.\nvanilla-extract is a modern Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) preprocessor, which generates plain CSS stylesheets.  It is TypeScript friendly and leans on TypeScript to add some extra useful features.  You can create your style in TypeScript files which sit alongside your Svelte code and import the styles, adding them as classes to your components.  The way you use them is similar to CSS modules usage pattern.\nWe'll get a proper introduction shortly, but here's a sneak peak as a teaser.  Here we define some style in our index.c…",
