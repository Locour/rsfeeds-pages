In case you have no idea how big the application will reach in the early days, using an internal cache can save you a lot of deployment time.\nBut you have to pay attention to one thing, if your application grows fast or if you already have a good number of daily requests, I always recommend using an external source. This is because by storing data in your application's cache, you will increase your application's memory leaks.\nI know a lot of people who don't care about memory leaks, however, if your application consumes a lot of RAM, the system may interrupt the application's execution‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Our goal at Knock is to empower people to move freely. A large part of achieving that goal is to make real estate transactions as easy and seamless as possible for our customers. Real estate transactions are very complicated. Calling them a \"big ball of mud\" is being gracious. If we could sum up such transactions up in one image, it would be the image of Charlie Day explaining how a person named Pepe Silvia doesn't exist:\n\nFor us as an engineering team, this translates into a lot of complex business logic. And we want to do our best to make sure that logic is sound. If our logic is faulty it can lead to thousands of dollars of disappointment. We do not want that. Thus, we thoroughly test our code via unit testing.\nWe are in a growth stage at Knock so we are regularly bringing on new engineers. During this process we have learned that it can be difficult for new engineers to come to grips with our testing code base while at the same time recognizing the patterns and strategies used in our unit tests. As a result, we have started a new open repository that provides lessons for any engineer to learn from and reference. We think this repository fills a gap in the community and are thus making it available for anyone to reference and contribute to: https://github.com/knockaway/unit-test-patterns-and-strategies.\nHave we missed any patterns or strategies? We welcome pull requests to add more. And if you're looking to join a team that cares about the quality of their code, we're hiring!",

A great community and an easy to digest syntax. I‚Äôm pretty sure when you wrote your first program that worked on the browser you felt pretty badass. \nGoing on as you advance, from an absolute beginner to a beginner (lol), you probably start to get erky with the amount of extra software to run a server. Database management and server maintenance which comes with apache pretty much helps a lot in reducing the difficulty with setting up and maintaining a database. \nSo if you are a frontend developer looking to learn backend technologies, php might be a great start, but if you are conversant with JavaScript, to reduce the extra time spent learning new syntax, it might be better to stick with Nodejs. \nNodejs is a JavaScript framework that gives you more control in managing the backend of your web based application. \nI wish you the very best in your learning activity!",

It is not uncommon to have to wait 30 seconds or more before your application can begin serving traffic, which becomes a problem on platforms that scale down to zero waiting for incoming traffic and expect to quickly launch an application to process a request.\nQuarkus is a container native platform that addresses many of these performance issues, and in this blog post, we'll take a look at a simple Quarkus web application exposing a REST endpoint protected by Auth0.\nQuarkus has been designed to address the needs of serverless and container environments by reducing startup times and memory consumption. Perhaps the most exciting thing about Quarkus is its tight integration with GraalVM to allow applications to be compiled into native binaries.\nQuarkus integrates with a huge range of libraries, giving developers access to many familiar platforms and allowing for the migration of existing code bases. These libraries are selected or customized to run seamlessly on Quarkus and to be able to take advantage of native compilation.\nOf course, authentication is a central requirement of any modern web application, and Quarkus has out of the box support for OAuth, which in turn can be integrated into Auth0.\nRead more...",

The probability of being a victim of an attack or being exposed to a security vulnerability is proportional to the effort developers put into protecting the applications created i.e. in React Native against any attacks.\nBuilding a mobile app is not only about creating screens, making fancy animations and processing data from the API. One of the biggest challenges in the development process is security.

You can solve almost any array processing problem using the reduce method.\n\n\nThe reduce method allows for more general forms of array processing, and it's possible to show that both filter and map can be derived as special applications of reduce. The reduce method iterates over each item in an array and returns a single value (i.e. string, number, object, array). This is achieved via a callback function that is called on each iteration.\n\n\nBelow is an example using reduce on the users array to return the sum of all the users' ages.

To clarify, when we say \"undo a commit\", we mean remove that commit from our history, and revert to the point at which the files were staged (with the changes captured in the commit).\ngit reset --soft HEAD^\n\nTo break this down, HEAD refers to the current branch, and HEAD^ means one commit back, aka the \"parent commit\". The --soft here specifies that we should reset the branch (to point at that parent commit), but otherwise leave the files in the working directory and the index untouched.\nThis has the effect of undoing the commit, taking us back to just before we made it. Note that it leaves our changes staged in the index.\nWhile useful, this is a complex command to remember, so once again we can create an alias, mapping this operation to the intuitive \"uncommit\" alias name.\ngit config --global alias.uncommit 'reset --soft HEAD^'\n\nOccasionally we'll find that after making a round of changes, we realize that some of the changes are entirely unrelated to others. \ngit add ., but we then realize that we only want to commit two of the three files that are now staged.\ngit reset filename\n\nTo remove a particular file changes from working directory\ngit checkout filename\n\nTo remove all the changes from working directory\ngit checkout .\n\nNOTE This is one of the few dangerous operations in Git.

It had helped me understand more about software and  computers and also improved my workflow and speed up computing tasks in general and my love for the terminal keeps on reaching newer heights.\nI believe that Linux would be very interesting for those people who likes the DIY approach and since Windows 11 doesn't offer decent support for older hardware that can be one of the many reasons for you to change to a much more free and privacy respecting more secure and open operating system build by the people without business intentions (*not all though).\nDon't blindly switch to Linux when someone says so! It's not for everybody and I respect that. But for any of you interested in switching to full time Linux. Do watch this: linux-for-windows-users (The guy doing the video is not from a tech background!)\nDo check out my blog (some things have improved from the time of writing): reasons-i-switched-to-linux\nPS: Neither am I an activist nor trying to stir up any debate here Just the user!.

For that purpose you can leverage scripts (aka. Angular custom schematics) that will apply code modifications to fix the breaking changes directly in user's codebase - when running a command, i.e. ng update @my/lib@2.0.0.\nAll the migration scripts of schematics are declared in a json file, i.e. migrations.json. And each of them is assigned to specific version (so you can have different schematics for migration from 1.x to 2.0, and different from 2.x to 3.0).\nBut you might have multiple schematics targeted for the same version, i.e. 2.0.0. In case  the order of schematics matter, you need to be aware that they are executed always in the alphabetical order by the name. That's why we should care about the prefix convention in migrations.json declared in our lib, for example numbering -01-, -02-, ...:\n{\n  \"schematics\": {\n    \"migration-v2--01-components\": {\n      \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n      \"factory\": \"./2/component-migration#migrate\",\n      \"description\": \"Migrate components\"\n    },\n    \"migration-v2--02-services\": {\n      \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n      \"factory\": \"./2/services-migration#migrate\",\n      \"description\": \"Migrate services\"\n    },\n  }\n}\n\nTo proof it's not the order of keys in the JSON that determines the order, but the alphabetical order of the keys (migration-v2--01-components, migration-v2--02-services), see the GitHub @angular/cli source code - sorting schematics by name.",

When the competition is so high, you need to keep your application up to date or updated to meet the requirements of the users. Your application must be fast in terms of loading and moving from different sections, if users find it slow they will surely leave your application. \nYou need to develop such applications which can handle the multiple requests without sacrificing the user's experience. Let‚Äôs understand it by implementing Angular Resolver.\nWhat is Angular Resolver\nThe main aim of Angular Resolver is to  pre-fetching data when a user switches between one route to another. It will be a very smooth approach for user experience and it loads the data before the user navigates.\nIn our article, we also discussed the General Routing Flow v/s Angular Resolver Routing Flow, read article for more details.\nWe also mention why one should choose Angular Resolvers and what is Resolve Interface.\nLets understand the quick steps of Angular Resolver - How to Implement?\n1) Create a new Angular app\nIf you want to see the output and want to know more about Angular Resolver, read our original article.",

The client application (such as an Angular SPA), obtains a JWT access token from the authentication server using one of the pre-defined OAuth flows.

You fire up your IDE and write down something like this:\ntype A = { s: string };\ntype B = { n: number };\ntype C = { b: boolean };\n\ntype MyObject = Record<string, A | B | C>;\n\nGreat, you can now type check your object literals:\nconst o1: MyObject = {\n  a: { s: 1 }, // error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.\n};\n\n// all good\nconst o2: MyObject = {\n  a: { s: \"str\" },\n};\n\nOpen in TS playground ‚Üí\nSome time later you decide that you need to know the type of o.a, but it can't be inferred!
