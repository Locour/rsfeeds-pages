          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

I can post all the design considerations here and will receive feedbacks which will help me (and maybe other people) a lot.\nThe problem is that I cannot think of any ideas about software/applications that are not only practical but also useful for real-life use cases.

          "description": "In this short article, we are going to see how we can handle error in JavaScript in Golang style.\nI am assuming, you have some experience with JavaScript and you are aware of the issues with error handling like throwing an exception to the parent method from try-catch block or chaining multiple then-blocks and implementing logic inside it. These things can easily mess up with the code making it difficult to read.\nGolang avoids these type of problems by handling errors/exceptions atomically.\nresult, err := methodCall()\nif err != nil {\n  // handle error\n}\n// do something with the result\n\nWe can use a similar pattern in JavaScript with the help of a try-catch block like this.\nconst getData = async () => {\n  try {\n    const result = await methodCall();\n    return [result, null];\n  } catch(error) {\n    return [null, error];\n  }\n}\n\nIf any error occurs, we are returning the error in the second position of the array and the result as null in the first position.\nIf there is no error, we are returning the result in the first position and error as null in the second position.\nNow we can call the getData method then handle the result and error like this.\nconst [result, error] = await getData();\nif (error !== null) {\n  // handle the error\n}\n// do something with the result\n\nThis pattern of error handling makes it very easy to read and understand the code.\nLet me know what do you think about this pattern.\nOriginally published on blog.bibekkakati.me\nThank you for reading 🙏\nIf you enjoyed this article or found it helpful, give it a thumbs-up 👍\nFeel free to connect 👋\nTwitter | Instagram | LinkedIn\nIf you like my work and want to support it, you can do it here.

Not necessarily tech, you can just read on and understand what I am rambling on about.\nSo, the current opentelemetry sentry-exporter is indeed incomplete right now. I investigated the elastic APM exporter and realised that Sentry one is just not using it's full capabilities yet. You need to run span.Events() to get a list of events which can be further converted into *sentry.Event.\n\n\nAlso, in the prometheus-operator helm chart, we figured out how to add additional rules without having to \"upgrade the chart\" without putting in new values in values.yaml. Just create a new PrometheusRule object as a rule file and the ConfigMaps will auto grab it.\nPS: I am talking about this operator here : kube-prometheus\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Stuff I need to check out tomorrow? 📅\n\n\n\nHow do i link a sentry span and a sentry issue.\nTalk with team and refine the requirements because hell no, Sentry is not a logging platform (or I am an idiot)\nGet vaccinated ffs 😢\nIF I manage to pull this issue linking stuff off, I think I will contribute this to opentelemetry collector exporter. My first cloud native contribution might be on its way idk man.\nThanks for listening to the rant.\nUddeshya Singh,\nSigning off.",

In a broader sense, we need these because we want to avoid some kind of latency (or have an illusion of doing so) in the execution of regular programs.\nTo do this, we try to write code that doesn’t necessarily runs in order (non-sequential) and all this boils down to two different concepts — concurrency and parallelism.\nI came across concurrency when I was trying to download ~5000 images from the web.

The latest version, 2.2.5 uses an outdated WebKit engine, which could cause some new web technologies to not work in the greeter. Also, the Debian package is not working, a shame.\nLuckily, Antergos team were developing a 3.0.0 version, getting rid of WebKit and using the QtWebEngine, based on Chromium, with Python. So, I decided to update some things about this greeter based on this pre-release.\nWhither is the “new” tool that 3.0.0 would be using, developed by Antergos, allows to create web applications in a similar way to Electron.js, but in Python.\nSo, I’m here to introduce a new pre-release. You can install it from the GitHub Repository. Though, you need to install the whither sdk to run it.\nCommand line arguments support, such as —-help, —-theme, —-debug and others\nSome fixes with the LightDM API, as power functions didn’t work\nMan pages updated\nEvery local request is made through web-greeter:/ url scheme\nWebKit no longer here.

          "description": "I know in Windows, \"file extensions\", the part of a file name after the final period in the file name, are more than just part of the file name, they also act as metadata to tell Windows what kind of file the document should be treated as, and what apps to open them in (i.e. what apps are associated with those file types).\nHowever, I want to start moving to Linux (Ubuntu) which I installed on my PC a while back, so, I recently tried making a new file (\"extensionless\"), and I wanted to make it a different type, so I tested to see if that would work by testing by renaming it .go, so I could try to open it in VSCode like I normally would on WIndows.\nI look up multiple searches, involving how to change the file extension (only getting results using command line), and eventually coming over to a horrifying S.O. answer that horrified me, it gave me the info that \"extensions\" (file types) are determined by header.\nThere doesn't seem to be any way in the \"Files\" file manager for Ubuntu to change the header type.\n\nWhat I want is a program that can give me a simple GUI to edit the file type of a file so I can easily go between one or the other as needed/wanted.\nInfo:\nOS: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS\nWindowingSystem: X11\nGNOME: 3.36.8",

Modern-day developers are utilizing a blend of advanced technologies to get swifter and enhanced outcomes through their projects.\nIncreasing the use of MEAN Stack is one of the primary examples of this scenario. MEAN JS is utilized to craft robust and scalable web applications. Let’s explore what exactly is Mean Stack and how it can assist your business.\nWhat is the MEAN stack?\nMean stack is the compilation and synergy of technologies applied to build web applications. MEAN is used by several Web App Development Companies, and it precisely stands for “MongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js.”\nHow does Mean stack architecture work?\n\nThe Mean Stack Architecture works in five stages.\nStage 1: Angular as a client-side language is the foremost one to work on the client request.\nStage 2: The client request then goes into NodeJS being the JavaScript server-side language.\nStage 3: ExpressJS is then into the process and makes a database request.\nStage 4: Then MongoDB retrieves the data and sends the response to ExpressJS.\nStage 5: NodeJS returns the data to the AngularJS to showcase the outcomes, and in return, the data is taken back from the ExpressJS.\n20 reasons to use MEAN stack for web & mobile app development project\n1) Free & open-source stack\nIf you want to read more about all reasons then visit Why Use MEAN Stack for Web & Mobile App Development Project?",

For example, in an air-conditioner, the compressor is said to be coupled to the internal cooling refrigerant and cooling mechanism, since these components together make up the entirety of the cooling system.\nCoupling can be of two types: tight coupling and loose coupling. These refer to how a system would react …",

          "description": "I recently posted about @okikio/animate, a new Animation library that uses the Web Animation API (WAAPI) to create smooth, and highly performant animation.\n@okikio/animate - the animation library built using the Web Animation API (WAAPI)\nOkiki ・ May 26 ・ 11 min read\n#webdev\n        #typescript\n        #javascript\n        #webanimation\n      \nWell a major limitation of the Web Animation API and consequently @okikio/animate, was that it didn't support custom easing, this limitation is on the verge of being removed.\nBased on a comment by @jakearchibald\n on Github and an article by kirillvasiltsov\n#229\n    \n  \njakearchibald\n         commented on Jun 14, 2021\n      \nYeah, you can hack it with keyframes today, but it'd be nice if it could be could be used within keyframes. Something like linear-easing(0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1) or whatever would be enough.\nView on GitHub\n#229\n    \n  \njakearchibald\n         commented on Jun 15, 2021\n      \nHere's a little demo to test that https://static-misc-3.glitch.me/linear-easing/.\nCases like bounce are tricky due to sudden changes of direction, but 50 points seems to do well.\nView on GitHub\nUsing the fact that WAAPI allows for linear easing, I created a small function that generates a set of arrays that create custom easing effects like bounce, elastic, and spring. As of right now it builds on top of @okikio/animate but that isn't absolutely necessary, it just may not be as comfortable as using it with @okikio/animate. \nYou can view a demo below,\n\n\n\n\nAs of right now if I add this to the @okikio/animate library it will more than double the size of the library (Note: treeshaking the actual package @okikio/animate while custom easing isn't in use will cause it to excluded from the final build reducing the size down to ~5.79 KB).\nI'm not sure if I should make Custom Easing a separate package or build it directly into @okikio/animate, please tell me what you think in the comments below.",

I've got some topics in my mind but I cannot convey them into words. My writing is not good enough. So I'm thinking of implementing some real product while writing about it at a same time. I can post all the design considerations here and will receive feedbacks which will help me (and maybe other people) a lot.\nThe problem is that I cannot think of any ideas about software/applications that are not only practical but also useful for real-life use cases. Simple case studies are good but I'm afraid of that the readers will lose the interest. So any suggestion would be welcome and appreciate.\nThank you very much.",
