          "description": "I’m absolutely thrilled about Lacework’s newest announcement—we just acquired Soluble, a startup whose mission is to help security and operations teams leverage IaC to scale cloud operations and security for businesses of all sizes. I’m especially excited about what Lacework’s incorporation of the Soluble technology means for devs like yourselves. There are countless benefits, but these are the three that I’m looking forward to the most.  \nIaC is quickly becoming the primary mechanism to manage cloud infrastructure at scale. This shift increases both velocity and risk—to keep up, security and development teams need to quickly address the resulting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Integrating the Soluble technology into Lacework’s platform and teaming with Soluble’s experts prepares us to shift further left into developer workflows. \nLacework can directly and quickly reach developer audiences. Soluble helps Lacework make security issues easier to solve by correlating cloud misconfigurations to IaC and enabling remediation at the source via pull requests. This expands Lacework’s platform to the places where developers are writing their code: directly in the UX/CLI/GitHub and GitLab. For developers to integrate with Lacework, they simply need to connect through Git. \nSoluble shares Lacework’s vision to build a modern, data-driven approach to cloud security. Implementing Soluble’s capabilities to the Lacework platform helps security and operations teams shift further left and partner with developers so they can manage applications and infrastructure efficiently, securely, and reliably.\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on this acquisition in the comments below👇.",

          "description": "FreeCodeCamp states that if any component receives new state or new props, it re-renders itself and all its children. This is usually okay. But React provides a lifecycle method you can call when child components receive new state or props, and declare specifically if the components should update or not. The method is shouldComponentUpdate(), and it takes nextProps and nextState as parameters.\n\n\nYou can use shouldComponentUpdate() to prevent this by comparing the props. The method must return a boolean value that tells React whether or not to update the component. \n\n\nCode:\n\n\n\n\nclass OnlyEvens extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\n    console.log('Should I update?');\n    // Change code below this line\n    return true;\n    // Change code above this line\n  }\n  componentDidUpdate() {\n    console.log('Component re-rendered.');\n  }\n  render() {\n    return <h1>{this.props.value}</h1>;\n  }\n}\n\nclass Controller extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      value: 0\n    };\n    this.addValue = this.addValue.bind(this);\n  }\n  addValue() {\n    this.setState(state => ({\n      value: state.value + 1\n    }));\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <button onClick={this.addValue}>Add</button>\n        <OnlyEvens value={this.state.value} />\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n\n\nclass OnlyEvens extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\n    console.log('Should I update?');\n    // Change code below this line\n    if (nextProps.value % 2 === 0) {\n      return true\n    } else {\n      return false;\n    }\n    // Change code above this line\n  }\n\nYou click the Add button and watch the order of events in your browser's console as the lifecycle hooks are triggered.",

          "description": "Why Python packaging can be hard\n\n\nThere may be a time in your development career where you need to author a package that extends Python w/ C or C++. In such a case your Python package needs to go through a compilation process, which converts C or C++ to binaries that work for a specific target system. This becomes really tedious when you think about how many flavors and versions of Linux there are.  Building a separate binary for Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, etc... Ugh so tiring.\nWhy Python packaging can be easy w/ manylinux\n\n\nFortunately, there is a solution. manylinux was birthed to make it easy for your Python packages to be compatible with most Linux variants. manylinux takes advantage of the fact that most distributions are mindful of backwards compatibility, and intentionally builds bdist wheels on an old version of a distribution. The idea is that if we build on an old supported version, the binaries produced are compatible with current versions.\nSo what is a manylinux really? Is it a ham sandwich?\n\n\nNo. Even better. It's a Docker image. manylinux is a Docker image built off a certain old versions of the CentOS operating system that comes bundled with libraries that are assumed to be present by default on almost all Linux systems.\nYou can find an example of manylinux distributions within the pandas project. Here are two (out of many) from the list of available pandas downloads from PyPI:\npandas-1.0.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl\npandas-1.0.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_i686.whl\n\nIn this case, pandas has built manylinux wheels for CPython 3.7 supporting both x86-64 and i686 architectures. It's manylinux so this wheel should be compatible for many linux :)\nHappy packaging!",

          "description": "This blogpost is about a connectionpool that is lesser known than pgbouncer, which is pgagroal. Both are socalled 'external connectionpools', which mean they can serve application/user connections but are not part of an application. \nThey also serve the same function, which is to serve as a proxy between clients and applications on one side, and to a postgres instance on the other side. In that position, the first obvious advantage is that it can perform as an edge service, concentrating connections from one network, and proxy the requests to the database in a non-exposed network.\nAnother advantage is that the client/application side connections are decoupled from the database side connections, and therefore can serve badly behaving applications (which create and destroy connections to a d…",

Writing automated tests with Cypress is no exception. With that being said, adding Typescript support to your Cypress applications is easy peasy!\nCypress ships with official type declarations for TypeScript. This allows you to write your tests in TypeScript. The first thing we need to do is install the typescript dependency.\nyarn add --dev typescript\n\nNext we need to update our tsconfig.json file with the following configuration:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"lib\": [\"es5\", \"dom\"],\n    \"types\": [\"cypress\"]\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"**/*.ts\"]\n}\n\nFinally we need to rename all of our .spec.js integration files to .spec.ts. \nIf you are like me you've found the path to this point super simple! However, if your application is using Cypress's Custom Commands API your Cypress application is now angry.\n\nDon't worry this is easy to fix! Let's open the file that contains our custom commands (usually support/commands.ts). This file should contain all of your commands as well as a Cypress namespace with a Chainable Interface. It is in this Interface we will add a reference to our custom command(s).\ndeclare namespace Cypress {\n  interface Chainable<Subject> {\n    getBySel(selector: string): Chainable<Element>\n  }\n}\n\nCypress.Commands.add('getBySel', (selector: string, ...args: any[]): Cypress.CanReturnChainable => {\n  return cy.get(`[data-test=${selector}]`, ...args)\n})\n\nAnd voilà our Cypress application is happy and now has full support for Typescript!\nOur complete guide on adding Typescript support to your application\nTypescript Support Doc",

In this article, I want to show you the fastest way to create a content (some call it a dictionary) Service for your Angular application.\nIf you need a content service with multiple languages, I highly recommend NGX-Translate.
