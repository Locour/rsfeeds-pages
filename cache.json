          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

Yet a recent IBM/Ponemon Institute study found that only 36% of responding organizations require it. And adoption numbers for the general public aren’t encouraging either, with a report from LastPass finding that only 37% of respondents use MFA for their work accounts. When you add the finding by Verizon that 80% of data breaches involves the use of stolen credentials, these numbers beg the question, why?\nIf MFA has been proven so effective as a defense against data theft and brute force attacks, why are adoption numbers still so low?

You know which sources to trust when you are reading information on social media, yes, we are talking about verified accounts on social media. In-order to minimize the continuously exploding phishing frauds in the inbox, Certifying Authorities have taken an initiative to issue verified mark certificates for brands to show their brand logo in the email inbox.\nTo make this challenging task a reality Google announced full support for the movement. This functionality will use BIMI standards (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) to show the verification mark within email clients.\nBIMI provides a secure, global framework enabling email inboxes to display sender-designated logos for authenticated messages. It also includes protections to prevent senders from spoofing logos owned by other organizations\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of BIMI? \nBIMI offers several important benefits to end users as well as to marketers across the globe.\nBIMI can reduce the amount of phishing activities.\nIt offers improved email security by using existing email authentication technologies like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.\nProvides a great opportunity for every marketers email to get read first because of logo recall.\nBIMI increases the confidence in the mind of a recipient as they see a verified logo against the sender name.\nWhat are Verified Mark Certificates ?\nVerified Mark Certificate in Action\n\nHow to get Verified Mark Certificates?\nAs of now Google & the BIMI group has not rolled out any specific date of its implementation. As per Google the pilot testing has started and will be made live for all by the end of 2020. An organization would require getting VMCs to show BIMI standard logos.\nIn case you would like to register for BIMI and want numerous VMC then contact us.  We will get back to you with all the relevant details at the earliest.",

Traditional API monitoring sure does help you stay on top of uptime, security, and performance. Still, it is limited to being a black box form of monitoring – you’re only testing API behavior that you’d only see externally.

          "description": "Developers are always looking for simpler ways to do more advanced things in less time, and one of the many ways that they can achieve this is by using a selection of tools to supplement their workflow. The aim of this article is to cover some of the major tools that people use, and to give you an insight into what they can do to make your life easier.\nAnd to seal the deal, all the tools I’ll be mentioning are completely free to use, which is an incredible price for what you’re getting from them.\nGit / Version Control\nGit is the most well-known version control tool out there. It allows you to store your code on a server (thereby reducing data-loss risks), collaborate with other developers and share your code online. Another huge plus to Git is that it allows you to go and look at other people’s public repositories, and see how they solved certain problems. This can then help you solve the problem in your application, and it can save you lots of time and effort.\nGit is open-source itself and it comes with a huge selection of extensions that allow you to modify the functionality of the system in a huge range of different ways.\nThe fact that Git allows you to go back and review previous versions of your code, see how it’s changed and keep track of issues as well as provide you with lots of automation tools makes it quite clear that Git, or a Git alternative is a must-have for nearly every project.\nWhilst you could install a system like Gitea on a VPS and then run your own Git server, there is a selection of different services out there that provide Git repository hosting as a service. These services often come with lots of extras too, and usually a very generous free tier. The most notable Git host out there is definitely GitHub, but it is closely rivalled by GitLab among other solutions.\nWant to read more?

So I installed Debian in the way we usually do install Arch.\n\n\n\n\nAll this learning had to be documented somewhere so I created another video talking about the process in a little bit of detail.\nMoving to Debian meant re-setting up the entire machine, even deeper than what I had to do back when I moved the factory-installed Windows to a smaller partition to make space for my primary Linux partition.\n\n\n\n\nThe new setup took away a few issues I never got fixed, and in exchange, brought with it a few other ones. I talked about the similarities, differences, negatives, and most importantly, the positives of the migration in a separate video, adding another episode to my series Back to Linux.\nAs I did last time, I'll keep my eyes open for ways to improve my setup and workflow, and will keep documenting my learning to be able to share them with the rest of the community.\nNeedless to say, I'm loving the alternate universe with Debian. Do throw in your ideas and thoughts in the comments and hopefully, we can learn something from each other.",

Let’s explore what exactly is Mean Stack and how it can assist your business.\nWhat is the MEAN stack?\nMean stack is the compilation and synergy of technologies applied to build web applications. MEAN is used by several Web App Development Companies, and it precisely stands for “MongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js.”\nHow does Mean stack architecture work?\n\nThe Mean Stack Architecture works in five stages.\nStage 1: Angular as a client-side language is the foremost one to work on the client request.\nStage 2: The client request then goes into NodeJS being the JavaScript server-side language.\nStage 3: ExpressJS is then into the process and makes a database request.\nStage 4: Then MongoDB retrieves the data and sends the response to ExpressJS.\nStage 5: NodeJS returns the data to the AngularJS to showcase the outcomes, and in return, the data is taken back from the ExpressJS.\n20 reasons to use MEAN stack for web & mobile app development project\n1) Free & open-source stack\nIf you want to read more about all reasons then visit Why Use MEAN Stack for Web & Mobile App Development Project?",

You might wonder what they hell are decorators and what they do? Decorators are an experimental feature of typescript and still remain subject to change. That being said, decorators are simply just a way to extend your class with meta data or annotate your code. Why on earth would you want to add some extra data of your own to your data? Well for sorting and grouping purposes. Decorators also allows us to achieve Behaviour Driven code. I think decorators are really cool, in most use cases for creating a decorator you will agree with me that it makes your life much easier to deal with and things are managed…",
