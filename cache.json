          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

He borrowed from several programming languages: Java (syntax, primitive values versus objects),\nJavaScript did not have exception handling until ECMAScript 3, which explains why the language so often automatically converts values and so often fails silently: it initially couldn’t throw exceptions.\nOn one hand, JavaScript has quirks and is missing quite a bit of functionality (blockscoped variables, modules, support for subclassing, etc.). On the other hand, it has several powerful features that allow you to work around these problems. In other languages, you learn language features. In JavaScript, you often learn patterns instead. Given its influences, it is no surprise that JavaScript enables a programming style that is a mixture of functional programming (higher-order functions; built-in map, reduce, etc.) and object-oriented programming (objects, inheritance).",

          "description": "Containerization of apps is a fast-growing practice as many companies are embracing the cloud and DevOps concepts. Docker packages an application, libraries, and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any server. Being that most applications do not run on one single component (even dinosaur apps 🦖 have frontend and backend components), we need a way to define and manage multi-container apps.\nIn this tutorial I will utilize Docker compose to get a blog up and running that consists of a Ghost Blog service and a MYSQL service; both services will use volumes for persistent storage. This tutorial assumes you have working knowledge of Docker and a server with Docker and Docker compose installed.\n\nCompose is a file format for describing distributed Docker apps, and it’s a tool for managing them.\nGhost is a free and open source blogging platform written in Javascript.\n1. SSH into the server and become root\nssh <username>@PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS\nsudo su -\nStep 2 — Create a Ghost Blog and MySQL service\n2. Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root directory\nvi docker-compose.yml\nAdd the following contents\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n  ghost:\n    image: ghost:1-alpine\n    container_name: ghost-blog\n    restart: always\n    ports:\n      - 80:2368\n    environment:\n      database__client: mysql\n      database__connection__host: mysql\n      database__connection__user: root\n      database__connection__password: P4sSw0rd0!\n      database__connection__database: ghost\n    volumes:\n      - ghost-volume:/var/lib/ghost\n    depends_on:\n      - mysql\n\n  mysql:\n    image: mysql:5.7\n    container_name: ghost-db\n    restart: always\n    environment:\n      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: P4sSw0rd0!\n    volumes:\n      - mysql-volume:/var/lib/mysql\n\nvolumes:\n  ghost-volume:\n  mysql-volume:\n\n3. docker-compose up -d\nCongrats your blog is up and running!

Here, I'll dig much deeper into the release notes.\nThe Angular team has been working on Ivy (the new compilation & rendering pipeline) since 2018. It was finally released with Angular 8. Since Angular 9, Ivy has been the default for new projects, and the ecosystem is slowly migrating to it. With Angular 12, the old View Engine is now officially deprecated. It will be removed in a future major release. Also, it won't be possible to create new applications using View Engine. Finally, Ivy…",

But the other 10% are actually when you hit falsy values, which might otherwise be perfectly valid.\nOne point you can usually see such code at is the beginning of functions that don't use default parameters, like seen here:\nconst myFunction = (parameter) => {\n  const cleanedParameter = parameter || 'a default value';\n// ... more code ...\n}\n\nIf you call it like this:\nmyFunction();\n\nor like this:\nmyFunction(null);\n\nit works perfectly fine.\nBut what if the following call was actually a valid one?\nmyFunction('');\n\nWell, the empty string is a falsy value and will thus be replaced with the default value. And this is where you hit the 10% where the logical OR doesn't help you anymore.\nThe nullish coalescing operator works nearly identical to the logical OR, but it only reacts to null and undefined. Instead of two pipes, you place two question marks, and it looks like below:\nconst result = a ?? b;\n\nIf you now replace the logical OR in your function with the nullish coalescing operator like this:\nconst myFunction = (parameter) => {\n  const cleanedParameter = parameter ?? 'a default value';\n// ... more code ...\n}\n\nmaking the same call with the empty string as before:\nmyFunction('');\n\nwill lead to the empty string being treated as a valid value again.\nNo matter what falsy value you pass from now on, be it the empty string, the number 0, or else, only null and undefined will be treated.\nIf you like visual content more, or if you want to store it for later, I put all this into one single image for you. I hope you like it!\n\nIf you would love to read even more content like this, feel free to visit me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\nI'd love to count you as my ever-growing group of awesome friends!",

It  works in many editors and supports many languages.\nBut opinionated code formatter is his best feature and the first reason to use it.\nWhen you begin with a new team, the first pain is define the style guide for the project. More the language is permissive, harder is the debate.\nWith Prettier, debate is closed, because most of the decisions are taken. He has few options, so it's easy to configure. All you need is a json file named .prettierrc.json.\nThat's mine, for example :\n{\n  \"useTabs\": false,\n  \"printWidth\": 90,\n  \"tabWidth\": 2,\n  \"singleQuote\": true,\n  \"jsxBracketSameLine\": false\n}\n\nIf you use Visual Studio Code, add the Prettier extension and enable format on save feature. Each time you save a file, Prettier will run and autoformat. It's convenient.\nIf you don't know what is a pre-commit or a post-commit, they're scripts which execute during the workflow of a commit with git.\nAll you need is define a precommit file like this one.\n#!/bin/sh\nFILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR \"*.js\" \"*.ts\" \"*.tsx\" \"*.scss\" | sed 's| |\\\\ |g')\n[ -z \"$FILES\" ] && exit 0\n\n# Prettify all selected files\necho \"$FILES\" | xargs ./node_modules/.bin/prettier --write\n\n# Add back the modified/prettified files to staging\necho \"$FILES\" | xargs git add\n\nexit 0\n\nThis file is for a TypeScript project with SCSS, so you can update file extensions to fit yours.\nIt's run Prettier and add updated files to staging.\nAnd a post commit to update index.\n#!/bin/sh\n\ngit update-index -g\n\nCreate a .githooks folder at the root of your project and put a pre-commit and  post-commit files inside with the content above.\nThe last commands to type is to tell git the folder of hooks and make them executable. Execute them in your terminal.\ngit config core.hooksPath .githooks\nchmod +x .githooks/*\n\nThis post is short but it's everything you need to work with Prettier.\nAnother tools exists to create hooks, like Husky.\nFollow me on Twitter",

Ok so it's right there, I made a hook what is the big deal? I thought to myself \"It took me forever to do this because of the overhead what if I removed that for others?\" So I did. \n\nTechnologies:\nTypeScript \nNPM/NPX \nOclif \nEnquirer\nSo it might come as a bit of a surprise but there are only 2 shell files in this whole CLI tool.

          "description": "An array is a common data structure that holds items of the same type, in Typescript, unlike other languages, an array doesn't have a fixed length. Also, in Typescript, you don't have to re-organize all elements of an array when makings operations like insert or delete.\n\nElements are the items stored in an array\nIndex is the location of an element in an array, it goes from 0 to (array length - 1)\n\n\n\n\n/** An array can be written like this **/\n\nconst numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nconst names = string[] = ['Snake', 'Ocelot', 'Otacon', 'Naomi']\n\n/** Also can be written using a generic array type, Array<elemType> **/\n\nlet list: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nlet list: Array<string> = ['Snake', 'Ocelot', 'Otacon', 'Naomi']\n\nTraverse - Print all array items one by one\n/** 3 ways to iterate an array **/\n\nfor(let i=0; i<array.length; i++) {\n    console.log(array[i])\n}\n\nfor(const item of array) {\n    console.log(item)\n}\n\narray.forEach(item => {\n    console.log(item)\n})\n\nInsertion - Add an item\n/** add to the end **/\narray.push(5)\n\n/** add to the beginning **/\narray.unshift(0)\n\n/** add in a specific index position **/\narray.splice(3, 0, 8) // add 8 in the index 3\n\nDeletion - Remove an item\n/** remove from the end **/\narray.pop()\n\n/** remove from the beginning **/\narray.shift()\n\n/** remove from a specific index position **/\narray.splice(2, 1) // remove from index 2\n\nUpdate - Update an item\n/** update element in position 1 **/\narray[1] = 7\n\nSearch - Search by an item\n/** you can traverse an array to find an element by its value, or simply use the .find() function **/\n\nconst item = array.find(item => item === 3) // search by an item with value 3\n\nAll above operations can be performed on strings to solve problems like count the occurrences of a character in a string:\nlet str = \"aabbccdd\"\nlet occurrences = 0\n\nfor(let i=0; i < str.length; i++) {\n    if(str[i] === \"c\") {\n        occurrences++\n    }\n}\n\nconsole.log(occurrences) // prints 2",

          "description": "Overall idea behind this article to explain and demonstrate the usage of ControlValueAccessor and Validator interfaces . The former is used to bind together a FormControl from Forms package and native DOM elements. The latter is used to implement validation logic. They can exist independently of each other, but in this article we’ll implement both using a single directive. Our directive will add the following functionality to the application:\nConversion between input value and control value\nValidation for invalid date\nIf you’re using ControlValueAccessor for the first time, I would recommend going through this article first: Never again be confused when implementing ControlValueAccessor in Angular forms. \nWe will first create a directive and handle conversion between UI and control value.\n…",
