          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

Perhaps you have an existing API server and you wish to enable it to serve some front end.\nThis type of set up is documented in NextJS itself: https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server\nIn the standard example, they use Node's http package; we'll use Express to take advantage of its middleware and routing capabilities.\nI've provided an example barebones integration at https://github.com/alexey-dc/nextjs_express_template\nLet's take a look at…",

Here is a hello world application in node:\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'));\napp.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server ready'));\n\nNow, if we run the node command for this file:\nnode index.js\n\nWe can visit our browser and see the website.\n\nHowever, if we now cancel this script, we won't be able to see the website anymore.\nInstead of running the node script, we can specify pm2 to start the script and even provide a useful name for this app.\npm2 start index.js --name=test\n\n\nOur terminal now is clean, so we can do other stuff, but looking at our website, it's back working again!\nNow that we have our script running, let's see some useful commands.\nThe first one might be stopping an instance for whatever reason.\ntest in this command is the name of the script.\npm2 stop test\n\n\nNow our website will give us a bad gateway again.\nAnother thing we can do is restart a node script. Let's say you made some changes to the file.\npm2 restart test\n\nThat restart will reboot the script and stop/start it.\n\nAnother great option is to list all instances running.\npm2 list\n\n\nAnd the last one I want to note is the log function. Sometimes you might have some issues where the app might be starting but stops immediately.\nThat's where the log function is mighty.\npm2 logs\n\n\nPM2 is a super powerful process manager for node scripts on Linux systems.\nFull documentation on PM2 website\nThank you for reading my blog.

It is frequently used to find problematic patterns or code that doesn’t adhere to certain style guidelines. ESLint is written using Node.js to provide a fast runtime environment and easy installation via npm.\nJavaScript, being a dynamic and loosely-typed language, is especially prone to developer error. ESLint lets you put guidelines over coding standard and helps you to minimize those errors. The main reason for imposing those guide is because every developer has her style of writing (like naming conventions/tabs/single or double quotes for a string).

I've got some topics in my mind but I cannot convey them into words. My writing is not good enough. So I'm thinking of implementing some real product while writing about it at a same time. I can post all the design considerations here and will receive feedbacks which will help me (and maybe other people) a lot.\nThe problem is that I cannot think of any ideas about software/applications that are not only practical but also useful for real-life use cases.

I created a couple of reusable artifacts and it in a way became a base for my second YouTube channel.\nThings kept breaking, and I found myself spending more time on fixing things than I expected, even with my prior experience with Linux before I spent four years on macOS.\n\n\n\n\nSo I started looking out for alternatives and found the exact thing I was looking for.\nI couldn't lose the control I had over my Linux setup back with Arch by delegating it to a graphical installer. So I installed Debian in the way we usually do install Arch.\n\n\n\n\nAll this learning had to be documented somewhere so I created another video talking about the process in a little bit of detail.\nMoving to Debian meant re-setting up the entire machine, even deeper than what I had to do back when I moved the factory-installed Windows to a smaller partition to make space for my primary Linux partition.\n\n\n\n\nThe new setup took away a few issues I never got fixed, and in exchange, brought with it a few other ones. I talked about the similarities, differences, negatives, and most importantly, the positives of the migration in a separate video, adding another episode to my series Back to Linux.\nAs I did last time, I'll keep my eyes open for ways to improve my setup and workflow, and will keep documenting my learning to be able to share them with the rest of the community.\nNeedless to say, I'm loving the alternate universe with Debian. Do throw in your ideas and thoughts in the comments and hopefully, we can learn something from each other.",

One of these greeters is the previously known as lightdm webkit2 greeter, then named lightdm web greeter, a greeter that allows theming with web technologies like HTML and JavaScript.\nSadly, this greeter was abandoned as Antergos team didn’t have time to develop their distro. The latest version, 2.2.5 uses an outdated WebKit engine, which could cause some new web technologies to not work in the greeter. Also, the Debian package is not working, a shame.\nLuckily, Antergos team were developing a 3.0.0 version, getting rid of WebKit and using the QtWebEngine, based on Chromium, with Python. So, I decided to update some things about this greeter based on this pre-release.\nWhither is the “new” tool that 3.0.0 would be using, developed by Antergos, allows to create web applications in a similar way to Electron.js, but in Python.\nSo, I’m here to introduce a new pre-release. You can install it from the GitHub Repository. Though, you need to install the whither sdk to run it.\nCommand line arguments support, such as —-help, —-theme, —-debug and others\nSome fixes with the LightDM API, as power functions didn’t work\nMan pages updated\nEvery local request is made through web-greeter:/ url scheme\nWebKit no longer here. Replaced with Chromium\nSome API changes. 2.2.5 deprecated functions and globals were removed\nIf you are using LightDM, I recommend you to use this greeter, try some themes and create your own!\nUse the Glorious theme by Manilarome~ It’s glorious.",

So bear with me 🙂.  I appreciate all feedback and constructive feedback is the most helpful.\nThroughout my career as a developer I have heard a lot of people agree that testing our code is something that we should all be doing. Conversely, I have not worked at many places that actually do it. Additionally, and surprisingly to me, rarely if ever do you see a tutorial show any kind of testing when they're trying to teach something unless they're specifically teaching testing.\nWhile I understand that the focus of the lesson may not be testing, I think that if we really want to see testing adopted more widely across our industry then we…",

Modern-day developers are utilizing a blend of advanced technologies to get swifter and enhanced outcomes through their projects.\nIncreasing the use of MEAN Stack is one of the primary examples of this scenario. MEAN JS is utilized to craft robust and scalable web applications. Let’s explore what exactly is Mean Stack and how it can assist your business.\nWhat is the MEAN stack?\nMean stack is the compilation and synergy of technologies applied to build web applications. MEAN is used by several Web App Development Companies, and it precisely stands for “MongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js.”\nHow does Mean stack architecture work?\n\nThe Mean Stack Architecture works in five stages.\nStage 1: Angular as a client-side language is the foremost one to work on the client request.\nStage 2: The client request then goes into NodeJS being the JavaScript server-side language.\nStage 3: ExpressJS is then into the process and makes a database request.\nStage 4: Then MongoDB retrieves the data and sends the response to ExpressJS.\nStage 5: NodeJS returns the data to the AngularJS to showcase the outcomes, and in return, the data is taken back from the ExpressJS.\n20 reasons to use MEAN stack for web & mobile app development project\n1) Free & open-source stack\nIf you want to read more about all reasons then visit Why Use MEAN Stack for Web & Mobile App Development Project?",

If anyone is interested, you can try it.\nEnglish, 简体中文\ni18next's typescript type definition generator can generate type definitions from multiple language translation json files, supporting nested objects and parameters.\nThe type definition generation of the international configuration of cli itself is also done by cli (bootstrapping)\nyarn add -D @liuli-util/i18next-dts-gen\ni18next-dts-gen gen --input src/i18n # Scan this directory for json files and generate index.d.ts type definitions\n\nDetail\n…",

This week, I refactored the codebase to use IOC everywhere, and it feels like I leveled up. 😄\nThere's been a lot of articles these past couple of years about \"functional programming\" in JavaScript, and for some reason these are mostly concerned with immutability, sets, map/reduce, and so on. I come from a background of mostly OOP, where the answer to IOC is largely just \"use constructors and interfaces\", so this hasn't been really helpful.\nWhat was missing for me, was a functional perspective on IOC and dependency injection.\nIn this article, I will try to illustrate the problems and solutions with a silly example for illustration purposes: for some reason, your b…",

          "description": "What is the dependency inversion principle?\n\n\nThe dependency inversion principle is one of the standard guiding rules of software design and development to ensure component extensibility and loosely-coupled components.\nSimply said, the dependency inversion principle states that we need to rely on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.\nSystem coupling is defined as the constraining state of one item to another item inside a system. Coupling occurs on context information. For example, in an air-conditioner, the compressor is said to be coupled to the internal cooling refrigerant and cooling mechanism, since these components together make up the entirety of the cooling system.\nCoupling can be of two types: tight coupling and loose coupling. These refer to how a system would react …",

          "description": "I recently posted about @okikio/animate, a new Animation library that uses the Web Animation API (WAAPI) to create smooth, and highly performant animation.\n@okikio/animate - the animation library built using the Web Animation API (WAAPI)\nOkiki ・ May 26 ・ 11 min read\n#webdev\n        #typescript\n        #javascript\n        #webanimation\n      \nWell a major limitation of the Web Animation API and consequently @okikio/animate, was that it didn't support custom easing, this limitation is on the verge of being removed.\nBased on a comment by @jakearchibald\n on Github and an article by kirillvasiltsov\n#229\n    \n  \njakearchibald\n         commented on Jun 14, 2021\n      \nYeah, you can hack it with keyframes today, but it'd be nice if it could be could be used within keyframes. Something like linear-easing(0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1) or whatever would be enough.\nView on GitHub\n#229\n    \n  \njakearchibald\n         commented on Jun 15, 2021\n      \nHere's a little demo to test that https://static-misc-3.glitch.me/linear-easing/.\nCases like bounce are tricky due to sudden changes of direction, but 50 points seems to do well.\nView on GitHub\nUsing the fact that WAAPI allows for linear easing, I created a small function that generates a set of arrays that create custom easing effects like bounce, elastic, and spring. As of right now it builds on top of @okikio/animate but that isn't absolutely necessary, it just may not be as comfortable as using it with @okikio/animate. \nYou can view a demo below,\n\n\n\n\nAs of right now if I add this to the @okikio/animate library it will more than double the size of the library (Note: treeshaking the actual package @okikio/animate while custom easing isn't in use will cause it to excluded from the final build reducing the size down to ~5.79 KB).\nI'm not sure if I should make Custom Easing a separate package or build it directly into @okikio/animate, please tell me what you think in the comments below.\nThis article also appeared on my blog, blog.okikio.dev.\nPhoto by Ellen Qin on Unsplash.",

I've got some topics in my mind but I cannot convey them into words. My writing is not good enough. So I'm thinking of implementing some real product while writing about it at a same time. I can post all the design considerations here and will receive feedbacks which will help me (and maybe other people) a lot.\nThe problem is that I cannot think of any ideas about software/applications that are not only practical but also useful for real-life use cases. Simple case studies are good but I'm afraid of that the readers will lose the interest. So any suggestion would be welcome and appreciate.\nThank you very much.",
