I’ve completed a full stack boot camp, followed dozens of tutorials, and built my own projects from scratch. As my skills have developed certain things have come into focus. Firstly, I know where my strengths lie; organizing code in a readable and maintainable codebase is a borderline obsession for me. I like small, modular components that keep individual files to a manageable size. React is a framework I have genuinely come to love. It has provided me with a much greater competency in “vanilla” JavaScript and a practical, consistent path to rendering my vision in the browser.

Enjoy :).\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  A tip from the video: snippets.\n\n\nFor some reason I was very reluctant to make my own snippets. A mean I used build-in ones, or the ones that come with extensions, but I never made my own. Until recently I was using css modules and I got really tired typing import for my styles.\nSo I decided to give it a shot. Turns out even if it does not save you tons of time, I mean typing is like 1% of programming, it surely makes you feel better. So I guess my advice is if you get annoyed about typing something over and over, consider turning that thing into a snippet.\nAnd here is that css modules snippet I was talking about for VS Code.\n{\n  \"Import css module\": \n  {\n    \"prefix\": \"mcss\",\n    \"body\": [\n      \"import styles from ./$TM_FILENAME_BASE.module.css'\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

          "description": "❓ What is CORS?\n\n\nCross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a “preflight” request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.\n\nThe solution to bypass CORS is to use a Proxy. A Proxy server, that forwards your request as it is.\nBut, problems with a Proxy Server is to manage the server, optimize the server, handle traffic, use of Kubernetes to minimize bills, and what n…",

In my case, I use a Raspberry Pi to backup things like RAW images from my camera to an off-site location. The extra security gives me a little peace of mind, especially as the server generally uses a cellular connection.\nI’ve been using UFW to work as a killswitch and only allow traffic via the VPN connection, but one issue I've had is with my trusted VPN provider is that they regularly rotate IP addresses. UFW uses iptables under the hood, meaning it can only be configured to use IP addresses explicitly and not a domain name. This has left my backup machine without an internet connection fairly frequently.\nJust to set this str…",

          "description": "Terraform is an IaC(infrastructure as Code) framework for managing and provisioning the infrastructure but have you ever thought of creating only a single terraform configuration file for managing the complete cloud infrastructure.\nWell, it sounds insane because if you only have a single file for managing the complete infrastructure then it will grow in complexity as well the line of configuration code will be manifold. That is why terraform introduced a concept of the module that will help you to organize your terraform configuration so that you can re-use the configuration and keep your terraform code more clean and more modular.\nIn this Lab session, we will create two modules module-1 and module-2. Inside each module, we will install the apache httpd server with each module is having its home page.\nSteps for Creating the module - \nCreate your first module\nModule structure\nCalling the module\nModule best practices\nBenefits of Modules\nTerraform Module instruction guide? - https://jhooq.com/terraform-module/",

          "description": "I'm not gonna talk about how does a DHCP server work exactly, \nIf one of the devices in the network is configured with a static IP address, when the DHCP server starts distributing the IP addresses to other machines, what happens exactly ? does it skip it ? or does it duplicate it and therefore there would be a conflict ? \nSo the answer is, NOPE the DHCP server will not distribute that IP address, you may be wondering, but how ?\nRemember that the DHCP server sends an ARP Broadcast asking about the IP address about to be distributed \n\"Who has x.x.x.x\"\nAt that moment the machine with that static IP address will respond with an ARP saying that it got that IP and that its MAC address is X:X:X:X:X:X so the DHCP server will continue to the next IP address asking \"Who has y.y.y.y\"\nBut here comes another problem, \nwhat if the local network is placed behind a router, and we all know that the routers doesn't allow broadcasting, then what happens ?\nwell simply instead of ARP Broadcasting, it uses ICMP Packet type 8 code 0 which is the ECHO request ( ping ) and if it gets no answer than it distributes it, else it simply continues to the next IP address.\nAnd here comes the last question, \nAnd what if a device that is configured with a static IP address was shutdown, and the DHCP distributed its IP address, what happens if the machine is up again?\nwell there are two solutions for this, some DHCP servers are advanced enough and caches the static IP address and therefore this conflict will never occurs, but if the DHCP server doesn't provide this feature, than it should be configured to exclude these IP addresses or else there will be an IP Duplication.\nAnd this pretty much sums up the main problems of dealing with a DHCP server.",

I have a simple component which only use content projection:\n@Component({\n  selector: \"adr-label\",\n  template: `<ng-content></ng-content>`,\n})\n_export class_ LabelComponent {}\n\nHere’s the associated story:\n_export default_ {\n  title: \"atoms/forms/label\",\n  component: LabelComponent,\n  decorators: [**componentWrapperDecorator** (LabelComponent)],\n} _as Meta_;\n\n_const_ BasicTemplate: _Story_<LabelComponent> = (args) => ({\n  moduleMetadata: { declarations: [InputDirective] },\n  **template** : `<adr-label>{{ ngContent }}</adr-label>`,\n  props: { ...args },\n});\n\n_export const_ Default = BasicTemplate.bind({});\nDefault.args = {\n  **ngContent** : \"Un label\",\n};\n\nThe specificity here is to use a componentWrapperDecorator. It allows to wrap our component and to pass it some extras like in my case a text content.\nYou just have to define a template like in BasicTemplate to emulate the content projection and using it like an input.\nIn the Default args, I add an ngContent arg to set the content of my label. I choose this name “ngContent” because it appears in the controls list and I find it consistent to let know that’s a content projection in this way.\nYou can see the result here:\nStorybook\nYou can access to the full code here:\natomic-design/src/components/atoms/forms/label at master · GaetanRdn/atomic-design\nStory for an Angular Directive\nLogger decorator\nInstall Jest for Angular\nAngular for everyone: All about it",

If there's any clarification needed because my question is not preicse enough I'll gladly provide!\nSo as part of my current education we're doing something they call pop-up internship where you go to visit a company for a day or two and run through a couple different departments to get a feel for how different companies might tackle some of the daily tasks they encounter.\nOne company in particular had an app in development that really got me interested. They were building a web application for one of their customers based on the Angular framework from what I understand. The backend/serverside code was written in Java. The interesting part is that they used some way to turn the expoted Java-WAR into a file they would include in the Angular project. This allowed them to call methods from that service and, what was the most interesting to me, the classes for the project were only defined in that Java code yet perfectly usable in that Angular code. I saw some kind of service URL in the code which I assume is somehow being used to make the actual calls in some way.\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to dig deep enough/get into the deeper questions I had regarding the whole procedure. \nI don't have any experience with Java, writing mostly little PHP and C# applications so far so I wondered - is a model like this possible to set up with Angular and PHP? If yes, where do I need to look in terms of guidance to set something like that up with my Angular project? What are some key things I need to know before tackling something like this? Is it even worth doing like that?\nThere's a lot floating in my head right now regarding this because this is kinda exciting to me, any and all help would be greatly appreciated",

Turns out even if it does not save you tons of time, I mean typing is like 1% of programming, it surely makes you feel better.

          "description": "TypeScript 4.1 has brought a nice feature called Template literal types. Many authors have written about it, so I won't stop here and explain how it works. Instead, I would like to show you an example of how we can use it. Let's not waste our time!\nEvery i18n module has a translate function (also can be named as short t). Assume that we have a function with such a signature:\ndeclare function translate(path: string, variables?: Record<string, string>): string;\n\nAs the first parameter, we can pass a dot delimited keys of a translation object. It can be a JSON object or JavaScript object, whatever. The main thing is that TypeScript can't check path correctness and possible variable existence in the translated sentence with such signature. Besides, you must be careful with what you are writing…",
