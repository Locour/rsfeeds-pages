Algolia is a flexible hosted search and discovery API that comes with a generous free community plan. It provides up to 10,000 search requests per month, pre-built UI libraries (which we‚Äôll use in this tutorial), natural language processing and many other features. What‚Äôs more, the engineers at Algolia are wonderfully helpful!

          "description": "With the introduction of CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) policy, frontend code won't have access to a response if correct CORS headers are not embedded in it. If you own the backend code, then it becomes easy to handle since you can just add the headers before sending the response. If it's not owned by you, then you have no way to add headers directly before the response reaches your frontend code. \n\nManually inserting them using GUI can be tiresome. The easiest way to get past this is to use a proxy server.\nCheck out this repo: add-cors\nIt includes a public proxy server which can be used to fetch data by adding CORS headers so that it's not blocked by CORS policy. A better way is to create your own proxy and use it without relying on a public server. The repo contains instructions on how to go about creating a proxy and host it on Heroku.\n   git clone https://github.com/das-jishu/add-cors.git\n   cd add-cors/\n   npm install\n   heroku create cors-everywhere //cors-everywhere is an example. Use a unique name for heroku to create.\n   git push heroku master\n\nThe code is fairly simple which enables someone to write it from scratch instead of cloning the code and add more features and utility as needed.",

Check out this article how to do it correctly.\nI am an open-source developer working on Databunker. Today I got a question from one of the guys on a social network.\nIt is totally true, you can go DIY. On the other hand, Databunker grew to be a better solution than you can think about.\nDatabunker is a special application server used for the secure storage of customer data. It is not a full-fledged database. In the backend, it is using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite to store encrypted customer records. The product comes with full GDPR compliance and is built with privacy-by-design architecture.\nAny company implementing Databunker has a quick and easy way for GDPR and privacy-by-design compliance in addition to much better security.\nHashicorp Vault is a great product. It is built for completely different use cases.\nFor example, when saving records in Databunker, Databunker knows to extract user email, phone, login identity, and custom identity and built a secure hashed-based index to do a quick user record lookup.\nUser record CRUD is just a part of the service. In Databunker, you have a secure session storage API, temp shareable identities API, automatic record expiration and removal, compliance with pseudonymization, DPO management, user-accessible UI, and more.\nBesides you can go with a free version with an MIT license.\nIt is up to you to go with Databunker or build your own solution.\nJust do not leave customer data unencrypted.\nMore info:\nhttps://databunker.org/\nhttps://github.com/securitybunker/databunker",

The key components used in this demonstration are as follows:\nAngular Material (v12) Autocomplete module.\nRxJS for action and data binding.\nAngular in-memory-web-api for REST services (Refer to in-memory-web-api).\n¬†\n\n¬†\n\n¬†\n\n\n\n\nLet us now see how we go about it:\nThe front-end consists of an angular autocomplete module. The input event taps the user's keystrokes and emits a new value into an action subject.\n\nAutocompleteService class.\n\nThe action BehaviorSubject starts with an empty string. The action$ is an observable built out of this subject.\n\nGET request. Since this is a higher-order observable (i.e., an observable returning an observable), we make use of one of the higher order functions like switchMap.\n\nswitchMap (and not other higher order functions like concatMap or mergeMap)? The reason is: switchMap unsubscribes from the previous observable once a new value is emitted by the parent observable.\nWhat this means is - as soon as the user types in another letter or removes a letter, there is simply no need to subscribe and execute the rest call for the previous values. The user is only interested to see the results of the search according to his/her current input. And switchMap does this automatically, and thus gets rid of unwanted rest calls.\nWe can also get additional control on when to fire the rest service depending on the length of the user's input. For example, in this demo, I fire the rest call only when the user has entered at least 2 characters. If not, then I return an observable of empty array (using of([])).\n¬†\n\n\n  \n  \n  Back to the Component:\n\n\nWe tap onto the above observable and use async pipe to subscribe to it. Since we are completely using observables, we can also use the OnPush change-detection-strategy.\n\n¬†\n@angular/cli - 12.1.0\nGitHub\n¬†\nCheers!",

          "description": "When you start learning TypeScript, you will come across two types - any and unknown.\nany - The any type allows us to assign literally ‚Äúany‚Äù particular value to that variable, simulating what we know as plain JavaScript.\nunknown -  The unknown type is the type-safe counterpart of any. Anything is assignable to unknown, but unknown isn't assignable to anything but itself and any without a type assertion or a control flow based narrowing.\nErrghh... Let's understand with an example.\nlet age: number;\nlet userAge: any;\n\nuserAge = 'This is some age';\nuserAge = 20;\n\nage = userAge;\n\nAnd yes, This code works! üéâ Type of userAge is any so it can be assigned any value - string, number etc.\nlet age: number;\nlet userAge: unknown;\n\nuserAge = 'This is some age';\nuserAge = 20;\n\nage = userAge;\n\nThe statement age=userAge gives an error. I mean, the type is unknown so what is the problem here? To assign an unknown value to a value with a fixed type, we have to do some quick type check!\nlet age: number;\nlet userAge: unknown;\n\nuserAge = 'This is some age';\nuserAge = 20;\n\nif(typeof userAge === 'number') {\n  age = userAge;\n}\n\nAnd now this works too! üéâ\nWhen to use what? ü§î\nunknown is a better choice if you know what you want to do with that value eventually. \nI hope you learnt at least something. Also, this was my first ever post on Dev! Thank you for reading :)",

          "description": "Pretty import paths?\n\n\nWe've all seen relative file import paths inside react applications. If you structure your apps like me you end up with terribly long paths to import other components. Auto-import can take care of that for you automatically, but isn't it hard to read and let's be honest, very, very error prone?\nOne way to solve this issue is adding webpack aliases. Now if you created your application using the create-react-app cli, you will notice that there isn't a webpack config to mess with unless you eject it running npm run eject, which will expose the entire configuration and makes you responsible of maintaining it. I prefer not ejecting my react application because I prefer the ease of use using react-scripts, so there must be another way.\nCreate React App Configuration Overri‚Ä¶",
