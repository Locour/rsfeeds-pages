Thus, Kubernetes, Openshift, and other container technologies are present everywhere.\nBut aren’t containers meant to be safe and isolated? Well, kind of.\nFor example, an exploitable vulnerability inside a container, combined with exposed metadata and a wrong credentials configuration, can compromise your whole cloud infrastructure.

Evidently, managing an AWS account with 5 users may be somewhat a walk in the park. However, as the usage of the account scales, and the number of users increases, managing account becomes trivial. Several policies must be put in place in order to organize access between different stakeholders. \nOne of the most common security features is to enable Multi-Factor Authentication on the AWS account users.\nIn this tutorial, we are going to setup a process that forbids any AWS user from using any service without:\nSetting up an MFA device.\nSigning in using MFA.

My definition is a little different in that I add an often overlooked layer - The Hardware ⚡ (along side the paired Firmware). It is a critical piece in making ANY 'stack' function. Being an Embedded Software engineer who often toes the line between the Software and Hardware/Firmware world, I want to start a project where I architect, design, and build every piece of the \"stack\" and document it all along the way. A couple pieces will have some very clear goals and challenges, others are just to have fun and see what I come up with. It may seem like I am re-inventing the wheel on a couple things, but that's the point. It's a learning exercise!\nThe high-level plan is this: \nCreate a custom PCB in KiCAD: Its purpose will be to remind you at a customized interval that you need to drink water 🌊(I desperately need to be reminded to hydrate).\nWrite firmware for the custom PCB with the ability to be updated via a custom USB bootloader and interact with the User via touch and gestures.\nWrite a cross-platform Desktop application using ElectronJS to update the the device via USB as well as pull and display your \"stats\" about your Drinking habits. Another function might be to upload the data to a backend database.\nWrite a web app to show your individual stats and a leaderboard to watch and compete against friends on.\nUtilize Github CI/CD features for testing and releasing of all Firmware/Software pieces.\nThese pieces will each take a decent bit of time to architect, build, test and document so please bear with me as the cadence of these posts will be erratic at best.

We had this opportunity at Promyze to experiment Argo CD, so we wanted to share with your our insights. \nGitOps is a concept promoted by WeaveWorks in 2017, with the core idea of describing the state of infrastructure in a Git repository. And Git is in the single source of truth.\nDo you use Kubernetes and have dozens of YAML files? Maybe you even use Helm to deploy your app as a Chart? You now assume that all these configuration files are stored within a Git repository. \nEvery time developers perform modifications in the source code of your applications, your existing continuous integration process is executed: unit tests, packaging, and finally, a new Docker…",

Last time, it happened to me a few days ago when I was to inspect the content of a base64-encoded string. The tool to the rescue is (of course not limited to) xxd. 🏅\nUsing xxd, to get the HEX representation for some binary content you just need to call it with no argument:\necho -n 'Computer says: \"Hello World!\"' | xxd\n\nDepending on the case it could be more insightful to also have the ASCII values column. That’s simply done by calling xxd with -C option:\necho -n 'Computer says: \"Hello World!\"' | xxd -C\n\nWhich results in such a neat output:\n00000000: 436f 6d70 7574 6572 2073 6179 733a 2022 Computer says: \"\n00000010: 4865 6c6c 6f20 576f 726c 6421 22 Hello World!\"\n\nAlso, xxd can do things the other way. For instance, may you need to turn a HEX string into a binary content, just call xxd with -r option, like this:\necho -n \"0x48656c6c6f20576f726c6421\" | xxd -r\n\nWhich would result in:\nHello World!\n\nThere are more xxd options which you can find by checking:\nxxd --help\n\nor\nman xxd\n\nAbout Regular Encounters\n\nI’ve decided to record my daily encounters with professional issues on a somewhat regular basis. Not all of them are equally important/unique/intricate, but are indeed practical, real, and of course, textually minimal.",

Let's start\nUbuntu\nfirst, you should know where is the interface when you assign an IP. Type this command on your terminal:\n$ ifconfig   \nor\n$ ip address\n\nafter that, so we can assign an IP to interface 'ens33' by type this command:\n$ sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml\n\nthen type this:\nnetwork:\n  ethernets:\n    ens33:\n      addresses: [172.16.238.20/24]\n      gateway4: 172.16.238.2\n      nameservers:\n        addresses: [8.8.8.8]\n  version: 2\n\n\nafter all, you must apply or enable the configure:\n$ sudo netplan apply\n$ ifconfig\n\n2: ens33: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000\n    link/ether 00:0c:29:77:41:f0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet 172.16.238.20/24 brd 172.16.238.255 scope global ens33\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n    inet6 fe80::20c:29ff:fe77:41f0/64 scope link \n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n\nDebian\nOkay, after that i think you should configure too in Debian side.

          "description": "I struggled with this concept a lot, but let me save you the stress, and explain as simply as I can.\nTypescript is just a secure way of writing JavaScript code. Do not get confused by the fancy terminologies people throw around it.\nThe good news is, if you know JavaScript, you already know ~90% of Typescript. The additional layer only forces you to be a lot more intentional about your variables and data types.\n...\nSimple answer? To catch errors early in your editor. \n...\nlet id = 1\nlet company = \"GYRO Design Lab\"\nlet isPublished = true\nlet mandem = [\"Dexter\", \"Mide\", \"Emmy\"]\n\n\nBut the unfortunate thing here is that, at some point later in your code, the variable company - for instance, could be re-assigned to a value of an entirely different data type, which would be unexpected behavior. \n…",

It gives more context to what developers were trying to achieve when they wrote their code, and allow us to do some cool things to boot. Here, we'll take a quick look at pipeline operators, how they work, and how you can use them today.\nCurrently, no browser or server side ECMAScript implementation (like Node.JS) support pipeline operators. You can, however, get them to work using Babel 7.15. You can learn more about installing Babel here, but suffice to say this will allow you to add pipeline operators into your code.\nPipeline operators are simply another way to manipulate values in Javascript.

This article assumes basic knowledge of Tailwind.\nFirst of all, let's add @layer to your index.css file in src folder. We create masonry layout class for 3 different screen;\n.masonry         (1 column)\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n@layer utilities {\n    @variants responsive {\n        .masonry {\n            column-gap: 1.5em;\n            column-count: 1;\n        }\n        .masonry-sm {\n            column-gap: 1.5em;\n            column-count: 2;\n        }\n        .masonry-md {\n            column-gap: 1.5em;\n            column-count: 3;\n        }\n        .break-inside {\n            break-inside: avoid;\n        }\n\n    }\n}\n\nNow you can use these classes as standard TailwindCSS feature. You should use them inside parent div.\n<div className=\"masonry sm:masonry-sm md:masonry-md\">\n\n  <div className=\"rounded-lg bg-gray-500 p-4 break-inside\">\n    <p> lorem100 </p>\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"rounded-lg bg-gray-500 p-4 break-inside\">\n    <p> lorem150 </p>\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"rounded-lg bg-gray-500 p-4 break-inside\">\n    <p> lorem50 </p>\n  </div>\n  <div className=\"rounded-lg bg-gray-500 p-4 break- inside\">\n    <p> lorem200 </p>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n\nThat is all. You now have a masonry layout that is simple to use and looks good.",
