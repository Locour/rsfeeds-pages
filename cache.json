The difference between them is how they manage those symlinks. If you know the correct version of Node for the project you are currently working on, you can use nvm to set it to the active version, and all is well, as long as you remember to do so. The problem here is that you need to know the correct version of Node. And if you're switching from a project that has different Node version requirements, you have to remember to switch each time you open one of those projects.

On the other, there’s Price2Spy – an advanced web crawler, looking to monitor prices on Bax Shop.\nWe’ll start off by talking about how Bax Shop came to be and give you a glimpse into its roots. Then we’ll focus on the period when they first launched their online store and how initially they fought bots on their website.

          "description": "Motivation\n\nThe usage of traditional web is still massive and we can only dream of the Web Free concept becoming reality. We already have DeBots which provide users direct connection with blockchain. Though, user experience is still pretty limited - both by functionality and visualisation. What if we combine the traditional web navigation with built-in features of DeBots by injecting DeBot into web-pages. The interaction with them can be organized through browser extensions or wallets that support the technology.\n                  The goal\n\nProvide the developers with an easy-to-use solution of injecting DeBots into traditional web-sites. Provide the users with a convenient way of communicating with blockchain using familiar tools.\nThe solution should use one of the 2 ways (both is the better) of embedding to any site:\niFrame from a third-party website\n                 Codebase\n\nThe code of DeBrowser can be used from the submissions of previous contests or created by the participant from scratch to fit the conditions of the current contest. Browser extension with the needed modifications can be also be used from the previous contests.\n                 Security\n\nTo reach the needed security level when creating and signing the transactions it’s essential to fit the following criteria:\nwhile using an extension: the keys should be stored in the extension and not transmitted to the browser\nThe solution should be visually customizable to seamlessly adopt it in site of different design. The list of customizable options should include but not be limited to:\ncolor palette\nGitHub repository\n Contest rewards\n\n1st place………… 80 000 TON\n​​Minimum score to receive reward for 1 - 5 places is 6.\nOverall prize pool: 225 000 TON\nLanding page ...https://debot.freeton.today/\nRead more...https://forum.freeton.org/t/contest-proposal-debot-web-embedding/11775",

Whereas traditional CLI commands like grep and cat are well-known tools for achieving small goals, more complicated tasks require more robust tooling.\nNowadays, CLI programs come with richer interactive experiences. One such program is the Salesforce CLI, the command-line interface for Salesforce DX. It’s a CLI that helps simplify common operations when building an application for Salesforce developers. The Salesforce CLI itself is built on top of oclif—also from Salesforce—which is an open-source framework for building command-line interfaces.

A container essentially contains the application along with all the dependencies and configuration files that it needs for running.\nMore on that later. First, let's see why do we need docker or containerization in particular.\nThe era of cloud computing sprung up a challenge of managing and maintaining the application over various cloud and development environments. Regardless of the underlying platform the application should remain stable and operational.

The normal way of handling this would be to wrap it inside a try-catch and handle the error. But when you have multiple functions this becomes tedious and error-prone.\nIn the fp world instead of throwing errors all over the place, we convert them to data. This in typescript would look something like this:\ntype Try<A> = Success<A> | Failure\n\nwhere Success is a container that wraps some value of type A and Failure is the alternative one that contains the error.\nLet’s try to implement this structure! We will use a mix of OOP and FP, to create nicely chain…",

          "description": "Hi everyone, how are you today? Hope you all are doing well!\nToday I'm going to explain how hell works and why it's important in conditional structures in typescript. Initially the concept is relatively simple, but the implementation makes us question its real reason for use.\nFirst, it is important to note that the use of hell is directly related to ternary conditions in the typescript. But why?\n\nIf we can infer T, G will be the result, if not, F will be the result\nThe purpose of inference is to test whether an inference is possible, see the example:\n\nIt turns out that when we use our custom type we will have never as an answer when trying to infer an object with no return.\n\nTake one more example, if S cannot infer in the sentence pattern it will return never.\nThere is great power when using inference in conjunction with generics and conditional structures in typescript. They are very useful when in recursive conditional structures in typescript.\nI tried to show you real use cases from hell and maybe you don't get the theory at first, but if you have any questions just send me a message and I'll be happy to answer.\n\nTime is very important, thanks for sharing a little bit of yours with me 😊.",
