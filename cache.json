Every site is different, but each one can be scraped with one of three methods.\nThe first thing you have to look at when you want to scrape a website is the network tab of the browser dev tools.\nSome websites are SSR, short for Server Side Rendered. It means that all the HTML page is generated on the backend. So what we want to scrape can be found directly in the HTML, we just have to parse it.\nTo do this you can use Axios to get the HTML page, and Cheerio to parse it.\nHere is a simple example.\nconst response = await axios.get(`https://website-url.com`);\n\nconst $ = cheerio.load(response.data);\nconst description = $('#description').html();\n\nThe last type of site you can encounter is a SPA ( Single Page Application ). In that case, the server only sends a basic HTML file and the rest of the site is generated with Javascript, client-side.\nHere is a little example to get a page h1 text.\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch();\nconst page = await browser.newPage();\nawait page.goto(\"https://website-url.com\");\n\nconst pageTitle = await page.evaluate(() => document.querySelector(\"h1\").textContent);\n\nawait browser.close();\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\nFollow me on Twitter If you want to learn how I am building RocketCrew!\nhttps://twitter.com/siglavesc2",

Let's set up the environment for playing with TypeScript and learn how to run those TypeScript files! \nFirst let's install TypeScript globally if you don't have it yet.\nnpm i -g typescript\n\n(By the way, \"npm i X\" is the short-hand for \"npm install X\")\nNow, let's create your project folder and open it in your beloved editor (mine VS Code)\nLet's init the tsconfig file, type the following command\ntsc --init\n\n(This \"tsc\" command will only work if you have typescript globally installed)\nIt'll create a \"tsconfig.json\" file. Now, what does it do you ask? TypeScript is the superset of JavaScript and how we want to compile it will be defined by this tsconfig file. The best part is, it'll give you linting (the red lines whenever there is an error in your code or logic) and also explicitly tell you what mistakes you are doing and in some cases possible solutions as well. Amazing right?\nNow you created a TypeScript file, wrote your code, for example an app.ts file with this content\nconsole.log('Hello there TypeScript! You are AMAIZING!!')\n\nNow how to run this file? If it were a JavaScript file, like app.js, you might run \"node app.js\" or \"nodemon app.js\", right? So let's find the TypeScript versions for those!\nLet's install the packages\nnpm i ts-node ts-node-dev\n\n\"ts-node\" is the TypeScript version for \"node\" and \"ts-node-dev\" is the TypeScript version for \"nodemon\". So to run the TypeScript file use either of these commands\nts-node app.ts\n\n(Which is basically \"node app.js\")\nts-node-dev app.ts\n\n(Which is basically \"nodemon app.js\")\nYIPPIE!! You just set up the environment for coding in TypeScript and also learnt how to run those FILES!! YOOOHOOOO!!! But now what?\n(including apk generating)\nDrop a comment or Feel free to reach out to me @SilveLEAF on Twitter or Linkedin\nWanna know more about me? Come here! \nSilvenLEAF.github.io",

And you have to do it ever where you need non blocking code in your application or program.\nJavascript ecosystem (like nodejs) provide this out of the box as its syntax. The JS language sytanx provide all this feature where ever needed. Morever as its part of its syntax, the reader of the code immeditetly knows that where code is blocking and where its non-blocking.\nThe blocking part of multithreaded-blocking system makes it less efficient. The thread which is blocked cannot be used for anything else, while its waiting for response.\nWhile a non-blocking single threaded system makes best use of its single thread system.\nAnd hence node.js if used properly can out perform many multi-threaded systems.",

          "description": "What is DevSecOps?\n\n\nDevOps is now the default approach to agile software development and deployment in most tech companies. With the promise of speed and quality, it seamlessly integrates the functions of development and operations teams to ensure that applications can be continuously pushed out to production. However, the emphasis on speed often comes at the cost of security. Critical vulnerabilities are addressed only late in development, with security patches often being tacked on right before deployment. This is where DevSecOps, also known as Secure DevOps, comes in.\nSimply put, DevSecOps is the future of DevOps. DevSecOps involves integrating application security testing earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This notion of shifting security to the left is commonly cal…",

I created a file named lombok.config inside the folder java (/../src/main/java/lombok.config) with this:\nconfig.stopBubbling = true\nlombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true\n\nThe config.stopBubbling informs the Lombok that the folder where the file is the root and the Lombok don't need to search for more parent folders.\nWhile lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation  put in every generated code by Lombok annotation, another one named @lombok.Generated. This annotation informs Jacoco to not collect coverage from those codes.\nDone, problem solved!\nIf you liked this post, please be sure to like and share 😄\nIf you want to know what I'm doing out there or ask any questions, feel free to look for me on social networks like @malaquiasdev.\nTo read more of my posts, go to MalaquiasDEV | Life, the code and everything else.",

So, in the top menu, you will be able to switch between these shopping lists while you're checking the products you already bought.\n\nApplication\nAPI swagger\nI used Angular Material and Angular Flex-Layout in this project.\nOn the Quarkus project I used Hibernate Panache to control the database and SmallRye JWT to protect the endpoints.\nPerhaps you can find it interesting the Swagger-UI, created automatically by the SmallRye OpenAPI, that has the possibility of doing one Authentication to test the endpoints protected by JWT.\nThanks for reading this article and feel free to talk with me in case you got interested in this project!",

Now, what does it do you ask? TypeScript is the superset of JavaScript and how we want to compile it will be defined by this tsconfig file. The best part is, it'll give you linting (the red lines whenever there is an error in your code or logic) and also explicitly tell you what mistakes you are doing and in some cases possible solutions as well. Amazing right?\nNow you created a TypeScript file, wrote your code, for example an app.ts file with this content\nconsole.log('Hello there TypeScript! You are AMAIZING!!')\n\nNow how to run this file? If it were a JavaScript file, like app.js, you might run \"node app.js\" or \"nodemon app.js\", right? So let's find the TypeScript versions for those!\nLet's install the packages\nnpm i ts-node ts-node-dev\n\n\"ts-node\" is the TypeScript version for \"node\" and \"ts-node-dev\" is the TypeScript version for \"nodemon\". So to run the TypeScript file use either of these commands\nts-node app.ts\n\n(Which is basically \"node app.js\")\nts-node-dev app.ts\n\n(Which is basically \"nodemon app.js\")\nYIPPIE!!
