I wanted to see how I could improve speed.

Improving existing CyberSecurity is a major responsibility of a SOC. \nCompliance\nOrganisation secure themselves through conformity to a security policy, as well as external security standards, such as ISO 27001x, the NIST CyberSecurity Framework(CSF) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Organisations need a SOC to help ensure that they are compliant with an important security standards and best practices. \nCoordination and Context\nAbove all, a SOC team member helps an organisation coordinate desperate elements and services and provide visualized, useful information. Part of this coordination is the ability to provide a helpful, useful set of narratives for activities on the network.
