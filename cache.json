However, forEach() is still very common, and it is sometimes more convenient for one-liners.\n\nHere's some of our best tutorials for JavaScript forEach():\n1) Iterating Through an Object with forEach()\nJavaScript arrays have a forEach() function, but general objects do not. This tutorial explains 3 ways to iterate through an object using forEach(): using Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries().\n2) How to Break Out of a JavaScript forEach() Loop\nYou can't use the break statement with forEach(), because forEach() is a function, not a loop. If you want to break out of a forEach() loop, the easiest way is to use .every() instead of .forEach(). This tutorial presents 3 ways to simulate break in a forEach().\n3) Get The Current Array Index in JavaScript forEach()\nThe forEach() function calls your callback with 3 parameters. Most forEach() loops only use the first parameter, the value. The 2nd parameter is the current array index. This tutorial shows you how to get the array index.\n4) Using Continue in JavaScript forEach()\nBecause forEach() is a function, not a loop, you can't use continue. However, with forEach(), return behaves like continue. This tutorial presents 2 alternatives for simulating continue with forEach().\n5) How to Use forEach in an Async Function\nThe forEach() function doesn't work well with async await. This is one of the major reasons why we recommend for/of over forEach(). This tutorial presents 2 alternative patterns that simulate async forEach().",

Many programming languages available today supports functional programming style. Most people would argue that they rather do things the Object Oriented way but i tell you, there is nothing wrong in using a functional programming approach to writing your code. Due to the support we get with most languages we can pass functions as arguments to to other functions, we can also return a function from another function. So the basic idea about using a functional programming approach is to isolate different processes in our code in to reusable functions.

          "description": "After you've upgraded to Angular v12 from a previous version of Angular, you may notice your ng serve times have increased, along with missing sourcemaps, and longer rebuild times during development. This post helps you set a default configuration to development to get your application serving the same as previously.\nIn Angular version 12, running ng build now defaults to production mode. This is a welcomed change, as there is less chance of accidentally deploying a development build to production, which is a lot slower and bigger, giving the perception that Angular is slow. This also aligns with other web frameworks that build for production out of the box.\nThe way Angular serves the application, it essentially does a build with watch mode. As mentioned before, doing a build is now done by default with production optimizations enabled. This adds more time to the build process.\nThere is a migration to add a \"development\" build configuration.\nTo run this migration, run:\nng update @angular/cli --migrate-only production-by-default\n\nOne caveat is that it only supports migrating first-party Angular builders for development mode, including:\n@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server\n@angular-devkit/build-angular:protractor\nTo fix this manually, you add the development options as defaults, and a defaultConfiguration set to an empty string so it doesn't default to production.\nNow, when running ng serve you will get a development build, which is faster for local development.\nIf you liked this, click the ‚ù§Ô∏è so other people will see it.

It can definitely be compared to the \"magic glue\" that connects the view and the model, keeping them both in sync\".\nOn a broader scale, it is a mechanism built into Angular that allows Angular to decide what actions can be performed when the state of the app changes. The good news is that most of the time, developers do not have to deal with change detection manually.\nHowever, if you find yourself caught in a loop, the only way to simplify your journey is to follow specific strategies, for example OnPush and trigger change detection manually if you need to. \nThere are four ways you can trigger change detection manually. Let‚Äôs look at them in detail:\ntick() on ApplicationRef **that activates change detection for the entire application by staying consistent and respectful to the strategy component of the change detection.\ndetectChanges() on ChangeDetectorRef  runs change detection on a current component.\nmarkForCheck() on ChangeDetectorRef controls change detection through the marked components where the OnPush strategy has been set.\nrun() on NgZone that allows you to execute a function inside the Angular zone. This function, and all asynchronous operations in that function, trigger change detection automatically at the correct time.\nHere is a very handy tip, which can simplify your life. \n\nIf you want to learn more listen to Angular Change Detection Episode at angularrocks.com",

Today I am writing as a type 1 diabetic feeling proud of a tool that can save lives as it has saved mine.\nOver a year ago i released the ScoutX project. It is comprised of:\nA Flask application where users can input their Nightscout entries endpoint. This app is constantly listening for values and when these are above or below range it fires and alert and calls the diabetic patient first, to alert them of irregular values. Should the patient not answer the call, an alert is sent to their trusted contacts to notify of irregular values.\n\n\nA WisBlock + Helium (IoT + LoRaWan) tracker to send data to nightscout and provide GPS precise location, so emergency contacts can receive notifications with location ‚Ä¶",

I have 2.5 years of experience in this and I can teach a few thing about this !\nFor this course we will focus on v-model directive !\nFirst problematic, how do we manage an input value in <input> ?\nWe could do the next :\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: \"HelloWorld\",\n  data: function () {\n    return {\n      message: '',\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n     updateMessage(event) {\n         this.message = event.target.value\n     }\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n<template>\n<div>\n    <input\n        :value=\"message\"\n        @input=\"updateMessage\"\n        >\n</div>\n</template>\n\nWe need to bind value of input to our current data message and handle event from this input in order to update our current data message.\nIt's not really friendly and we have to do this for every  component...\nYou can use the v-model directive to create two-way data bindings on form input, textarea, and select elements. It automatically picks the correct way to update the element based on the input type.\nSo we can replace the code above by\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: \"HelloWorld\",\n  data: function () {\n    return {\n      message: '',\n    }\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n<template>\n<div>\n    <input v-model=\"message\">\n</div>\n</template>\n\nWe can remove the method that update value ! Since v-model will directly update it.\nIt's very useful !",

Many programming languages available today supports functional programming style. Most people would argue that they rather do things the Object Oriented way but i tell you, there is nothing wrong in using a functional programming approach to writing your code. Due to the support we get with most languages we can pass functions as arguments to to other functions, we can also return a function from another function.

For example, let's say there is a set of projects and some of them depend on other projects:\n\nIn this example project B and C depends on project A, and project D depends on projects B and C. Therefore, project A must be executed first, then projects B and C, and finally project D. Resulting in this order: [A, B, C, D] or [A, C, B, D].\nNote that we start from node A because it doesn't have dependencies and repeat it, that is after A is done, B and C haven't dependencies anymore, so we can choose either one to be the next.
