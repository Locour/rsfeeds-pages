          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

          "description": "Introduction\n\n\n\nA huge portion of the Internet’s data travels over HTTP/HTTPS through request-response cycles between clients and servers.\nStarting A Server \nExpress is a Node module, so in order to use it, we will need to import it into our program file. To create a server, the imported express function must be invoked.\n\n\n\n\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\nconst PORT = 4001;\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n\nIn this example, our app.listen() call will start a server listening on port 4001, and once the server is started it will log 'Server is listening on port 4001'\nWriting Your First Route\n> Once the Express server is listening, it can respond to any and all requests. \n> For example, if your server receives a GET request at ‘/about’, we will use a route to define the appropriate functionality for that HTTP verb (GET) and path (/about).\n\n\n\n\n// Open a call to `app.get()` below:\napp.get('/expressions',(req,res, next)=>{\n   // Here we would send back the moods array in response\n})\n\nInside app.js, create a route handler to handle a GET request to '/expressions'. For now, give it a req, res, next callback. For now, log the req object inside the callback. Verify that the route works and logs the request by starting your server and clicking the Refresh Expressions button which will send a GET /expressions request.\nSending A Response\n\n\n\n\napp.get('/expressions', (req, res, next) => {\n  res.send(expressions);\n});",

Your application will appear in a specific way depending on the status. React prefers declarative over imperative programming, a fancy way of stating that you express what you want to happen rather than the processes to get there. As a result, appropriately managing the state becomes critical, as the state determines how your program will act.\nRead the full article A Contemporary Guide on React State Patterns in 2021",

XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.

This lets me update the control for each indicator independently. I set the controls to disabled, so that the values can only be triggered programmatically, rather than directly by the user. The requirement indicator values start as false since none of them should be checked at first. I like to set this up in the parent component wher…",

There are some important steps that you can take to improve your angular App’s performance substantially. Few months before, a web.dev conference discussed “How to stay fast and fresh with Angular”. The discussion was about the measures to improve angular app performance and bundle size.  The suggestions from this discussion were applied through the lens of an ionic app, Ionifits. Ionifits is a Zenefits-inspired human resource demo app showcasing various Ionic app platform technologies like Ionic Framework, Ionic Native Enterprise solutions and Capacitor. These are ready to be tested in your web, iOS or android devices. \n1. Divide App Into Modules For Native Angular Lazy Loading-\n$ ionic generate page about/about\n2. Keep Angular up-to-date Regularly With “ng update” –\n$ ng update @angular/cli @angular/core\nReference the package. json files in the Ionic starter template apps to ensure whether dependencies will work together.

          "description": "The array is still one if not the major data structure in JavaScript. Especially given the fact that Set and Map were introduced way later, many developers have grown comfortable either going with a plain array or using a library for this purpose.\nIf we now take into account that the array is the only data structure in JavaScript that comes with functional monad methods (map, filter, forEach, etc.), although there is a proposal going on to add these methods to all iterables, it's often more comfortable to go with a plain array for most purposes.\nThe JavaScript array makes no assumptions about its elements. You can mix and match types, and you can also push duplicates. But what if you only want the unique values of your array?\nGladly, there is a pretty short one-liner that makes it easy for you to filter out duplicates and get an array only containing unique values.\nYou can combine the spread operator together with the Set constructor to quickly get all unique values of an array:\nconst array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4];\n\nconst unique Values = [...new Set(array)];\n\nThere is only one issue with this code: The Set relies on the strict equality comparison (===), so it doesn't work well for objects.\nIf you like visual content more, or if you want to store it for later, I put all this into one single image for you. I hope you like it!\n\nIf you would love to read even more content like this, feel free to visit me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\nI'd love to count you as my ever-growing group of awesome friends!",

          "description": "JavaScript functions that return React elements are known as React components. These are the parameters that govern what will be added to the DOM. In addition, react components, like functions, may receive props as arguments, resulting in dynamically returned items.\nProps can be of any data type, although component data types may differ. Component A, for example, may anticipate a name argument with a text data type, but component B may anticipate an age argument with a numeric data type. Likewise, D may anticipate an onClick argument with a Function data type, but C may expect a post parameter with an object data type with characteristics like title and date.\nHow can we tell our component what kind of data it should expect?\nThis may be done in various methods, but this post will focus on PropTypes and TypeScript. Despite holding identical goals, these two techniques operate in different ways. So we’ll go through what these tools are, how to use them, and tell them apart before trying more advanced techniques.\nPrior knowledge of PropTypes and TypeScript is necessary for a thorough understanding of this article. You’ll also require an integrated development environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code.\nPropTypes is a type-checking tool for props in React apps that can be used at runtime. The PropTypes efficiency has been provided through the prop-types package since React 15.5. PropTypes let you specify the props that are expected in a component, such as whether they are mandatory or optional. You’ll get a warning in the browser’s JavaScript console if you provide a different type to an element or miss a required prop:\nRead the full article Best Practices for Checking PropTypes in React Components using TypeScript:",
