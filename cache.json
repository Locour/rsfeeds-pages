Not that it is a big deal but it looked quite messy, which I find to be a pity as they can easily be automatically removed.\nIn this article, I will show you how to do so with any node-based project using ESLint. It might sound like a very cosmetic thing and it kind of is, but I believe having too many unused imports can really hurt code readability.\nAnd as a bonus, we will also sort our import…",
