          "description": "Hi there!\nIf you have experienced significant replication lags and replication so slow that it needed hours to complete or couldn't catch up at all, I may have a solution for you.\nA couple of weeks ago, I set up a MariaDB replication from scratch for a production database. The database has a considerable size and is under heavy use.\nAs usual, I used Mariabackup to copy the entire data directory of MariaDB to the new replica server. Unfortunately, I had to interrupt my work and wasn't able to continue until 12 hours later. As I resumed where I left off, I noticed that the database grew substantially. Since I didn't want to resync about 200 GB of data, I left the rest to the replication.\nWell, It did not go as planned.

          "description": "The first time you probably hear about your child‚Äôs IQ is when there is some question about their abilities in school, whether it‚Äôs above or below expectations. This often misunderstood concept is foreign to most people, perhaps with the exception of those quick tests that they offer online. You know the ones to which I refer. But, IQ in relation to what it means for assessment, academics, and even expectations, merits serious attention.\nIQ, short for intelligence quotient, is a measure of a person‚Äôs reasoning ability. In short, it is supposed to gauge how well someone can use information and logic to answer questions or make predictions. Real IQ tests begin to assess this by measuring short- and long-term memory.\nOne should know his/her IQ score and use it to evaluate one‚Äôs self, but indiscriminately, objectivity should be maintained. For some people, knowing their IQ helps boost their self confidence and morale, and eggs them on to attempt new things, fight challenges or to tax their mental resources and stretch the arch to scale greater heights. For others, it may have adverse effects. Learning that one‚Äôs IQ is below average, can be a shattering experience. They may withdraw into themselves and tag themselves complete losers who would never taste any fruit of success.\nIntelligence quotients are definitely useful and can be instrumental in clinical practice and education, but it is important to remember what such tests are and aren‚Äôt good for. An IQ score tells a story but not always the whole story. It can be critical for helping someone on the road to success but not crippling. And it can be informative to know and sometimes unnecessary.\nSource: https://iqcertificate.org/what-is-the-importance-of-iq",

For eg : if you have a dual boot system established in your pc and your linux OS doesn't have access to the D folder.If you run this command on your linux terminal then you wont be able to see the partiton of used and unused space of D folder. this command is same as when you open the disk management tool in windows.\n\n\n\ntop\n\nThis command when you type in your terminal it will show the active linux processes which are managed by your linux kernel. This command is used like how you would use task manager in windows, the difference being , it shows the details of all the processes in far more depth than windows does.\nit will look something like this when you type the command.\n\n\nthis is what is meant by each column head.\n\nyou can press 'q' to exit this window in your termial.\nls\n  \n\n\ncd\ncd [directory name]\ncd ..\n\n\ntouch\ntouch [filename.extension]",

If you are utilizing tailwind ui and looking for a fully featured UI component library, PrimeFaces with the Tailwind theme will be an excellent choice. Note that, the theme does not use tailwind classes and instead provides a look-alike style for a unified design when used together.\n\nImage is a new addition to the UI suite to display an image with transformation options like rotate and zoom. For multiple images, please see the Galleria.\n\nThere are over 30 improvements in this release, defect fixes are mostly based on community feedback so thank you for helping us to make the library better.\nPrimeNG is licensed under MIT and free to download at NPM.\nOur current focus is on improving accessibility by creating a dedicated section per component for keyboard support and screen readers along with scores from audit tools.",

'l' : 'p', 'mm', [dashboardWidth, dashboardHeight]);\n         const imgProps = doc.getImageProperties(imgData);\n         const pdfWidth = doc.internal.pageSize.getWidth();\n         const pdfHeight = (imgProps.height * pdfWidth) / imgProps.width;\n\n         doc.addImage(imgData, 'PNG', 0, 0, pdfWidth, pdfHeight);\n         doc.save('Dashboard for hyperpanels.pdf');\n    });\n}\n\nThis will create a PDF that will be saved from your browser:\n\nAnd voil√°, your HTML turned into a PDF:\n\nLet me know if you have any doubts or comments.\nHappy coding!",

As you can imagine, without the content and note information, you basically can not remember why you marked down this link someday after two months.\nSo I think a more efficient tool should be used during taking notes on the web, especially when you are reading articles or learning something new. That is why I built context-note.\nhttps://youtu.be/ZcakhGp_-HQ\nIt is a chrome extension with three key fetarues:\nNotebook, where text content, note itself and context information would be stored.\nTagbook, manage the notes neatly with a handy tag system.\nRich text editor: embed quill as the rich text editor.\nTaking notes with their context, I believe it would be a better way to store and review things that really matter to us.",

Definitions vary, but in short a decorator is a pattern in JavaScript which is used to wrap something to change it's behavior.\nIn both JavaScript and TypeScript this is an experimental feature.
