When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

The message should say \"join mass-there\", if everything is ok you will receive a confirmation response. \n\nOnce you are in the directory where is created the project, in the terminal run the following commands:\nnpm init -y\n\nnpm install twilio@3.30.0 dotenv\n\nThe first one to iniciate a package.json and the second one for install the dependencies.\nThe next step is create the file index.js with the following code:\nconst { config } = require('./config');\n\nconst accountSid = config.sid;\nconst authToken = config.token;\nconst client = require('twilio') (accountSid, authToken);\n\nclient.messages.create({\n    from: 'whatsapp:+14155238886',\n    body: 'Hello world this is CarlosVldz!!!',\n    to: 'whatsapp:+5215555555555'\n}).then(message => console.log(message.sid));\n\n(Don't forget replace the phone numbers in this example with your sandbox number and a personal number.)\nFinally I used dotenv to configure the environment variables TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID and TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN with their values from the account credentials. You can find both in your Twilio console. \n.env.example\nTWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = \"Your account sid\"\n\nTWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = \"Your auth token\"\n\nIn your terminal run this last command to send the WhatsApp message:\nnode index.js\n\nIn your phone check WhatsApp and you should have a new chat like this.\n\nHope you liked!

It started as a hackathon project that addressed the tedium of removing manual code instrumentation. Developer environments often include hundreds of AWS Lambda functions.

So to fix this, our growth team used Amazon CloudWatch to build a prototype that could instrument AWS Lambda functions.\nThis prototype began by using AWS CloudFormation stack to automatically create resources in a customer environment.

          "description": "WhatsApp is an instant messaging application that Facebook owns. It is the third most used messaging application, according to Messenger People. Although it uses end-to-end encryption, it still collects more metadata on its users than other messaging applications like Signal. \nIn January 2021, news circulated that WhatsApp planned to roll out in-app notifications to users, informing an update in its Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It was up to the user to accept the new WhatsApp Privacy Policy and Terms of Service to continue to use the messaging application.\nThe company tweaked its terms of service and privacy policy which notified users once they entered the application. Users had to accept these updates to continue to use the application, and these changes were scheduled to be implemented on February 8th, 2021. The following were the updates made in terms of service and privacy policy:\nWhatsApp’s service and how we process your data\nHow businesses can use Facebook hosted services to store and \nmanage their WhatsApp chats\nHow they partner with Facebook to offer integrations across the \nFacebook Company Products\nRead the full article here:WhatsApp Privacy Policy: Everything You Need to Know",

It can even be used inside IDEs as a plugin.\nVim allows programmers to edit text quickly and efficiently. You can jump to the end of file using G, top of file using gg and to line 10 using 10G.

This approach, unless controlled, usually leads to low productivity in the long term.\nHow so you might ask ? Well, this behavior is really relatable for some people. When I am talking about this subject, some of you might probably say, \"Oh yes I have been there\". In Linux world, there is even a term for this. Ricing.\nRicing means tweaking the configuration of your working environment to suit your personal needs. At particular level, one might consider this useful, and it indeed is. There are some workflow approaches, shortcuts and others that helps the developer access files and folders faster, learn by muscle memory and perform some set of actions quicker. Past that particular level and you are now in the over-ricing zone. Where you are essentially tweaking every aspect of each program, work environment to your needs, but at the same time you are never satisfied so you keep tweaking and changing settings, configs and what not. It reduces your productivity and at the end of the day when you look back, you realize you have done nothing but tweaking some stuff to find the best work environment.\nThis is what I call the loop (referring to the Bandersnatch here). You are in the loop. You need to get out and you need to get sh*t done. Don't worry about using the best tool out there, don't try to find the absolute efficient program. Just get it done.\nThis is in actuality a paradox. The paradox goes as such, \"The more choices you have, the less satisfied you are\". Seems about right when you think for a bit.",

Actually I'm unaware why AppImages aren't already part of all Linux distros out there. I guess it's because everyone is trying to roll their own distribution formats?\nAnyway, An AppImage is a container format much akin to Mac Applications. You just download an AppImage from e.g. AppImageHub[2], set the execute permission on the file and off you go. No installation required - you can even place the AppImage file where ever you'd like.

          "description": "Vim is a  text editor which is highly efficient. It is an improved variant of the vi editor, that is distributed with UNIX systems. \nVim is often called a \"programmer's editor,\" and so useful for programming that many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though. Vim is perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing configuration files.\nThe vim text editor is an extremely powerful tool for developers, but it can be difficult to master.  If you are new to vim, I recommend these exercises\nIf you're using a Mac or a Linux machine, it's likely that your terminal has vim built in, so it's worth being familiar with to work on those systems. \nIf not, you can install vim with your package manager or test if vi is installed.\nTo install vim for Ubuntu, follow these instructions.\n1: Open a terminal window and type sudo apt-get install vim\nsudo apt-get install vim\n\n2: If you want to get updated version of vim, open a terminal window and type sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get update\n\n3: Then type sudo apt-get install vim\nsudo apt-get install vim\n\nThe installation process will take some time, after which all the commands of vim will be available.\n\nTo start vim, just type vim in the command line\nvim\n\nThen you can type ESC followed by :e filename to open filename.\nTo open a vim directly from the command line, type:\nvim filename\n\nPress ZQ to quit vim without saving. Press ZZ to save and exit.\nTo move the cursor, you can press ESC and use the keys h,j,k,l.  You can also use the arrow keys in vim.\n\nVim has modes. To switch to writing mode, press the i key or the insert key. To switch to command mode, press the ESC key.\nTo save your file press ESC followed by :w.\nPress :Explore to open the file explorer. Use the j and k keys and press enter to open the file. You can also use :LExplore",

So today I compiled a list of everyday linux commands that you might find useful in real life.\nLinux is solid, but you don’t realize how much you depend on it until something goes wrong. Whether it’s a simple fix or you have no idea what’s going on. We’ll start with the basics:\nls : List contents of directory\n$ ls\npublic_html\n\n$ ls -l\n-rw-r--r-- 1 owner group 0 Jan 23 13:09 index.html\n\n$ ls -l /tmp/\ntotal 616\ndrwxrwxrwt 27 root root 4096 Oct 22 14:09 .\n\ncd : Change directory\nuser@hostname:~$ cd /etc\nuser@hostname:/etc\n\nuser@hostname:~$ cd /usr/local/bin\nuser@hostname:/usr/local/bin\n\npwd : Show current directory\nuser@hostname:/usr/local/bin$ pwd\n/usr/local/bin\nuser@hostname:/usr/local/bin$ \n\nsudo : run command as root (admin)\n$ sudo ls\n[sudo] password for user: \n\nrun a program\n$ ./app\n\nAs a Linux user, you have more commands than you can count at the tip of your fingers.\nIn fact, you have enough commands to do every day tasks, including:\nUsing git version control for your project\nConnecting to your web server over ssh\nControlling your file system\nSearching for files containing a particular word in the file path\nBackup databases or interact with them\nSee your web server logs for security attacks\nOpening up a terminal-based text editor either locally or remotely\nTo get to a Linux pro level quickly, I recommend this tutorial",

This can lead to extremely messy code or Angular code that is hard to maintain as a project grows.\nThe reason I feel this happens is Angular is an opinionated framework, there is an approach you take to write Angular apps.

Besides it doesn't infere types from terms but only checks applications.\nDoing without type inference sounds like a silly idea but fortunately the validator can resort to Javascript's introspection means, so the developer only has to annotate function types.\nTechnically speaking scriptum is based on the Hindler-Milner type system extended by higher-kinded/rank types and row polymorphism. \nA runtime type system can never attain the soundness of a static one. You can think of it more as a tool for gradual typing. Here is a complex, real world example that should give an intuition how expressive this approach is.\nJavascript is…",
