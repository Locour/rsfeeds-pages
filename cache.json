          "description": "console.log is useful in a lot of situations (although there are usually better ways to debug if that's what you're doing).\nIn the browser console.log works well with objects, you can drill down as much as you need. But in Node.js, when you look at the output of a nested object, you'll often see this:\n$ console.log({a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}})\n\n{ a: { b: { c: [Object] } } }\n\nd: {} was replaced with [Object]. But why?\nIt's because the command line / terminal doesn't have a nice UI for drilling down, so Node attempts to print up to three levels deep. Beyond three levels it just prints [Object].\nThis is controlled by a variable in the node 'util' module, called depth, which defaults to 2. You can set it yourself here:\nrequire('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = 0; // top level only, e.g.:\n// { a: [Object] }\nrequire('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = null; // print everything, e.g.: \n// {\n//  a: { b: { c: { d: {} } } }\n// }\n\nIt's not a great idea to change an underlying variable, as it might come back to bite later. So a cleaner way is to convert the JSON object to a string and log that. We can use node's built in JSON class and the stringify method:\ncomplexObject = {a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}}\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(complexObject, null, 2))\n\n// {\n//   \"a\": {\n//     \"b\": {\n//       \"c\": {\n//         \"d\": {}\n//       }\n//     }\n//   }\n// }\n\nNote that the 3rd parameter of JSON.stringify, Number 2, controls the number of spaces of indentation, and the 2nd parameter can be used to filter or adjust the objects and properties shown.\nNow you can really see what's in those deep Objects.",

I need to send data from my website to the server (POST reqeust) which then emtis data to one of many raspberry PIs and gives feedback to my angular app per websocket connection.\nI have a few questions on how to do this whole process:\nI have an index.js file where I load all my express middleware etc, and some router files for specific routes. The websocket connection should be initialised outside the router so I dont open a new one every time. Should I create an on connection listener in the index.js file and outsource all the emits to a different file, or should the whole socket server live inside a different file?\n\n\nI know that socketio needs an http server to work, but I cannot pass an exress server in its constructor. Should I use an http server for my server instead and use express as a request handler? Or should I create a new http server for my websocket connection?\n\n\nShould I create a different socket server for the server/angular and raspberry/server communication (I will need to store the socketID and token/id of the raspberry in a map to know which raspberry I should send the data to) or should I use the same server with different rooms?\n\n\n\nI apologise if those questions are too basic, I have never really worked with websockets so I dont know about the best practices when working with them.

Although the growth of web apps is slower than mobile apps, web apps hold a discrete place in the business world. Not all business apps can be turned into mobile apps. Because Web apps enrich the business with unique features that will be compatible only with web platforms. Yes! Mobile apps are handy, but it is hard to fit in reports and other salient features into them. I an era when the usage of mobile phones is higher than web apps, business owners still prefer web apps over mobile apps to work smoothly.\nWeb Application Development\nWeb app development is the creation of app programs that reside in remote servers. They are delivered to the users with the help of the internet. Most of the web apps are written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Web app development comprises of front-end and back-end.\nImportance of NodeJS Developers in Real-time Web App Development:\nNodeJS developers are the ones who have the potency to develop large scale web apps with scalability and high-performance. It should be noted that real-time apps need two-way connections. NodeJS is the solution that helps business owners to develop real-time web apps with ease. In addition, developers with good programming skills can make the server and client to exchange data and communicate freely.\nIf you are looking forward to developing real-time web apps, it is about time to hire NodeJS developers. Moreover, they will be a valuable asset to your company and will transform any dreams into cost-effective apps. Here are a few points that state the importance of NodeJS developers in developing Real-time apps.\nNodeJS developers have the ability to build faster and real-time apps that of high-demand now.\nCost of Hiring NodeJS Developers:-\nSource: https://www.softsuave.com/blog/impact-of-nodejs-developers-in-real-time-web-app-development/",

We'll look at the changes and how they impact your web application environment.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \nOctober is National Cyber Security Awareness Month. On top of that, OWASP just celebrated its 20th anniversary. To celebrate, we’re going to run through the newly updated OWASP TOP 10 to remind everyone of how you can better protect your applications, your businesses, and your customers from unlawful and damaging cyber attacks. We’ll also be highlighting where the updates were made and why and throw in some tips on how strengthening your identity solution can help mitigate these threats.\nThe new Top 10 is still a working draft, and OWASP is soliciting feedback on errors and corrections.\nThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organization that was set up to help raise awareness around web application security and provides guidance on how to incorporate preventative measures into your applications, infrastructure, and internal processes.  \nThey have several projects, including an insecure JavaScript application used for security training, but the one that we’re focusing on today is the newly updated 2021 edition of their list of the top 10 threats to web app security.  \nUpdated regularly, the OWASP Top 10 lists the main security threats that affect web applications today. Each entry enumerates the threat, shows possible attack vectors, and highlights preventive measures to reduce the risk of such threat. At Auth0, we take steps to mitigate most of the issues outlined below, so when you delegate your authentication needs to us, a lot of this is already taken care of for you.\nLet’s run through the list, looking at the threats and what we could be doing to make sure our own applications are secure and examining some features of the Auth0 platform that help to mitigate or entirely remove such threats.\nFor a high-level overview of the list updates, please refer to this handy chart, provided by OWASP:\n\nRead more...",

On top of that, OWASP just celebrated its 20th anniversary. To celebrate, we’re going to run through the newly updated OWASP TOP 10 to remind everyone of how you can better protect your applications, your businesses, and your customers from unlawful and damaging cyber attacks. We’ll also be highlighting where the updates were made and why and throw in some tips on how strengthening your identity solution can help mitigate these threats.\nThe new Top 10 is still a working draft, and OWASP is soliciting feedback on errors and corrections.\nThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organization that was set up to help raise awareness around web application security and provides guidance on how to incorporate preventative measures into your applications, infrastructure, and internal processes.  \nThey have several projects, including an insecure JavaScript application used for security training, but the one that we’re focusing on today is the newly updated 2021 edition of their list of the top 10 threats to web app security.  \nUpdated regularly, the OWASP Top 10 lists the main security threats that affect web applications today. Each entry enumerates the threat, shows possible attack vectors, and highlights preventive measures to reduce the risk of such threat. At Auth0, we take steps to mitigate most of the issues outlined below, so when you delegate your authentication needs to us, a lot of this is already taken care of for you.\nLet’s run through the list, looking at the threats and what we could be doing to make sure our own applications are secure and examining some features of the Auth0 platform that help to mitigate or entirely remove such threats.\nFor a high-level overview of the list updates, please refer to this handy chart, provided by OWASP:\n\nRead more...",

Mobile apps are handy, but it is hard to fit in reports and other salient features into them. I an era when the usage of mobile phones is higher than web apps, business owners still prefer web apps over mobile apps to work smoothly.\nWeb Application Development\nWeb app development is the creation of app programs that reside in remote servers. They are delivered to the users with the help of the internet. Most of the web apps are written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Web app development comprises of front-end and back-end.\nImportance of NodeJS Developers in Real-time Web App Development:\nNodeJS developers are the ones who have the potency to develop large scale web apps with scalability and high-performance. It should be noted that real-time apps need two-way connections. NodeJS is the solution that helps business owners to develop real-time web apps with ease. In addition, developers with good programming skills can make the server and client to exchange data and communicate freely.\nIf you are looking forward to developing real-time web apps, it is about time to hire NodeJS developers. Moreover, they will be a valuable asset to your company and will transform any dreams into cost-effective apps.

For us Angular developers, it unfortunately did not ship in time for Angular 12.\nI've summarized key takeaways from Ben Lesh’s talk from RxJS Live Asia and his slides below. Lesh is a member of the RxJS core team and formerly worked at Google on the Angular team.\nLesh said while RxJS 7 was “a bit faster,” the big improvement for the new version is its bundle size. RxJS 7 is 53% the size of RxJS 6. If your app used every operator in version 6, that would require 52 KB, but the same thing in RxJS 7 requires just 19 KB.\n“This was done via a refactor, a hundred-point improvement of going around and individually moving around code, keeping the same tests, keeping the same code, and moving things around slowly but surely until we got to a place where we could see daylight and…",

          "description": "console.log is useful in a lot of situations (although there are usually better ways to debug if that's what you're doing).\nIn the browser console.log works well with objects, you can drill down as much as you need. But in Node.js, when you look at the output of a nested object, you'll often see this:\n$ console.log({a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}})\n\n{ a: { b: { c: [Object] } } }\n\nd: {} was replaced with [Object]. But why?\nIt's because the command line / terminal doesn't have a nice UI for drilling down, so Node attempts to print up to three levels deep. Beyond three levels it just prints [Object].\nThis is controlled by a variable in the node 'util' module, called depth, which defaults to 2. You can set it yourself here:\nrequire('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = 0; // top level only, e.g.:\n// { a: [Object] }\nrequire('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = null; // print everything, e.g.: \n// {\n//  a: { b: { c: { d: {} } } }\n// }\n\nIt's not a great idea to change an underlying variable, as it might come back to bite later. So a cleaner way is to convert the JSON object to a string and log that. We can use node's built in JSON class and the stringify method:\ncomplexObject = {a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}}\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(complexObject, null, 2))\n\n// {\n//   \"a\": {\n//     \"b\": {\n//       \"c\": {\n//         \"d\": {}\n//       }\n//     }\n//   }\n// }\n\nNote that the 3rd parameter of JSON.stringify, Number 2, controls the number of spaces of indentation, and the 2nd parameter can be used to filter or adjust the objects and properties shown.\nNow you can really see what's in those deep Objects.",
