          "description": "In this tutorial, we’ll find out how we can use Apollo Client with React and TypeScript to power our front-end apps. We love Apollo Client because of its built-in robust state management, in-memory caching, and error handling capabilities. To keep the demo simple we’re not going to write any backend code for this presentation, and use the publicly available SpaceX GraphQL API.\nTo make our lives simpler we’re also going to start with create-react-app, specifically with a typescript template:\nyarn create reac…",

          "description": "After integrating @ntegral/nestjs-sentry in my NestJS project, I was surprised to find errors in my logs that weren't being reported to Sentry.\nAfter a bit of investigation, I found that NestJS' native concepts of Interceptors and ExceptionFilters are built around the idea that the execution context will be somehow request-generated. i.e. These constructs expect errors to be triggered by an external request to the server via e.g. HTTP or GraphQL.\nUnfortunately, when using the Cron decorator from @nestjs/sch…",
