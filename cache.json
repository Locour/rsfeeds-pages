This bypasses UFW which causes our app to be exposed to the world.\nThe problem is that our port mapping tag exposes our app:\n-p 3000:5000\nRestricting access to localhost is a simple change:\n-p 127.0.0.1:3000:5000\nThis binds port 5000 inside the container to port 3000 on the localhost or 127.0.0.1 interface on the host machine.\nOur app is now blocked from external traffic!\nGCP, AWS and even OVH all have external firewalls that sit infront of the server.

          "description": "In Angular, we use HTTP to get data from backend,HTTP methods always return an observable.Generally we subscribe to that observable and assign response data to class variables to use it in our component.\nBut using RxJS operators we can compose multiple observables(data streams) or process  observable data  before subscribing to it.\nRxJS concatMap operator\nObservable emits observable).\nconcatMap operator\nTakes each value from the outer observable and maps that value  to observable(called as inner observable) \nConcat all inner observables into a single observable in order  and subscribe to inner observables and emit data of each inner observable into output observable in sequential manner.\nconcatMap never subscribes to the next inner observable until the previous one completes.\nExample:\n\nRun live\nHere we have 2 API’s\nIn the above case we need to take all roll numbers from the first API  and pass it to the second API.\n\nSo solution to this problem is use concatMap RxJS operator instead of nested subscription.\n\nFirst contactMap operator -\ngetToppers_rollNum() this method returns an Observable of type number[] , conactMap  maps Observable<number[]> to Observable <number>(inner observable) then subscribes to inner observable and emit data into output observable(top_3_rollNum$).\nSecond  concatMap operator -\ntop_3_rollNum$ as outer observable.concatMap takes each roll number from the outer observable and hits http request sequentially(here we have 3 inner observables return by 3 http requests) & emits http response data into output observable(topper_marks$).\nconcatMap never hits the next http request until the previous one completes.\nShorthand syntax for above code\n\nSo,concatMap is used where sequence of execution matters.\nThanks for reading!

It’s a complicated framework sometimes and there are lots of things that devs “just have to remember” or there will be bugs in your application that you won’t see until runtime.\nI wanted to remove this cognative load from NestJS engineers so that they can focus on valuable work instead. I wrote an ESLint plugin to alert developers directly in their IDE or editor when these common issues exist - (Available on NPM) https://www.npmjs.com/package/@darraghor/eslint-plugin-nestjs-typed\nHere is what I learned about writing ESLint plugins in typescript for typescript while building the plugin.\nESlint is the default linting tool in the JavaScript ( E CMA S cript) ecosystem. It is a command line tool but there are integrations with all popular IDEs and text editors.\nFrom …",
