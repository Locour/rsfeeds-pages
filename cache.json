          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

          "description": "Being used to npm based projects for years, I encountered a yarn based one yesterday. I've read about yarn before, but never got the chance to work on it until now. So, I searched around to find the basics to get it working. I found it to be pretty similar to npm so far, with a few changes here and there. If you've cloned a project repo already setup with yarn, these are the general instructions to follow:\nMake sure yarn is installed globally:\nnpm install -g yarn\n\nThen, move to project folder and upgrade to latest in yarn 1.x branch:\ncd ~/path/to/project\nyarn set version latest\n\nInstall the project dependencies:\nyarn install\n\nAnd the finally, build and/or run the project. Similar to npm based projects, you can check package.json file in the project folder and find the necessary commands listed there. Should be like yarn build, yarn dev, yarn start, yarn serve, etc.\nAnother interesting thing to keep in mind is, the yarn equivalents of npm install --save and npm install --save-dev are yarn add and yarn add --dev, respectively. I found it mentioned on the documentation page of yarn install command.\nYarn 2.x is meant to be installed per project. So, follow the same steps as yarn 1.x described above, but just before yarn set version latest, run this:\nyarn set version berry\n\nCheck if yarn is on version 2.x with:\nyarn --version\n\nNow, follow the same steps for 1.x. For more info, refer to Yarn 2 docs.\nIf you're like me and accidentally installed yarn 2.x on a 1.x based project 😅, don't worry! It's nothing a few commands can't fix. Run:\nyarn set version classic\n\nAnd then follow the steps described above for yarn 1.x. The documentation page for yarn set version command describes more ways to set specific versions.\nYarn Documentation\nCover image from Get Logo Vector",

One might ask, why not use the fetch api that is already built into all modern browsers? My answer is always interceptors. \nHaving previously worked with Angular in my past jobs, one of the niceties its' built-in client offers is the ability to capture or intercept outgoing http requests. Since React doesn't care about which libraries we use with our UI, we have to make these decisions on our own. \nThis means choosing something like which http client we are using  is left to us and luckily enough there are plethora of options in the Javascript eco-system.

Especially given SaaS spending is expected to increase an additional 36% between 2020 and 2022. \nA SOC 2 certification from the AICPA is a foundational step that will help every service provider reduce security risks. Below is a guide to SOC 2 compliance requirements and certification.\nSOC 2 is an independent audit report that evaluates the security controls a tech service business uses to protect the data they process in the cloud. Possession of a SOC 2 report is considered table stakes in the SaaS industry, as the answers to most security questions a customer may have about their business’s security posture can usually be pulled from this report.\n“SOC” stands for “System and Organization Controls” and was created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). SOC 2 is one of three SOC reports, each with different purposes and/or levels of transparency:\nSOC 1. Used to audit internal controls relevant to a customer’s financial systems. Report usage is “restricted,” meaning its use is limited to auditors, the service organization, and authorized users.\nSOC 2. Used to audit the overall management of customer data. Report usage is also “restricted” the same way SOC 1 is.\nSOC 3. The same as SOC 2, but the report is simplified and publicly available to increase transparency.\n\nRead more...",

Here is what businesses need to know to comply.\n\n\nIf your business processes protected health information (PHI) in the United States, you’ll need to familiarize yourself with both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act.\nBoth pieces of legislation provide legal guidelines for managing PHI in the United States and come with strict penalties for violations. For example, two health care networks were fined $5.5M each in two of the worst violations in recent history.\nHowever, each law manages and protects health data in different ways (and for different reasons). Below is a summary of what each law could mean for your business if it processes PHI in any format.\n\nHIPAA and HITECH are two separate laws with two different goals:\nHIPAA was passed in 1996 and was the first U.S. law to regulate how protected health information was managed. It introduced a set of security controls and privacy rights aimed at reducing fraud and waste in health care. HIPAA defined who was required to comply with its regulations (which HIPAA called “covered entities”) and how they were required to do so in order to protect health data.\nThe HITECH Act was passed in 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to encourage HIPAA-covered entities to adopt electronic health records (EHRs) for managing PHI. It offered financial incentives from 2011 to 2015 to transition to EHRs and to improve the delivery of healthcare. The HITECH Act also introduced new technical security standards (in addition to a few other things below) that complement and enhance HIPAA as well.\n\nRead more...",

Innovation, infrastructure management, versatility, and scalability are just a few reasons why Salesforce commands that position.\nHowever, DevOps for Salesforce is tricky. Most of the core principles and techniques of DevOps fail with Salesforce. One of the biggest challenges Salesforce customers with complex systems face is dealing with thousands of moving parts but lack a systematic way of tracking, managing, and deploying them.\nNevertheless, with the release of Salesforce DX in 2016, a lot of teams are in the p…",

The best way to learn that is by mastering YAML processing tool such as yq, which can make you way more efficient at many of your daily tasks, from simple lookups to complex manipulations.

          "description": "In this guide, we’ll explore the methods applied to create a software LVM RAID in Linux. Also, we will show you a simple solution to recover any data lost from an LV RAID 5 system as a result of accidental removal or unexpected drive failure.\n\nLVM RAID is a method to create a logical volume (LV) which uses several physical disks to improve performance or fault tolerance. Within LVM, physical disks (abbreviated as PV, physical volumes) belong to one volume group (VG).\nAlthough it is much safer to use MD RAID, if you really need to migrate from conventional disks to a RAID system without having to change their file systems, this method can be very useful.\nAllocating information with blocks of logical volume data on physical disks is determined by a specific RAID type.

If you are a Windows user you might have seen different drives such as C, D, E, etc which are absent in Linux instead it has folders named /bin, /sbin, /usr, /etc.\nFor new Linux users, let us tell you about how Linux and windows evolved. Windows was installed on top of DOS(Disk operating system), which was a command-line tool where you can run programs, games, etc. It used letters to assign removable discs such as floppy drives, i.e. A and B. When the hard drive was introduced, the letter C was assigned for the internal disk and the next available letter for the next disk.\nMicrosoft evolved their kernel so that windows boots are less dependent on DOS and eventu…",

Two interesting applications of the latter topic include dynamic routing through an application and dynamic component layout.

When injected, HttpBackend dispatches requests directly to the backend, without going through the interceptor chain. So as per the definition, we can surely use it for our current use case.\nconstructor(private http: HttpClient, private httpBackend: HttpBackend) {}\n  callWithoutInterceptor() {\n    this.httpBackend\n      .handle(new HttpRequest('GET', 'https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random'))\n      .subscribe();\n  }\n\nNow when we click on the Button we will notice that the console is not printed but in the network tab, we can see the API call made.\n\nHereby using HttpBackend we were able to bypass the application-wide interceptor.

We need to turn off and on the backend, swap modules around to enable or disable the mocking and be careful to not deploy any of that the production.\nWell, not anymore.\nMSW as they say, is the API mocking of the next generation.

          "description": "Sometimes when writing an app in React you might have a component that changes its look and logic dramatically depending on provided props. In addition, if a particular prop provided, the other props become either required or restricted. That hidden prop relation can be explained in documentation but if your project uses Typescript there is a great opportunity to utilize what I call \"sets of props\".\nIt's usually not the best idea to make buttons look like links and vice versa but let's ignore this for the sake of clarity. The code snippet below is so-called Clickable component which can be either a link or a button that shares the same style but has different behavior depending on props.\nimport { ReactNode } from 'react'\n\ninterface BaseProps {\n  children: ReactNode\n}\n\ninterface AsButtonProps extends BaseProps {\n  as: 'button'\n  onClick: () => void\n  href?: never\n}\n\ninterface AsLinkProps extends BaseProps {\n  as: 'a'\n  href: string\n  onClick?: never\n}\n\ntype ClickableProps = AsButtonProps | AsLinkProps\n\nconst Clickable = ({ children, as, onClick, href }: ClickableProps) => {\n  return (\n    <>\n      {as === 'a' && (\n        <a href={href}>{children}</a>\n      )}\n\n      {as === 'button' && (\n        <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>\n      )}\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Clickable\n\nThe component has four props. children is required in any case so it's put under the BaseProps interface. Both AsButtonProps and AsLinkProps extended from BaseProps and represent two sets of props. The active set depends on the value of the as prop while the type never for unused props makes sure that Typescript will yell if someone is using a prop which does nothing.\nHere is a scheme:\n\nThis pattern is obviously not limited to props in React. It's widely used in the types of various npm packages. Now you can add it to your arsenal and build reusable components/utils with better API for you and your team.\nTypeScript Deep Dive: Never Type\nSyntaxFM: Episode 348.

These range from gamification of business applications to data-driven user experiences. Two interesting applications of the latter topic include dynamic routing through an application and dynamic component layout. Both are examples of user experiences that vary based on factors such as user role and prior uses of the application. In other words, two different users may be presented with an entirely different experience based on both a priori knowledge of the user and how the user interacts with the application in real tim…",

While Typescript may enforce types in your code if you happen to pass a string to a type expecting a number things will still compile and may even work as expected still. With Rust this is not the case.
