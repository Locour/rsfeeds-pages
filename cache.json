          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

Also some of the information on learning new techniques with Node.js is outdated - for example the sheer number of Express tutorials you still find out there! Express is long overdue for a replacement, and Fastify fits right in!  One of the first things to consider when running a Node.js server is how to handle logging the right way. ExpressJS did not offer anything out of the box, forcing another bike shed to paint amongst your team.  Fastify on the other hand recognizes that this is a critical piece of running a server and provides sensible defaults - in the case of logging - the pino logger.

But what do you need to know if you're going to move that app to a production environment on the public Internet? What if you're using it for your job and need to pass security scans and DevOps checks?\nIn this series, I introduce some basic concepts for making production ready containers. I also introduce the concept of \"slimming\" a container. Slimming refers to both optimising and minifying your Docker containers, reducing them in size by up to 80-percent while also making them more secure by decreasing the attack surface. Slimming your container is also a great way to implement container best practices w…",

For example, you might want your dev environment connected to your dev API Endpoint, QA to QA endpoint and production to a production endpoint. We could solve this by using a single .env file but, each time you push your code to specific environments you need to remember to change the endpoint values, which is a slight headache and can be error prone. Let’s see how we can solve this!\n \nFirst, get the package env-cmd from npm by running\nnpm install — save-dev env-cmd\nNext, create your environment specific .env files. In this example, I’ve created a folder named “environments” in my root directory (same level as package.json). Important the environment variables MUST start with REACT_APP_ . Read more here.\nREACT_APP_API_END_POINT==http://my-dev-url.com\n\nPlease note .dev.env, .qa.env and .prod.env are three separate files in the environments folder. See below\n\nNext, update the package.json . Update the scripts portion of your package.json to include the following:\n“scripts”: {\n\n\nNext start your local/dev react application by running\nnpm run start:dev\nYou can test your env variable in your app by doing the following\nconsole.log(process.env.REACT_APP_API_END_POINT);\nFor QA and Production build replace the command npm run build to the newly added environment specific command npm run build:qa or npm run build:prod respectively. (For example, if you are on AWS, edit the buildspec on Codebuild and replace npm run build with npm run build:qa or npm run build:prod)\nI hope this article was helpful. Thanks and Cheers!",

If you would like more information about the nginx server  you can find it here: https://www.nginx.com/\nTo get started we create a dockerfile with two stages:\nStage 1\nCopy the angular code from a local machine to a docker machine.\nCopy the packages.json to install dependencies.\nInstall the angular-cli and npm dependencies.\nBuild an angular application.\nFor this stage we use a node machine image from the dockerhub https://hub.docker.com/_/node\nStage 2\nCopy the angular dist folder from the previous docker machine named build on to the nginx location folder.\nThen we use the default cmd that starts the nginx server. \nFor this stage we will use a node machine from the dockerhub https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx\nFROM node:12.7-alpine AS build\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY / ./\nCOPY package*.json ./\n\nRUN npm install -g @angular/cli@10.0.4 && \\\n    npm install && \\\n    ng build\nCOPY . .\n\nFROM nginx:1.17.1-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY --from=build /app/dist/ui /usr/share/nginx/html\n\nOnce that is done, we will create the Dockerfile, and build the image to run it.\n> docker build -t <image_name> -f Dockerfile .\n\nNow we can verify if the image is created by running the following command.\n> docker images\n\nNow that we have created the image in order to run it we have two options:. \ndocker-compose.yml file like this:\nversion: '3'\nservices:\n    server:\n        image: <image_name>\n        ports:\n            - \"80:80\"\n        tty: true\n        expose:\n            - \"80\" \n        stdin_open: true\n        environment:\n            - MODE=dev\n        command: <command to run>\n\nIf we want to run a command when we run the image we can specify on command.\ndocker run -d -p 80:80 <image_name> command\n\nHope you liked and also helps you in case you have to dockerize an angular app.",

          "description": "When I was setting up our production monorepo at modfy.video, I found most typescript monorepo guides were quite lacking in addressing a lot of more detailed problems you run into or how to solve them with modern solutions.\nThis guide aims to do that for 2021, with the best in class tooling at this time. That said when using modern advanced tooling, you can and will run into some compatibility problems so this guide might be slightly esoteric for you.\nThis guide is really optimized towards typescript monorepos that also contain packages that can be deployed but really should work for any typescript monorepos.\nFor this guide, we will be using pnpm but this should mostly work the space with yarn just swap out pnpm workspaces with yarn workspaces. (This will likely not work well with npm and …",

          "description": "There's a ton of HTML multi-step form examples out there: see https://csshint.com/multi-step-html-forms/ for instance. So why create another one? Simply put, I couldn't find a form that satisfied my two main requirements:\n1) Responsive. The form should look good on a phone, a desktop, and everything in between. It's 2021 and most web traffic now goes  through mobile devices, so making your pages responsive should be a top priority.\nI was also looking for the following:\nHere's what I came up with:\n\n\n\n\nThe labels will disappear when there isn't enough horizontal space for them, but the form isn't smart enough to figure out the perfect breakpoint on its own: you'll have to manually specify that value in multi-step-nav.css. \nWhy add next and previous buttons in each step instead of reusing the same buttons everywhere? Doing it like this actually helps with the tabbing behavior: if you've tabbed to a next/previous button and press Enter, tabbing again will move you to the top of the new section, instead of tabbing out of the form towards the bottom of the document.\nThere's one accessibility feature I couldn't seem to figure out, however. When using NVDA (the most popular desktop screen reader according to the latest WebAIM survey) in browse mode, using the down arrow after pressing the Next or Previous button won't start reading at the top of the newly selected section. Anyone out there know how to fix this? 🙂\nCover photo by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash",

We'll have a look at how we can solve it and we'll learn how to implement a binary search algorithm in JavaScript along the way.\nThe task is clear but the interviewer shared a couple more details about the problem:\nFor simplification purposes, consider the sea is a rectangle grid divided in square cells.\nGiven inputs: dimensions (width and height) of the sea.\nExpected output: location (cell coordinates) of the boat.\n\nWe'll consider that the radar takes an area…",
