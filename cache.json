          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

However, the MERN stack introduces a problem. React renders the frontend code with JSX, so you can't use those view engines, and you instead need a new way to render backend data for the client. You might suggest using JSX as your backend view engine, but then you would be losing a lot of the functionality that React brings to t…",

          "description": "Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment and a very popular tool for building applications. It runs on V8 JavaScript engine which makes it highly performant. It was released in 2009 and since then it is getting more and more popular. One of the advantages is that it uses JavaScript programming language which means that the same programming language can be used for server-side and client-side applications. There are few popular frameworks which run on Node.js platform and most popular is Express. In this tutorial I am going to use Express framework.\nA big positive change emerged when the TypeScript language was released.

Of course, the Octane package just came out and paints to exceed or at least reach the speed of the same web developed in Node. Meanwhile php is being less supported every day and despite the push it has been having with Laravel I think it will be left behind with the release of new Node frameworks.\n\n\nAdonisJS: It is a Laravel in Node, but today it has almost no community, even though I read that its discord is very active.\n\n\nNestJs: It is the most popular Node framework, I understand with which all kinds of rest apis can be developed. It also offers Fastify which is very convenient over Express due to support for asynchronous calls. I want to clarify that it is the one that investigates the least.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  The other part of the stack:\n\n\nThe idea would be to use ReactJS for Front and React Native for Mobile development.\nI am also thinking of using InertiaJS or NextJS.\nWe are implementing Docker and Kubernetes.\nMy question is directed for you to comment without choosing sides, trying to be as impartial as possible.\nWhat Technology Stack would you use?\nGreetings and thank you very much for reading.",

However, when you are outside, using public Wi-Fi will give you a nightmare if you aren't aware of the risk of security issues. So, if you are considering whether to connect to the public Wi-Fi network at the shopping mall, the airport, etc. beware of the potential risk to your device because hackers love public Wi-Fi!\nThe most effective trick to staying safe on public Wi-Fi is to use a VPN on your devices. Although virtual private networks are not infallible, they can protect your privacy.

He borrowed from several programming languages: Java (syntax, primitive values versus objects),\nJavaScript did not have exception handling until ECMAScript 3, which explains why the language so often automatically converts values and so often fails silently: it initially couldn’t throw exceptions.\nOn one hand, JavaScript has quirks and is missing quite a bit of functionality (blockscoped variables, modules, support for subclassing, etc.). On the other hand, it has several powerful features that allow you to work around these problems. In other languages, you learn language features. In JavaScript, you often learn patterns instead. Given its influences, it is no surprise that JavaScript enables a programming style that is a mixture of functional programming (higher-order functions; built-in map, reduce, etc.) and object-oriented programming (objects, inheritance).",
