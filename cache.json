          "description": "Login to web apps quickly and securely using a finger or face biometrics.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \nThe average person has to keep track of approximately 100 passwords and spends almost 13 minutes every week resetting those passwords. Due to this friction, password reuse is a major issue with over two-thirds of end users reusing passwords across sites, creating widespread security vulnerabilities. The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) found that credential vulnerabilities are involved in more than 80% of all data breaches. Since password reuse is so common, a single compromised password can endanger multiple accounts. \nAuth0 was the first IAM system to build support for passwordless authentication, and all of these reasons are as pertinent as ever:\nPasswords are insecure: users pick insecure passwords and reuse them across sites. Since data breaches are common and they frequently include password information, this creates a situation where more and more sites are vulnerable to hacking attempts.\nPasswords are expensive to manage: users forget them, and resetting passwords can be an expensive and time-consuming process.\nPasswords negatively impact customer retention: remembering and typing a password, particularly on a phone keyboard, carries friction, and can cause returning customers to abandon the login flow, therefore impacting retention.\nWe believe that moving away from passwords as an authentication method is key to making the internet safer while reducing friction and positively impacting user acquisition and retention. \nSince our initial release, the authentication industry has been hard at work finding better ways to implement passwordless authentication. For example, the FIDO Alliance successfully led the specification and implementation of WebAuthn. In the last few years, Webauthn has been implemented in all major OS/browsers, with iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 being the latest to join the party in September 2020.  \n\nRead more...",

The intended audience is primarily people in DevOps roles, but I think it will also be beneficial for those who are just starting to learn Go and are looking for a practical project to help them get started. Below is a detailed outline of the series so you know exactly what you will learn:\n++++YouTube Playlist Link++++\nSeries Outline:\nVideo 1: Creating a Slack App - This video doesn't include any coding but covers the pre-requisite steps you must complete in order for the Go program that you write in later videos to work properly\nVideo 2: How to Publish a Message - Now you get to write some code, and I introduce you to the https://github.com/slack-go/slack library. Using the slack-go library, I show you how to send messages to a channel in your Slack workspace\nVideo 3: Command-line arguments and Block Kit - I walk you through modifying the Go program to accept command-line arguments and I introduce you to Slack's Block Kit.\nVideo 4 : Run our Slack Bot as a Jenkins Post-Build Action - This video focuses more on integrating the program with Jenkins so most of it is optional if you're more interested in learning Go. I walk you through the development of a Jenkins pipeline that runs the Go program as a post-build action (and sends a notification to your designated Slack channel on whether the Jenkins pipeline build passed or failed).\nVideo 5: Convert Bot to Microservice and add API Endpoint - I walk you through re-architecting the Go program as a microservice with a single API endpoint, rather than having Jenkins run the program on the Jenkins node.\nVideo 6: Add JSON processing to our API endpoint - I introduce you to JSON processing in Go using \"encoding/json\" so that the API endpoint in the microservice accepts JSON arguments.\nI hope that you find the series valuable and moreover that you enjoy it!",

Try the following type pwd and you will see that you‚Äôre in your download directory.\nFor Linux you can type clear or Ctrl+L to Clear the screen. It works in most terminal.\nCommand ls is equivalent to the DOS dir command, that it show lists files and directories. This command has some common attributes, example like:\nls -a for show all folders and files including visible and hidden.\nls -l for show the contents of the directory in full, starting from access rights, owner, group and the date the file or directory was created.\nls -i show directory contents and size.\nFor troubleshooting you can use command tail -f. Example like this tail -f /var/log/daemon.log.\nIf you want to see the previous commands, you can type history in your terminal. Meanwhile, to search command history in Linux, press ctrl+R, then just type the previous command you want to search or use.",
