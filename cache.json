So, to take advantage of all the cores available we need to launch a cluster of Node.js processes.\nFor this we can use the native cluster module which creates several child processes (workers) that operate parallelly. Each generated process has it's own event loop, V8 instance and memory. The primary process and worker process communicate with each other via IPC (Inter-Process Communication).\nNote: Code from this tutorial will be available in this repository\nLet's initialize and setup our project!\n$ yarn init -y\n$ yarn add express typescript ts-node\n$ yarn add -D @types/nod‚Ä¶",

In my case, I use a Raspberry Pi to backup things like RAW images from my camera to an off-site location. The extra security gives me a little peace of mind, especially as the server generally uses a cellular connection.\nI‚Äôve been using UFW to work as a killswitch and only allow traffic via the VPN connection, but one issue I've had is with my trusted VPN provider is that they regularly rotate IP addresses.

          "description": "Continuous Integration is a great software development practice, we can reduce integration problems and we can allow teams to develop cohesive software more rapidly.\nThere are many interesting CI tools in the market but I think the dev CI experience can still be improved. I see companies and dev teams struggling and disappointed when they have to run and setup CI pipelines.\nMost of the IT companies care about code privacy and they don‚Äôt like the idea to run their code on external public CI platforms. It's possible to have CI solutions on-premise but most of the time this kind of solutions are expensive for the company. For example, Atlassian has stopped selling new on-prem server licenses. ref.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Build queue and CI debug:\n\n\n\nAs a developer and member of a tech team I‚Äôd like to see our CI builds running immediately after a code change and I‚Äôd like to see an easy way for debugging the code when it‚Äôs running on CI. Most of the time I see teams and developers complaining about long builds queues and usually it‚Äôs even quite difficult debugging the code if an error happens during the CI process.\nHow many times we see commits failing on CI because the code has not been tested enough locally or the code has not been rebased with the main branch yet. Every time we run a build on Cloud it‚Äôs a cost for the team and the company. The good news is we can now easily avoid this scenario. Few years ago, Git has introduced \"Git hooks\", this new technology allows developers to execute pre-tests before a commit will trigger a new CI process in Cloud.\nAfter a long brainstorming with some friends, we created a small CI tool localci.io to address all these issues. This tool doesn‚Äôt fit with any IT infrastructure, but this could be useful at least for some team. Probably, in the future it will be completely free but currently we still need to cover some cloud costs.",

They were building a web application for one of their customers based on the Angular framework from what I understand. The backend/serverside code was written in Java. The interesting part is that they used some way to turn the expoted Java-WAR into a file they would include in the Angular project. This allowed them to call methods from that service and, what was the most interesting to me, the classes for the project were only defined in that Java code yet perfectly usable in that Angular code. I saw some kind of service URL in the code which I assume is somehow being used to make the actual calls in some way.\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to dig deep enough/get into the deeper questions I had regarding the whole procedure. \nI don't have any experience with Java, writing mostly little PHP and C# applications so far so I wondered - is a model like this possible to set up with Angular and PHP? If yes, where do I need to look in terms of guidance to set something like that up with my Angular project? What are some key things I need to know before tackling something like this? Is it even worth doing like that?\nThere's a lot floating in my head right now regarding this because this is kinda exciting to me, any and all help would be greatly appreciated",

I wanted to scroll to a component when its loaded on screen or on some other event. If you have worked with pure js, then there is a very simple solution using scrollIntoView function.\nconst elmnt = document.getElementById(\"content\");\nelmnt.scrollIntoView();\n\nRun the above code on that particular event and it works like a charm.\nNow when I searched for a solution in React, I came across this library react-scroll.

The original intent seems to be externalizing lib.dom.d.ts as @types/web so that users can have separate upgrading schedule for TypeScript's core type definitions and one for DOM. The type definitions for DOM are fragile and often breaks backwards compatibility, probably because they are auto-generated.\nThanks to this nicely generalized solution for externalized standard library, better-typescript-lib, a library developed by the author, also receives huge benefit.

Each generated process has it's own event loop, V8 instance and memory. The primary process and worker process communicate with each other via IPC (Inter-Process Communication).\nNote: Code from this tutorial will be available in this repository\nLet's initialize and setup our project!\n$ yarn init -y\n$ yarn add express typescript ts-node\n$ yarn add -D @types/nod‚Ä¶",
