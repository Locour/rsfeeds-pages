He is taking a course through his employer and using a work computer with Windows installed.\nInitially, I saw that he was using Git Bash ... mostly unsuccessfully. In particular, the Angular CLI was failing with command not found. He apparently had figured out some creative npx commands.\nI wanted something simpler for him.\nKnowing he had NodeJS installed, we set the path to the Angular CLI and made a custom shortcut to the NodeJS Command Prompt.\nWe followed the rabbit hole and found the Angular CLI in the following location ...\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\@angular\\cli\n\nThen, we opened the Environment Variables and added this to the Path. This ensures that we are able to reference the CLI in the command prompt later.\n\n\nThen, we located the NodeJS Command Prompt shortcut ...\nC:\\Program Files\\nodejs\n\nWe then copied the shortcut and placed it on the desktop to make things a bit easier.\nThe biggest change we made to the shortcut was to set the \"Start In\" folder to the root of his projects folder ... we got to these settings by Right-Clicking and selecting Properties.\n\nThis simple setup gave him much more flexibility without any hassles for Angular development using the CLI.",

In my case, I use a Raspberry Pi to backup things like RAW images from my camera to an off-site location. The extra security gives me a little peace of mind, especially as the server generally uses a cellular connection.\nI‚Äôve been using UFW to work as a killswitch and only allow traffic via the VPN connection, but one issue I've had is with my trusted VPN provider is that they regularly rotate IP addresses. UFW uses iptables under the hood, meaning it can only be configured to use IP addresses explicitly and not a domain name.

He apparently had figured out some creative npx commands.\nI wanted something simpler for him.\nKnowing he had NodeJS installed, we set the path to the Angular CLI and made a custom shortcut to the NodeJS Command Prompt.\nWe followed the rabbit hole and found the Angular CLI in the following location ...\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\@angular\\cli\n\nThen, we opened the Environment Variables and added this to the Path. This ensures that we are able to reference the CLI in the command prompt later.\n\n\nThen, we located the NodeJS Command Prompt shortcut ...\nC:\\Program Files\\nodejs\n\nWe then copied the shortcut and placed it on the desktop to make things a bit easier.\nThe biggest change we made to the shortcut was to set the \"Start In\" folder to the root of his projects folder ... we got to these settings by Right-Clicking and selecting Properties.\n\nThis simple setup gave him much more flexibility without any hassles for Angular development using the CLI.",

          "description": "Si tuviese que elegir un primer tema a la hora de hablar de arquitectura de software lo tendr√≠a claro: Inversi√≥n de la dependencia. Este concepto no es nuevo y sin embargo son pocos los que lo aplican en su c√≥digo. En este art√≠culo me gustar√≠a explicar este concepto de la forma m√°s sencilla posible y poner ejemplos que faciliten su comprensi√≥n.\nAntes de entrar en materia es importante definir una serie de conceptos que nos permitir√°n entender correctamente en que consiste el la inversi√≥n de la dependencias.\nAbstracci√≥n (del lat√≠n abstrahere, 'alejar, sustraer, separar') es una operaci√≥n mental destinada a aislar conceptualmente una propiedad o funci√≥n concreta de un objeto, y pensar qu√© es, ignorando otras propiedades del objeto en cuesti√≥n.\nDetalle es una parte, hecho o circunstancia que ‚Ä¶",

          "description": "When reviewing software with which you have little experience, it's pretty common to attempt to compare it to software you have used before. That can help you get a handle on the general ergonomics and decisions behind the two pieces of software in question. However, one thing that this approach is not particularly good at is comparing the new software in situ. You may have spent a good amount of time investigating, researching, and getting comfortable with the software you're already using in the context of your particular use case, so much so, that it may even be the best solution available in that context. Comparing a new software in that context (unless it, too, is purpose-built for that context) can do a disservice to the software under test, as well as to your ability to fully unders‚Ä¶",

After I let it sit for a while, I realized that this might be possible by using the Google Analytics Data API (which I only discovered in research for this feature).\nTo follow along, you'll need at least some knowledge about building a backend server (could be in any language or framework, but I used TypeScript in combination with NestJS) and some general API knowledge.\nYou'll also need to integrate Google Analytics into your website, but you probably guessed that already. (I also won't show that part here)\nThe code that I used to get the feature working, you can find in this repository.

In this one we create a new NextJs project for client's side, make a homepage, add a new model for services and a way to manage them in the admin panel. Enjoy :).\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  A tip from the video: snippets.\n\n\nFor some reason I was very reluctant to make my own snippets. A mean I used build-in ones, or the ones that come with extensions, but I never made my own. Until recently I was using css modules and I got really tired typing import for my styles.\nSo I decided to give it a shot. Turns out even if it does not save you tons of time, I mean typing is like 1% of programming, it surely makes you feel better. So I guess my advice is if you get annoyed about typing something over and over, consider turning that thing into a snippet.\nAnd here is that css modules snippet I was talking about for VS Code.\n{\n  \"Import css module\": \n  {\n    \"prefix\": \"mcss\",\n    \"body\": [\n      \"import styles from ./$TM_FILENAME_BASE.module.css'\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",
