          "description": "This post illustrates deployment process of Server Side Rendered Angular application, as can be guessed from the title.\nThough, AWS has a dedicated service for deploying SSR applications, called  AWS Amplify, but, as of writing this post, Angular Universal is not supported by Amplify. There are multiple other options available to achieve the required result. One of the more popular ones were the usage of a third party API, called Serverless. But, It was particularly challenging for me to find a clean and vanilla solution as I was juggling between different options.\nBelow, I will demonstrate the usage of AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy Angular SSR.     \nOpen AWS Management Console and go to Elastic Beanstalk homepage. Click on Create Application.\n\nNext, Give your application a name, and select Platform and Platform branch as illustrated below.\n\nOn the same page, proceed with uploading the zipped dist folder of your Angular app which gets generated upon building your app in the local system. Now, click on Configure more options button. \n\nOn the next screen, click on the Edit button on the software tile.\n  \nProvide the Node Command considering dist as root. The path used in Node Command generally is of the folder where file to be run is placed.\n\nSave the Configuration and click on Create App subsequently. Environment setup will take a few minutes, after which it will provide the Health status, logs and Deployment URL, as, can be seen below.\n\nHope, This article is useful for the readers.

Gartner defines the Access Management market as: \"The access management (AM) market is defined by customers’ needs to establish, enforce, and manage run-time access controls for internal and external types of identities, as well as machine identities, interacting with cloud, modern standards-based web and legacy web applications\" Auth0 focuses on SaaS-delivered developer-centric and Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) use cases.\nFor more information, please download the full 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management report.\n\nThe Magic Quadrant recognized Okta (Auth0) as a Leader based on our Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision.  \nAuth0 believes that CIAM should do more to balance the three forces of security, privacy and convenience — not just keeping the bad actors out, but also driving customer loyalty and conversion and revenue to create a great experience for our customers, partners, and their end-users.\nWe believe vendors' experience in the space is a key consideration for Gartner in their Magic Quadrant Evaluations. As stated by one of our customers in their review of Auth0, included in the 2021 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer Access Management Report, Auth0 comes with great features out-of-the-box. We went live easily with Auth0 as our Identity Provider.

Suddenly, in the midst of hiring and onboarding, we found ourselves transitioning to a remote-first organization. \nHypergrowth is hard. It’s even harder when a company that values in-person interactions tries to go remote in the middle of a pandemic. \nTo be successful, we needed to spearhead two initiatives. The …",

To be fair, I had the advantage of being the person who put that bug there in the first place... But still the ability to glean information from a stack trace, even an obfuscated one, is a serious skill.\nThe stack trace in question was a ClassNotFoundException, that's typically pretty easy and already tells you everything you need to know. The class isn't there.Why it isn't there is really a matter of what we did wrong.

From time to time, emails purporting to be from Facebook or your bank drift into your inbox and insist you “verify your account.” Look closer and you spot the telltale signs of a scam: a sketchy-looking sender address, sloppy writing, and a complete lack of personalization. You sigh and hit delete.\nIt’s easy to be cynical about opportunistic, mass-mailed phishing attempts. Although some look genuine to even the most cautious eye, others feel decidedly amateurish and are readily identifiable.

Despite most organizations' desire to be \"data-driven\", much of the quality storytelling we do remains anecdotal and story driven.\nOn the one hand, quantifying abstract concepts like \"maturity\", \"quality\", or \"maintainability\" is problematic. On the other hand, quantifiable metrics like \"time-to-hello-world\" and \"uptime percentile\" don't describe the health of an API ecosystem or whether improvement efforts are improving the speed and safety of overall API development.\nI joined Postman in April, just as the company was preparing its latest survey. I saw it as an opportunity to build upon existing industry devops insights by testing whether they also apply to API program performance.\nIn the 180th Net #API Notes, I deep dive on the Postman 2021 State of the APIs Report; specifically, what are the four behaviors of high-performing API teams? And how do we measure them? \nMore in the newsletter:\nhttps://tinyletter.com/NetAPINotes/letters/net-api-notes-for-2021-11-04-issue-180-state-of-the-api-report",

          "description": "One of the simplest ways to have a rough idea of how long a piece of code is taking to execute is by using the console methods time, timerLog, and timeEnd. \nExample:\nconsole.time(\"answer time\");\n// where `answer time` is a label to identify this timer\nalert(\"Click to continue\");\nconsole.timeLog(\"answer time\");\nalert(\"Do a bunch of other stuff...\");\nconsole.timeEnd(\"answer time\");\n\nMost of the time you just want to time a whole event and don't care about intermediate steps, though. Then, you just need console.time, console.timeEnd. \nThat's pretty much it.",

The problem is that it is unlikely that every user will be comfortable with your app when it isn’t in a language that they use on a daily basis. This is where internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10) comes in.\nThe act of localizing an app is a common problem because of the dynamic nature, which stops tools like Google Translate from working. Therefore a large wealth of internationalization tools exists solves the problem in various ways, but in this tutorial I am going to showcase inlang which is a way to ensure type safety in your translations so you never miss a translation again.\nIf you would rather just give it a try without committing to a full project, give our in…",

          "description": "In this article we are going to talk about the differences between Javascript and Typescript, they are two languages that are widely use nowadays in all types of projects, JS was the first to be introduced as client-side language. As time passed the projects were JS was being used started to be too complex and heavy, thats were TS enters the game, and starts as language to resolve all the problems that JS was having at the moment, nowadays TS is a language widely used also and is becoming bigger and bigger, so I hope that with this article I can help you a little bit to now any differences or to resolve any doubts.\n\nThere are many differences, now I'm going to show you a comprehensible list of differences.\nJS is used for client-side mostly while TS is used mostly for both client-side and server-side.\nTS has an improved readability, since JS requires a lot of manual detection of bugs and errors, this has been improved a lot by TS.\nTS has static typing while JS doesn't support it since JS is a dynamically-typed language.\nTS supports ES6.\nTS has a full support in modern IDE.\nTS can also convert its code to JS if necessary.\nUsing TS means that you can use OOP(Object-oriented programming) principles.\nIn JS functions are considered an object and they can have its own method and properties.\nThe choice is up to you at the end on what to choose if you want to work with this languages, you will have to balance the pros and the cons between both of them, and make an educated choice. Usually the option you choose will come from different variables like having in mind the size and complexity of the project you are going to work on, there are more differences between this two languages but the ones I wrote are the main ones and the important ones, I hope you like the article, any queries feel free to comment and ask!",

Javascript works well for prototyping but becomes frustrating when you return to a project again. Suddenly, you see blocks of code where you can't understand what kind of data passes there.\nIn this article, I want to introduce you to Typescript while playing with code. Thus, you see it in action and don't overflow with an unnecessary theory. I recommend playing with the code you'll meet here in Typescript Playground.\nImagine you want to count items, which have the field meta that contains the field countable set to true, in an array. If an item doesn't have meta.countable, we don't count it.\nfunction getAmount (arr: any[]…",
