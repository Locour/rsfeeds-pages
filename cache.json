          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

          "description": "This is a short post going over how reactive design can help you manage data sanitization issues using just javascript. There are no plugins for this, its plain ol' js. The observable class is custom. I've been building out my Send Newdz Client for my project (https://github.com/yugely/SendNewdz).\nI wanted to take some time from doing that to just give a quick tutorial on doing some reactive programming with js, as it is a bit of a different concept than other languages and observables. I'm not using rxjs as I'm not dealing with module import problems. So I have to build it on my own. Luckily it's easy.\nCode:\nclass Observable { //custom\n    constructor(functionObserved) {\n      this._functionObserved = functionObserved\n    }\n    subscribe(observer) {\n      return this._functionObserved(observer)\n    }\n}\nlet\n myObservable = new Observable((observer) => {//create observable\n    setTimeout(() => {//timeout function\n      observer.next(demoArray)//data being passed in, next is custom type\n      observer.complete() //complete is custom type\n    }, 100)\n })\n\n//make array\nvar demoArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\n\n//create sanitize function \nlet sanitize = {\n    next(demoArray) {//sanitize\n        if (demoArray.length < 10) {\n            //throw new Error(\"The array is less than 10\")\n           throw new Error(\"The array is less than 10\")\n        }\n    },\n  complete: () => {\n      //complete if sanitized\n        console.log(\"sanitized\")\n    }\n  }\n  myObservable.subscribe(sanitize)//startprocess\n\nIt's commented out to explain it. Basically instead of observing a variable change, you observer functions to change data.",

Let go!\nFirst init our project by running npm init -y on our terminal, it'll create a package.json file. Then let's install these packages by running the following command on our terminal\nnpm i typescript ts-node express @types/node @types/express\n\ntypescript is the core package for typescript, ts-node is the node version for runnig .ts files just as we do with node app.js, in this case we do, ts-node app.ts. @types/node and @types/express has all the types for node and express respectively. You say why? Well typescript is all about type na :)\nNow let's install some helping dev stuff\nnpm i --D nodemon ts-node-dev\n\nts-node-dev package binds nodemon with typescript. The typescript version for nodemon app.js is ts-node-dev app.ts\nNow let's update our package.json file\n  ....keep others unchanged\n  \"main\": \"app.ts\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"ts-node app.ts\",\n    \"dev\": \"ts-node-dev app.ts\"\n  },\n  ...keep others unchanged\n\nRun the following command, it'll will create a tsconfig.json file.\ntsc --init\n\nLet's create an express App\nimport express, { Request, Response } from 'express';\nimport path from 'path';\n\n\n\n\n// -------------------firing express app\nconst app = express();\napp.use(express.json());\napp.use(express.urlencoded({extended:false}));\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'client/build')));\n\n\n\n\n// -------------------routes\napp.get('/home', (request: Request, response: Response)=>{\n  console.log(request.url)\n  response.json({ message: `Welcome to the home page!` })\n});\n\n\n\n// --------------------Listen\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;\napp.listen(5000, ()=>{\n  console.log(`Server running on PORT ${ PORT }`);\n})\n\nYippie, our very first typescript express app is ready. Let's run and test it\nType either npm start or npm run dev and then go to the localhost:5000 and test it out yourself. Enjoy!",

Perhaps you have an existing API server and you wish to enable it to serve some front end.

You know which sources to trust when you are reading information on social media, yes, we are talking about verified accounts on social media. In-order to minimize the continuously exploding phishing frauds in the inbox, Certifying Authorities have taken an initiative to issue verified mark certificates for brands to show their brand logo in the email inbox.\nTo make this challenging task a reality Google announced full support for the movement. This functionality will use BIMI standards (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) to show the verification mark within email clients.\nBIMI provides a secure, global framework enabling email inboxes to display sender-designated logos for authenticated messages. It also includes protections to prevent senders from spoofing logos owned by other organizations\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of BIMI? \nBIMI offers several important benefits to end users as well as to marketers across the globe.\nBIMI can reduce the amount of phishing activities.\nIt offers improved email security by using existing email authentication technologies like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.\nProvides a great opportunity for every marketers email to get read first because of logo recall.\nBIMI increases the confidence in the mind of a recipient as they see a verified logo against the sender name.\nWhat are Verified Mark Certificates ?\nVerified Mark Certificate in Action\n\nHow to get Verified Mark Certificates?\nAs of now Google & the BIMI group has not rolled out any specific date of its implementation. As per Google the pilot testing has started and will be made live for all by the end of 2020. An organization would require getting VMCs to show BIMI standard logos.\nIn case you would like to register for BIMI and want numerous VMC then contact us.

          "description": "Continuing from the last post. We didn't alter the global variable value, but the function incrementer would not work without the global variable fixedValue being there.\n\n\nAnother principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.\n\n\nThere are several good consequences from this principle. The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, and it won't depend on anything else in your program. This can give you more confidence when you alter, remove, or add new code. You would know what you can or cannot change and you can see where the potential traps are.\n\n\nFinally, the function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it.\n\n\nLet's update the incrementer function to clearly declare its dependencies. Let's write the incrementer function so it takes an argument, and then returns a result after increasing the value by one.\n\n\n\n\nvar fixedValue = 4;\n\nfunction incrementer () {\n\n};\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n\n\nvar fixedValue = 4;\n\nfunction incrementer (num) {\nreturn num + 1;\n\n};\n\nconsole.log(incrementer(5));\n\nThe function incrementer did not change the value of fixedValue and the function also took an argment num.",

Unfortunately, splice changes the original array it is called on, so the second call to it used a modified array, and gave unexpected results.\n\n\nOne of the core principles of functional programming is to not change things. Changes lead to bugs. It's easier to prevent bugs knowing that your functions don't change anything, including the function arguments or any global variable.\n\n\nLet's try to master this discipline and not alter any variable or object in our code.\n\n\nLet's fill in the code for the function incrementer so it returns the value of the global variable fixedValue increased by one.\n\n\n\n\nvar fixedValue = 4;\n\nfunction incrementer () {\n\n}\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n\n\nvar fixedValue = 4;\n\nfunction incrementer () {\n  return fixedValue + 1;\n}\n\nconsole.log(fixedValue); will display 4\nconsole.log(incrementer()); will display 5;\n\nThe function incrementer did not change the value of fixedValue(which is 4). and incrementer function should returned a value that is one larger than the fixedValue value.",

But before we get there, let's look at an imperative approach to programming to highlight where you may have issues.\nAn imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task. Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. A classic example is writing a for loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.\nIn contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming.

I created a couple of reusable artifacts and it in a way became a base for my second YouTube channel.\nThings kept breaking, and I found myself spending more time on fixing things than I expected, even with my prior experience with Linux before I spent four years on macOS.\n\n\n\n\nSo I started looking out for alternatives and found the exact thing I was looking for.\nI couldn't lose the control I had over my Linux setup back with Arch by delegating it to a graphical installer. So I installed Debian in the way we usually do install Arch.\n\n\n\n\nAll this learning had to be documented somewhere so I created another video talking about the process in a little bit of detail.\nMoving to Debian meant re-setting up the entire machine, even deeper than what I had to do back when I moved the factory-installed Windows to a smaller partition to make space for my primary Linux partition.\n\n\n\n\nThe new setup took away a few issues I never got fixed, and in exchange, brought with it a few other ones. I talked about the similarities, differences, negatives, and most importantly, the positives of the migration in a separate video, adding another episode to my series Back to Linux.\nAs I did last time, I'll keep my eyes open for ways to improve my setup and workflow, and will keep documenting my learning to be able to share them with the rest of the community.\nNeedless to say, I'm loving the alternate universe with Debian. Do throw in your ideas and thoughts in the comments and hopefully, we can learn something from each other.",

          "description": "Introduction\n\n\nMost of us have come across terms like multithreading, parallel processing, multiprocessing, concurrency, etc., though each of these terms has its own meaning. In a broader sense, we need these because we want to avoid some kind of latency (or have an illusion of doing so) in the execution of regular programs.\nTo do this, we try to write code that doesn’t necessarily runs in order (non-sequential) and all this boils down to two different concepts — concurrency and parallelism.\nI came across concurrency when I was trying to download ~5000 images from the web. I had collected image URLs from Flickr, and these images had to be passed on to a team doing annotation (labelling).\nThis is how a sequential program to download images would look like:\nimport requests\n\ndef download_imag…",

Hearing of Fedora thirty-four which has just officially launched, doing a fresh install of the operating system (OS) had been emerging in my mind, all the time. But how could clean installation clean up the mess? Nay, that is not possible! Once I got my hands dirty, everything will not be alright. Consequently, I have thoughts of keeping myself away from messing around for this time.\nAs many of people in many different communities have mentioned what is new in the thirty-four edition, followed by how-tos when installing Fedora for the first time, or even again, I have nothing more to share.

One of these greeters is the previously known as lightdm webkit2 greeter, then named lightdm web greeter, a greeter that allows theming with web technologies like HTML and JavaScript.\nSadly, this greeter was abandoned as Antergos team didn’t have time to develop their distro. The latest version, 2.2.5 uses an outdated WebKit engine, which could cause some new web technologies to not work in the greeter. Also, the Debian package is not working, a shame.\nLuckily, Antergos team were developing a 3.0.0 version, getting rid of WebKit and using the QtWebEngine, based on Chromium, with Python. So, I decided to update some things about this greeter based on this pre-release.\nWhither is the “new” tool that 3.0.0 would be using, developed by Antergos, allows to create web applications in a similar way to Electron.js, but in Python.\nSo, I’m here to introduce a new pre-release. You can install it from the GitHub Repository. Though, you need to install the whither sdk to run it.\nCommand line arguments support, such as —-help, —-theme, —-debug and others\nSome fixes with the LightDM API, as power functions didn’t work\nMan pages updated\nEvery local request is made through web-greeter:/ url scheme\nWebKit no longer here. Replaced with Chromium\nSome API changes. 2.2.5 deprecated functions and globals were removed\nIf you are using LightDM, I recommend you to use this greeter, try some themes and create your own!\nUse the Glorious theme by Manilarome~ It’s glorious.",

I appreciate all feedback and constructive feedback is the most helpful.\nThroughout my career as a developer I have heard a lot of people agree that testing our code is something that we should all be doing. Conversely, I have not worked at many places that actually do it. Additionally, and surprisingly to me, rarely if ever do you see a tutorial show any kind of testing when they're trying to teach something unless they're specifically teaching testing.\nWhile I understand that the focus of the lesson may not be testing, I think that if we really want to see testing adopted more widely across our industry then we…",

MEAN is used by several Web App Development Companies, and it precisely stands for “MongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js.”\nHow does Mean stack architecture work?\n\nThe Mean Stack Architecture works in five stages.\nStage 1: Angular as a client-side language is the foremost one to work on the client request.\nStage 2: The client request then goes into NodeJS being the JavaScript server-side language.\nStage 3: ExpressJS is then into the process and makes a database request.\nStage 4: Then MongoDB retrieves the data and sends the response to ExpressJS.\nStage 5: NodeJS returns the data to the AngularJS to showcase the outcomes, and in return, the data is taken back from the ExpressJS.\n20 reasons to use MEAN stack for web & mobile app development project\n1) Free & open-source stack\nIf you want to read more about all reasons then visit Why Use MEAN Stack for Web & Mobile App Development Project?",

It is an extensive component library primarily made for React.

Let go!\nFirst init our project by running npm init -y on our terminal, it'll create a package.json file. Then let's install these packages by running the following command on our terminal\nnpm i typescript ts-node express @types/node @types/express\n\ntypescript is the core package for typescript, ts-node is the node version for runnig .ts files just as we do with node app.js, in this case we do, ts-node app.ts. @types/node and @types/express has all the types for node and express respectively. You say why? Well typescript is all about type na :)\nNow let's install some helping dev stuff\nnpm i --D nodemon ts-node-dev\n\nts-node-dev package binds nodemon with typescript. The typescript version for nodemon app.js is ts-node-dev app.ts\nNow let's update our package.json file\n  ....keep others unchanged\n  \"main\": \"app.ts\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"ts-node app.ts\",\n    \"dev\": \"ts-node-dev app.ts\"\n  },\n  ...keep others unchanged\n\nRun the following command, it'll will create a tsconfig.json file.\ntsc --init\n\nLet's create an express App\nimport express, { Request, Response } from 'express';\nimport path from 'path';\n\n\n\n\n// -------------------firing express app\nconst app = express();\napp.use(express.json());\napp.use(express.urlencoded({extended:false}));\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'client/build')));\n\n\n\n\n// -------------------routes\napp.get('/home', (request: Request, response: Response)=>{\n  console.log(request.url)\n  response.json({ message: `Welcome to the home page!` })\n});\n\n\n\n// --------------------Listen\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;\napp.listen(5000, ()=>{\n  console.log(`Server running on PORT ${ PORT }`);\n})\n\nYippie, our very first typescript express app is ready. Let's run and test it\nType either npm start or npm run dev and then go to the localhost:5000 and test it out yourself. Enjoy!",

So you, reader, would understand where I coming from.\nDX - developer experience. UX - user experience, usability.\nUsing <button> instead of <div> for a clickable elements is a good for UX (and accessibility). Yet a lot of front-end developers keep using divs or spans or something else. Why is that?\nMy guess is that because it is much easier to work with div then button, because div doesn’t have built in styles.
