I started a site that is a network for developers to seek & give advice over video chat. \nhttps://p-pl.com is the site\nFor instance, if you are an expert in React.js, you can have other people connect with you. You as an expert can also bill for your time. (Hourly rate)\nOr if you're seeking advice, you can search for and request to connect with other users that are online at that given moment. If they accept the call, you are immediately brought to the video chat portal to hash out your code issues or anything else.\nOnce the interaction ends, each user can rate eachother based on professionality, expertise etc. Think of it almost like an uber for information.\nYou as a user are ranked higher in the results based on your reviews as well as the meta data your provide in your profile.\nThis was a 2 1/2 year project and I just want it in the right hands. I will be posting tutorials later on how to use the site, core features etc.\nWhat I'm looking to do is build the network full of JavaScript developers so that the community is rich with support in this language.

You can't measure how many times it passed or failed because those numbers have nothing to do with providing value.\nThe best way that everyone on an engineering team, including management/leadership, can see the value gained is by using Value Stream Management (VSM).\nIn this blog post, you'll learn what VSM is, why it's important, and a few tools to take a look at.\nLet's think of a few things that engineers do (this is by all means not an exhaustive list.

This is also an article on K8s, so bear with me.\nAn application program (app or application for short) is a computer program designed to carry out a specific task typically to be used by end users.\nContainers are a form of virtualization of operating systems. They are software executable units in which application code, together with its dependencies and configurations, is packed in such a manner that it may be run on any environment.\nThink of containers like the work machines/laptops that can enable employees to be independent and deliver services effectively. They are portable, enable the employee to work from home or office, and have all the resources the employee needs to complete the tasks. They are also isolated, so the employee is not influenced by what others run on their machines.\nTo understand how Kubernetes works, we must familiarise ourselves with images.\nImages can be related to the guide or manual which one uses for getting the work machine started. Or, think of it as the blueprint for creating a work machine in the first place :).\nIn the coming parts, we will explore how to get started with docker images and containers.\nThanks for reading!",

When we run curl https://example.com/script.sh | bash the bash process started is non-interactive and expects no human input.

I frequently end up with \"login failed for token-identified-principal\" after being connected for only a few minutes. This makes using Azure Data Studio an exercise in frustration, wondering what combination of operations will result in ADS just conking out on you until your token expires.\nAzure SQL doesn't support the standard T-SQL BACKUP and RESTORE commands, so getting a copy of your database for local development is somewhat challenging. The Azure Portal requires the AAD admin credentials, not something I want to give out to developers. Enter SqlPackage, which I have started preferring to both the Azure portal and ADS. SqlPackage for Linux is available at https://aka.ms/sqlpackage-linux.\nA first attempt at copying the database from Azure might look like this:\nsqlpackage /a:export /scs:\"Data Source=...Initial Catalog=...\" /ua:true /tid:\"mytenant.onmicrosoft.com\"\nIndeed, that's what I attempted. But UniversalAuthentication (required to authenticate with MFA) doesn't seem to work as expected on Linux. You would expect that a browser would be launched to login to the application (since MFA won't work without a browser). However, the command above doesn't work.\nLooking through the SqlPackage help, I see that there is a /AccessToken option. We can manually obtain an access token and use it to authenticate. Access tokens can be obtained using the Azure CLI, using the command az account get-access token --resource https://database.windows.net/. This will return a JSON body containing (among other things) the access token to use. Copy and paste this into an environment variable ACCESS_TOKEN, and then the full sqlpackage invocation becomes:\nsqlpackage /a:export /at:\"$ACCESS_TOKEN\" /scs:\"Data Source=...\" /ua:True ...",

          "description": "If we use OnPush change detection strategy, immutability is helpful to ensure change detection works expectedly. \nOne of the way to enforce immutability is using Immutable.js. However, using Immutable.js is not really straightforward. It adds another layer instead of using JS object directly e.g\nconst apps = List([{ name: 'slack' }, { name: 'skype' }]);\napps.get(0); // { name: 'slack' }\n\nconst app = Map({ name: 'slack' });\nmap.get(\"name\"); // 'slack'\n\n// Using Record if we want to access property directly\nconst AppRecord = Record({\n    name: ''\n});\n\nclass App extends AppRecord {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n    }\n}\n\nconst newApp = new App({ name: 'slack' });\nnewApp.name; // 'slack'\n\nWe have to use get when using List and Map. Using Record could solve the issue, but if we have a very large object, using Record will be hard to maintain because we need to create each record per object and it's nested object.\nOther issue is about JS compatibility because it needs to use fromJS and toJS methods to convert from and to JS object. \nI'd say that I'm not a fan of that lib and it makes things more complicated. \nOther possible approach I'm thinking of: \nreadonly + ESLint immutable\n\n\nSince Angular using Typescript, let's use Readonly<T>, ReadonlyArray to enforce immutability. \nAlso add this no-mutation ESLint rule as extra protection https://github.com/jonaskello/eslint-plugin-functional/blob/master/docs/rules/immutable-data.md\nis there any better approach? \nThank you",

We will be presenting some \"spooky\" code challenges that will allow you to dig deeper into the TypeScript language in a fun way.\nStarting right now, a new code challenge will be posted every weekday, along with its solution the day after. The last solution will be posted on the weekend.\nIn order to participate you only need to be able to access the TypeScript website. Though ideally, you share with us your answers via our dev.to blog post mirrors, here, or via Twitter to @TypeScript.\nYou will want to start here on the blog to find the details on the code challenges for the day. Each post contains 2 links to different challenges which run in the TypeScript playground. Via the playground,…",

          "description": "It's time to talk about it... Not Next, nor Nuxt, but Nest!\nSome time ago, I challenged myself to build a robust backend solution in JavaScript. Many developers believe that JavaScript isn't secure enough, efficient or simply organized to manage data through APIs. I'll convince you otherwise....\nFor this new project, I chose technologies that are on the rise, in particular PostgreSQL but especially NestJS. So, I gave up my good old database that is MongoDB, in favor of a more traditional database.\nNB: I was a little bit rusty at first, but going back to relational database was a real good idea; if only to retrieve data from several tables in one call, unlike NoSQL which requires as many calls as there are documents to query... Finally, SQL is like riding a bike, it's unforgettable 😉\nNestJ…",

          "description": "Privacy and transparency are some of the most important requirements that most modern social networks like Facebook and Instagram do not meet. \nOne of the best examples of privacy nightmare is TikTok. It collects some very troubling data points such as the number of CPUs your device has, available disk space, your IP & MAC addresses, whether your phone is jailbroken, and so much more, which does not have anything to do with TikTok. Imagine that there are so many more applications and websites that do essentially the same thing and sell your information to 3rd party advertisers. Internet is rapidly becoming a place where one company can easily predict what type of person you are, based on all data points that they collected over time.\nTo end this, I have open-sourced the social network that I was working on for more than a year! It is called Polygon and the main goal for it is to be a social network that is not hungry for your data. Both the core and front-end are written in TypeScript and are seeking support from the open-source community. We also have a hosting guide that is written in Python.There is also some tooling written in Go. My main goal is to make it a private, easy-to-use, and crisp social network which will be adapted by privacy and open-source enthusiasts all over the world. \nPolygon is also open for Hacktoberfest contributions, which means that both beginners and professionals can contribute to the project and learn something new!\nYou can find all projects related to Polygon at: https://github.com/polygon-isecure\nThank you!",
