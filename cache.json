Companies must have the skill and expertise required to create such apps. Stacks of technologies are as follows:\nAndroid/iOS mobile app stacks\nSwift\nBackend/API Stack\nRedis\nWebsite Stack\nNode.js\nDeveloping each of the features above will take a certain amount of time. For an idea of how many hours the basic functionality of a dating app like Tinder needs to be programmed on iOS and Android, check out the table below.\nAuthorization - 22 hours \nThe above are all approximations of the time it would take for a function to be developed. You can increase the functions of your dating app at a cost but also increase the development time. If you know the total time required for development, you can calculate what it will cost by checking the hours charged by the developer. \nThe location of the team should also be taken into account. You should prepare to double the cost of an app if you hire someone to build it in the USA or Western Europe. Conversely, developers in Eastern Europe can create the same app for a much lower cost.\nTherefore, development of an app like Tinder the requires a specialized team. If you're building a Tinder clone, your team should probably include:\n2 Backend developers\nWrapping It Up!!\nAll of the data above tells us clearly that the popularity of dating apps is growing and that a decline in such amazing apps is not expected in the future. Whenever you plan to develop a dating app, decide on the essential feature first. Depending on how long each feature is going to take, you can estimate the development costs. For that intent on building their dating app like Tinder, seek guidance from a company with experience and expertise. Hiring experienced developers is necessary to make a user-friendly and market-ready app in the first go.",

Any write to a linux local filesystem is done 'buffered', unless explicitly defined it not to, which is done by opening the file with the O_DIRECT flag. So all file interactions from the shell likely are done buffered, and the Postgresql database is also using buffered IO.\nWhat happens when you perform a buffered write is that you don't actually write to the disk, but instead you write to memory. Because currently the latency of most disk IO/writes is still much higher than memory IO latency (~ 25us/modern SSD vs 160ns/memory, although very configuration specifi…",

          "description": "If you're into Typescript and prefer a code-first approach when working with databases, you'll be happy to learn about Prisma! Prisma is a next-generation Node.js and TypeScript ORM, that allows you to define a schema using a dedicated DSL so that you can then have all the comforts of modern development environments like intellisense, static type checking, automatic scaffolding and more.\nTo help everyone, even those who just started working as coders - or those who want to start a career as software engineers - we have created a fully working end-to-end full-stack solution that has:\na frontend written with Vue.Js\n\na backend, written in Typescript and using Prisma\n\nan Azure SQL database (for the reasons explained here)\nto make it consumable by really everyone, we also decided to support both REST and GraphQL protocols and we also decided to make sure that everyone can take advantage of a streamlined CI/CD experience, so we used Azure Static Web Apps and GitHub Actions to glue everything together.\nLast, but not least, the sample also support Authentication and Authorization (which is super simple thanks to Azure Static Web Apps!)\nI must say I'm happy and proud of what has been done, as this example is a great learning experience and starting point for everyone interested in becoming a better developer.\nSo, look at the article here to learn more about Prisma:\nModern application development with Prisma, GraphQL (or REST) and Azure SQL\nand to the repository hear to deploy the code on your own:\n / \n        azure-sql-db-prisma\n      \n    \nThe repository is fully documented. You should be easily able to set up your working environment in no time. If you want to see it in action and learn about it before starting to use it, I did a session at the Prima Meetup that you can watch here:\n\n\n\n\nAs usual, enjoy!",

If you haven't done it yet, checkout part one ! \nIn part one, we used a strong programming pattern to model our funnel: a state machine. We also built a FunnelProvider that provides us with a flexible api to synchronize it with React. \nToday we'll implement the actual steps of the funnel and see how we can update our state machine to store the data entered by the customer at each step. \nAs always the code we'll write in this article is fully available here. However if you feel like coding along you can start from where we left off by cloning the repository from part 1\nAs we did last time, let's start with a bit of state machine theory !

If that means nothing, read on and hopefully, by the end it makes sense! TypeScript builds on JavaScript to add variable types (like you see in Rust, C++ or Java), making it easier to spot mistakes in your code. Adding types to TypesScript code can get old quickly! GraphQL is a typed language which means you just have to reference the GraphQL schema in the right way to be able to generate types automatically for your TypeScript code base.\nUsing the graphql-codegen tool, we will see how you can generate a single file containing all the types from the GraphQL API you are using. Then when you run a query, you will just need to import the type from that file. If you a…",
