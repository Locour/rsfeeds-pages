These are the ways most of the developers prefer.\nReact and NodeJS\n\nThe first way is having a single server that serves both Node API and React SPA under same domain. Here data is still exchanged through JSON. As you can see in the above picture, all the routes which do not start with /api will be handled by React SPA.\nCORS errors🥶.\nCopy build folder files from react app and paste them in public folder of NodeJS server.\nNow server the static index.html which in the public folder\n\n\n\n\napp.use(express.static(path.join('public')));\napp.use((req,res) => {\n   res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html'));\n});\n\nSingle server.\nNo more CORS errors 😅\nIdeal for small applications.\nAs both frontend and backend will be handled by the same server, you may face performance issues.\n\nAs we use two different servers for backend and frontend, we get better performance.\nIdeal for bigger applications.\nHave to maintain two different servers.\nThe third way and the least preferred way is server-side rendering with template engines like ejs, handlebars, pugjs etc... Here we don't create any REST API.\nSo, what other ways you know and what is your preferred way? Comment below 👇\nHope this helps you!\nTwitter and LinkedIn. Follow me for more 😃.",

For this you have to know basic Linux Command, Shell syntax & Manual of Date command.\nSo Let's Accomplished the Task ! (bold text are command).\nIf you want to create a delay in program we always use sleep Command an if you want to echo-back the command we always use $(date). But if you have requirement to remove a new-line in terminal we have -n option in echo. or If you have some other requirement to do operations like New-line, Backspace & Tabulation. Then we have a options called -e stand for Sequence and you have to pass a sequence Character in string\nFor Example :-\n    echo -e \"Hello\\nWorld\" = To add a New-line.\n    echo -e \"Hello\\bWorld\" = To Backspace a letter.\n    echo -e \"Hello\\tWorld\" = To add a Tabulation.\n\nAfter know this syntax we are able to create live running time Clock. So let's begin .\necho $(date +%r) = It will give the output of this date command format.\necho -e \"$(date +%r)\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\" = It will backspace the output (if command not work use below one).\necho -n  -e \"$(date +%r)\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\" = It will backspace the output (Why we have to do this you will know in a minute).\necho -n  -e \"$(date +%r)\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\" = It will backspace all the output of command.\necho -n  -e \"$(date +%r)$(sleep 1)\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\" = It will add 1s delay in command.\nNow we have to add this thing in Loop. So it will keep on running .\nWhile :\n    > do\n    > echo -n  -e \"`date +%r``sleep 1`\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\"\n    > done\n\nNow you will see the magic here the command is keep on running (Tick Tock).\nIf you want to save this command for some project like when creating your own module that time this mite be useful for you, So select a command and copy and create a file you can give any name and past it and save the file. To execute this file you can use bash filename.",

          "description": "I'm trying to understand the Angular terms and philosophy. One of the most basic building blocks of Angular seems to be a directive.\nThe Angular glossary says that \"A [directive is a] class that can modify the structure of the DOM or modify attributes in the DOM and component data model\".\nSeems VueJS also has the concept of directive.\ndirective is some special token in the markup that tells the library to do something to a DOM element.\"\nThis includes a reference to the AngularJS framework, and, yes, it seems AngularJS also has this term.\nAngularJS docs:  \"At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children.\"\nOk, so it seems that the term originally comes from AngularJS, and Angular and VueJS just inherited it.\nI guess, in Layman terms, a directive is a way of \"teaching the HTML to do new tricks\" (not mine). \ndirective?\nStill not sure, maybe the creators thought of this term because a directive it's like commanding (giving directives/instructions/orders) to a static technology (HTML) in order to make it smarter.",

          "description": "Recently I had to work with some automatically generated types whilst using GraphQL. This is a very extremely useful feature! However, it can be a little cumbersome to specifically reach different custom nested types from the requests without it being too verbose.\nBut, being a little creative with some native Typescript functions we can find a way to handle this exact use case!\n\nLet’s take for example this generated type (For the sake of the example, this will be a fairly simple type with a nested subtype):\nIf we wanted to extract the type of the array without it getting too verbose we could use some conditional typing from Typescript.\n\nThe following type allows us to extract it:\nIt can be a little confusing at first glance but let’s break down every portion. First, we have our ArrayElement which is a generic receiving the array itself as T.\nHere the infer keyword from typescript (which must be used with extends) to declaratively introduce a new generic type U based on the given array.\nNow let’s assume that the TStuff type is an array and we want to extract a singular TStuff. We could then supply the type of TStuff[] to ArrayElement\ntype TNestedStuff = ArrayElement<TStuff[]>;\n\nLooking at the result of the extracted type we can now use it however we wish or even assign it as its own type to make it less verbose!\n\nHere is the code sandbox to play around with the type and the Typescript documentation :\nDocumentation - Conditional Types\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/array-type-extraction-1eohh\nIf you have any other way to extract a type from an array let me know in the comments below!\nOriginally published at https://relatablecode.com on November 21, 2021.",
