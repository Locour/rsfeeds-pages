          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

I was thinking about combining a language that I started to learn (Typescript) and making easier a configuration for ExpressJS; by that moment, I did not know about NestJS, a very mature and fantastic Framework. I did not have a chance to research, just because I got the idea to start working in this new (at that moment) personal library.\nIn September 2019, that personal library turned into a microframework to help build server-side applications in NodeJS and use modern Javascript powered by Typescript.

Fortunately, we don't usually use every HTTP status code out there. There are the common ones that people use often and we can limit our knowledge to just the ones we need.\nIt would have been great if we had only codes to remember but these codes have meanings (as far HTTP is concerned). So remembering the code only is not enough, we also have to remember what they mean and when to use them. The meanings given to these codes are standard meanings, so if we aim to develop APIs that follows the HTTP standard, it is imperative we use these codes appropriately else we end up creating APIs that others can't understand or use.\nWouldn't it be nice if there was a way we can cr…",

          "description": "As video conference calls are now part of my daily life, I decided to investigate how I can look better in front of my webcam. After some research, I bought an Elgato Key Light Air to help illuminate my face better.\nSo far, I'm delighted with the purchase. The key light has definitely improved how I look on video calls. But having to turn it on every time I have a video call and then turn it off when the call ends is a pain.\nI considered leaving the light on throughout the work day, but the light can be quite searing to my eyes when it's shining at me for an extended period of time.\nI then put on my software engineering hat and wondered, \"Can I automate this inconvenience away?\". As it turns out, I can.\nThe Elgato Key Light and Key Light Air devices actually have a web server (listening on port 9123) built in. The web server exposes a REST API:\nGET /elgato/lights\n\nThis endpoint returns the status of the key light.\nSample Response\n{\n    \"numberOfLights\": 1,\n    \"lights\": [\n        {\n            \"on\": 1,\n            \"brightness\": 9,\n            \"temperature\": 262\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nFor updating the key light, there's a PUT action endpoint:\nPUT /elgato/lights\n\nContent-Type: 'application/json'\n--data-raw '{\n  \"Lights\": [\n    {\n      \"Temperature\": 344,\n      \"Brightness\": 100,\n      \"On\": 1\n    }\n  ]\n}'\n\nThis endpoint allows you to set the attributes of the key light. You can set the brightness and temperature, including turning it on or off.\nThis means that I can turn the Elgato Key Light off and on by interfacing with its REST API endpoints.\nI created  a Node.js script that toggles on and off the Elgato Key Light. I then bound the execution of the script to a keyboard macro. So now, I can tap a key to turn the Key Light on and off. :D\nIt is relatively easy for one to interface with an Elgato Key Light or Key Light Air using its built-in REST API. You can even integrate it into your smart home via something like  Homebridge .",

By doing this, I inherit a set of robust properties without having to write too much new code.\nLet’s start with the User model:\n\nIn my ToonSpace project, I create a model named “ToonUser” and add some custom properties that IdentityUser doesn’t already cover, including:\nFirstName\nLastName\nDisplayName\nFullName\nImageData\nContentType\n\nI also inherit the properties of IdentityUser by using the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity namespace and inheriting from Identity user when I name the class:\n\nWhat properties does IdentityUser grant me access to? A lot.\n\nWith these properties appended to my ToonUser, I have the tools I need to allow users to register accounts and interact with my application.\nIn my data folder, I access my ApplicationDbContext file and inherit IdentityDbContext of type ToonUser.\n\nThen I add the ToonUser to my Identity service, along with Default UI and DefaultTokenProviders.\n\nNow I’m ready to scaffold Identity pages for user accounts. I add a Scaffolded Item in my Areas > Identity folder and select “Identity.” \n\nI override all files and select ApplicationDbContext as my data context class. Once I add the scaffolded Identity pages, my Identity folder will be filled with boilerplate razor pages.\n\nI access the code behind for the “register” view and add properties for First Name and Last Name because those properties are not the default with Identity pages. I also add fields to the View for the user to enter this information.\n\nNow that I have registration pages scaffolded and augmented to fit my ToonUser model, users can register an account on my application.\nI hope these letters find you well, dearest Coder.\nUntil next time, godspeed in your keystrokes.\nClickity Clacks,\nKasey",

For example, a person's face or fingerprints are unique to them and can be measured. So they're often used to identify a person in law enforcement applications.\nBiometrics have been used for identity verification since 1883 when French criminologist Alphonse Bertillon first used body measurements to identify repeat offenders. Today, biometric authentication is growing in popularity for enterprises because biometrics are an effective way to control access to sensitive information, devices, or physical locations.\nHowever, biometrics aren't impenetrable and come with increased privacy risks.

Although it uses end-to-end encryption, it still collects more metadata on its users than other messaging applications like Signal. \nIn January 2021, news circulated that WhatsApp planned to roll out in-app notifications to users, informing an update in its Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It was up to the user to accept the new WhatsApp Privacy Policy and Terms of Service to continue to use the messaging application.\nThe company tweaked its terms of service and privacy policy which notified users once they entered the application. Users had to accept these updates to continue to use the application, and these changes were scheduled to be implemented on February 8th, 2021. The following were the updates made in terms of service and privacy policy:\nWhatsApp’s service and how we process your data\nHow businesses can use Facebook hosted services to store and \nmanage their WhatsApp chats\nHow they partner with Facebook to offer integrations across the \nFacebook Company Products\nRead the full article here:WhatsApp Privacy Policy: Everything You Need to Know",

Let’s ask an even deeper question; should application developers even be aware of Kubernetes in their infrastructure?\nI frequently hear this question being asked by DevOps, Platform Engineering, and Development teams. Of course, this is a discussion that brings very different views from different people and can result in a very long debate.\nKubernetes, without a doubt, provides far more functionality than the average developer needs. While Kubernetes is robust and provides dozens of types of objects (around 50 the last time I checked), developers don’t care how many replicas of their service are running, what roles it has, or if it’s running via StatefulSets; all they care about is getting an HTTPS endpoint that they can use to deliver their …",

When we console.log(i) we get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. \nI also created a variable result which is equal to 1 because if we put 0 there then every time we multiply it by 0 we get zero. the result variable is basically going to accumulate all of the numbers.

When your browser makes a request, the web server acts as a server (fulfilling that request)\n⦁ But when the web server requests data from the database, \nIt is acting as a client to that database—and the database is the server (because it is fulfilling the request).\nServers, Clients, Hosts :\n⦁ In a Client-Server Model, a server serves many clients.\n⦁ The Client can be (Commands line Applications, Graphical users interfaces, Web App).\n⦁ Servers and clients are programs that run on hosts.\n⦁ The server sometimes refers to both the computer and the process that serves the web app\n⦁ Hosts are computers connected over a network (like the internet!).\n⦁ The host (computer) of the web server and the database, can be the same computer.\nRequests and Responses :\n⦁ A client sends a request to the server\n⦁ The server's job is to fulfill the request with a response it sends back to the client.\n⦁ Requests and responses are served via a communication protocol, which sets up the expectations and rules for how the communication occurs between servers and clients.\nNote:\nDon't let this confuse you. \nSince a web server can do both, it sometimes acts as a server and sometimes acts as a client :).",

A temporary table stores a subset of data from a normal table for a certain period of time.\nTemporary tables are particularly useful when you have a large number of records in a table and you repeatedly need to interact with a small subset of those records. In such cases instead of filtering the data again and again to fetch the subset, you can filter the data once and store it in a temporary table. You can then execute your queries on that temporary table. Temporary tables are stored inside “tempdb” which is a system database.

A Linux distribution is an operating system, while Linux is the code that makes the operating system work (the kernel).\nThese distributions have a different user experience and target. Some distributions are very beginner orientated while others are oriented towards the power user. There are many different Linux distributions \nSome of the more popular Linux distributions are Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora and Suse. Each Linux distribution has a different target audience, such as Kali which is very security orientated.\n…",

It can even be used inside IDEs as a plugin.\nVim allows programmers to edit text quickly and efficiently. You can jump to the end of file using G, top of file using gg and to line 10 using 10G.

This approach, unless controlled, usually leads to low productivity in the long term.\nHow so you might ask ? Well, this behavior is really relatable for some people. When I am talking about this subject, some of you might probably say, \"Oh yes I have been there\". In Linux world, there is even a term for this. Ricing.\nRicing means tweaking the configuration of your working environment to suit your personal needs. At particular level, one might consider this useful, and it indeed is. There are some workflow approaches, shortcuts and others that helps the developer access files and folders faster, learn by muscle memory and perform some set of actions quicker. Past that particular level and you are now in the over-ricing zone. Where you are essentially tweaking every aspect of each program, work environment to your needs, but at the same time you are never satisfied so you keep tweaking and changing settings, configs and what not. It reduces your productivity and at the end of the day when you look back, you realize you have done nothing but tweaking some stuff to find the best work environment.\nThis is what I call the loop (referring to the Bandersnatch here). You are in the loop. You need to get out and you need to get sh*t done. Don't worry about using the best tool out there, don't try to find the absolute efficient program. Just get it done.\nThis is in actuality a paradox. The paradox goes as such, \"The more choices you have, the less satisfied you are\". Seems about right when you think for a bit.",

Actually I'm unaware why AppImages aren't already part of all Linux distros out there.

But as competition intensifies, it is necessary for companies to come up with feature-rich apps to match world-class standards and attract more people. Therefore, if you want to develop an app from scratch, the website development company\nneeds to use a consistent software stack.

I was thinking about combining a language that I started to learn (Typescript) and making easier a configuration for ExpressJS; by that moment, I did not know about NestJS, a very mature and fantastic Framework. I did not have a chance to research, just because I got the idea to start working in this new (at that moment) personal library.\nIn September 2019, that personal library turned into a microframework to help build server-side applications in NodeJS and use modern Javascript powered by Typescript.

If the result is the same every time we run the functions, then why don't we just calculate it once and save the result?\n// Don't reuse it, it is just an example\nlet memo = (func) => {\n  let cache = {}\n  return (...args) => {\n    if (cache[args]) {\n      console.log('Cache hit :)')\n      return cache[args]\n    }\n    console.log('Cache miss :(')\n    let result = func(...args)\n    cache[args] = result\n    return result\n  }\n}\n\nfunction sleep(ms) {\n  var start = new Date().getTime(), expire = start + ms;\n  while (new Date().getTime() < expire) { }\n  return;\n}\n\nlet slowAdd = (a, b) => {\n  sleep(1000)\n  return a + b\n}\n\nlet memoAdd = memo(slowAdd)\nconsole.log(memoAdd(1, 2))\n// * waiting for 1 sec *\n// Cache miss :(\n// 3\nconsole.log(memoAdd(1, 2))\n// No waiting\n// Cache hit :)\n// 3\n\nReal-life applications:\nFor example, there is React.memo which does memoization.\nIf your component renders the same result given the same props ... React will skip rendering the component, and reuse the last rendered result.\nAlso, there is a useMemo hook, which also does memoization.\nuseMemo will only recompute the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed. This optimization helps to avoid expensive calculations on every render.\nResources:\nwiki/memoization\nreact-docs\nOther posts:\nJS interview in 2 minutes / pure vs impure functions\nJS interview in 2 minutes / Closure\nJS interview in 2 minutes / Currying 🥘\nBtw, I will post more fun stuff here and on Twitter.
