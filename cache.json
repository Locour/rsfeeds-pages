You're not the only one who feels this way. The issue of online privacy is crucial.\nYou can improve your online security against unwanted access to your data and privacy by taking several simple actions.\n1 \nBrowse in private mode or use a browser, which doesn't store and send your data.\nBrowsing in private mode can let you avoid your browser's history from tracing. However, these private modes aren't entirely private. Your ISP can observe your surfing behavior even if you're using an incognito or private mode.\ne.g.\nhttps://www.brave.com/\nhttps://www.beakerbrowser.com/\n2 \nBe cautious about where you click.\nPhishing attempts are one of the ways how hackers can compromise your online privacy. They frequently accomplish this by sending fake emails that look like from banks, credit card companies, etc. \n3 \nChange your search engine.\nIf you're like most web users, you use Google as your primary search engine.\ne.g.\nhttps://www.duckduckgo.com/\nhttps://www.startpage.com/\n4\nUse dedicated proxy servers. \nA dedicated proxy server acts as a private and secure connection point between users and the internet. It's a server that acts as an \"intermediary\" between end-users and the web pages they browse on the internet. An IP address is used when a computer connects to the internet.\nYou can compare it to your home's street address. It directs data to the appropriate destination while also providing a return address for other devices.\nA dedicated proxy server is a machine connected to the internet that has its unique IP address and serves as a disguise for your computer.\nThere are plenty of companies that provide such services, here is my personal top of the most reliable ones:\nhttps://www.dslrentals.com/\nhttps://www.proxy-hub.com/\nStay safe=)",

Theft attempt and other security threats can be controlled by using this simple circuit.\nFor the purpose of this application, we will design a security system for one room in a house. The sensor used for each opening can be either a mechanical switch, a magnetically operated switch, or an optical sensor. Detection of an intrusion can be used to initiate an audible alarm signal. \nWe will be using a mechanical switch as our sensor and use a transistor as a NOT gate, so that when there is an open switch in our room a transistor will show a signal that an intruder has entered.\nResistor\nTransistor\nBuzzer\nVoltage source\n\nRoom sensor is normally in a closed position and it is connected to a DC voltage source. When a door is open it creates an open circuit.\n\n\nTransistor switches are used for high power devices such as\nThe areas of operation for Transistor switch are known as the Saturation Region and the Cut-Off Region.\nCut-off Region: here there is a large depletion layer\n\n\nSaturation Region: here the depletion layer is as\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  NOT Gate Transistor\n\n\nA NOT gate simply inverts its input.

The input is connected through resistor R2 to the transistor’s\nWhen voltage is present at the input, the transistor turns on, allowing current to flow through the collector-emitter circuit directly to ground. This ground path creates a shortcut that bypasses the output, which causes the output to go low.\nWe run our simulation with a voltmeter connected to the output, in place of the buzzer .\n\nIn the normal state, the switch will be closed.\n\nWhen intrusion happens, the switch will open and the alarm (buzzer) will go off.",

I noticed that my Rails app (Fugu) kept logging out all users after every deployment.\nFirst, I thought it's an issue with Devise, but it turns out that it's related to a variabled called secret_key_base that Rails uses to sign and encrypt cookies (among other things).\nFor production, there are multiple places to define secret_key_base. A glance at the Rails soure code shows that Rails looks for it in ENV[\"SECRET_KEY_BASE\"], credentials.secret_key_base, or secrets.secret_key_base.\nIn my case, I hadn't set up any credentials or secrets, nor was I providing an environment variable.\nDigital Ocean (and, as it looks, Heroku) automatically sets the SECRET_KEY_BASE environment variable for you, and it changes with every deployment. And this was the problem. After each deployment, my Rails app couldn't decrypt the existing session cookies anymore beause secret_key_base had a different value, and my users needed to log in again.\nTo solve the problem, just provide a SECRET_KEY_BASE environment variable in your production server. The simplest way to generate it is to run rake secret in your terminal (make sure you're in a Rails project folder).",

          "description": "One of the most powerful features when creating Angular components is the Async Pipe. The greatest thing about it is that it allows you to take advantage of asynchronous rendering in your templates, but without having to worry about subscribing and unsubscribing from Observables.\nimport { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';\nimport { of, Subject } from 'rxjs';\nimport { delay, startWith, takeUntil } from 'rxjs/operators';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'my-app',\n  template: `\n    <h1>Async example</h1> \n    <h2>Items</h2> \n    <ul>\n      <li *ngFor=\"let item of items | async\">{{item}}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>Other Items</h2> \n    <ul>\n      <li *ngFor=\"let other of otherItems\">{{other}}</li>\n    </ul>\n  `,\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ]\n})\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy  {\n\n  items = of([1, 2, 3])\n    .pipe(\n      delay(2000), \n      startWith(['...'])\n    );\n\n  // vs \n\n  otherItems: any[];\n  private destroy$ = new Subject();\n  ngOnInit() {\n    of([1, 2, 3])\n      .pipe(\n        delay(2000),\n        startWith(['...']),\n        takeUntil(this.destroy$)\n      )\n      .subscribe(other  => this.otherItems = other)\n  }\n  ngOnDestroy() {\n    this.destroy$.next();\n    this.destroy$.complete();\n  }\n}\n\n\nCheck it out on Stackblitz.\nAs you can see, in the first example, we are rendering a list (items) using the async pipe in the HTML template. There is no need for the additional handling after the component is destroyed, which you can see is not the case for the other list otherItems.   That is simply because the async pipe is going to take care of that for you.",

In such scenarios most of the time BehaviorSubject is used which acts as a single store to hold updated shared data.\nBehaviorSubject is both observer and type of observable.\nBehaviorSubject always need an initial/default value.\nEvery observer on subscribe gets current value.\nCurrent value is either latest value emitted by source observable using next() method or initial/default value.\nLet’s implement BehaviorSubject to understand a concept better!\nFor e.g In order tracking app, display total items in cart and total items in wish list on UI in header and dashboard section based on user action.\nNow we have three components -\n\nRun Live\nWhen user add items in the cart/wishList, total count needs to be updated in the header and dashboard component.\n1.First create a BehaviorSubject in order service which holds the initial state of order count ,so that it can be used by any component.\n\n\n\n\n3.When a user performs any action, call the next() method of source observable. When the next() method gets called it will update current count with new count and notifies updated count to all observers(3 Components) who subscribed to source observable.\n\nThis way BehaviorSubject makes components communication more effective.\nThanks for reading!

          "description": "If we use OnPush change detection strategy, immutability is helpful to ensure change detection works expectedly. \nOne of the way to enforce immutability is using Immutable.js. However, using Immutable.js is not really straightforward. It adds another layer instead of using JS object directly e.g\nconst apps = List([{ name: 'slack' }, { name: 'skype' }]);\napps.get(0); // { name: 'slack' }\n\nconst app = Map({ name: 'slack' });\nmap.get(\"name\"); // 'slack'\n\n// Using Record if we want to access property directly\nconst AppRecord = Record({\n    name: ''\n});\n\nclass App extends AppRecord {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n    }\n}\n\nconst newApp = new App({ name: 'slack' });\nnewApp.name; // 'slack'\n\nWe have to use get when using List and Map. Using Record could solve the issue, but if we have a very large object, using Record will be hard to maintain because we need to create each record per object and it's nested object.\nOther issue is about JS compatibility because it needs to use fromJS and toJS methods to convert from and to JS object. \nI'd say that I'm not a fan of that lib and it makes things more complicated. \nOther possible approach I'm thinking of: \nreadonly + ESLint immutable\n\n\nSince Angular using Typescript, let's use Readonly<T>, ReadonlyArray to enforce immutability. \nAlso add this no-mutation ESLint rule as extra protection https://github.com/jonaskello/eslint-plugin-functional/blob/master/docs/rules/immutable-data.md\nis there any better approach? \nThank you",

We're on day five, which means going over the answers from yesterday and have 2 new challenges.\nThis challenge aimed to be generics 101, first introducing the concept of making your function pass a type from the function to the argument:\n-  function getBowl(items: any) {\n+  function getBowl<T>(items: T) {\n      return { items }\n  }\n\nThe any acted as hint clue about where to look, and this example is almost the first code sample on the Generics chapter in the Handbook, so it felt like a good intro.\nThe second part involved understanding generic constraints, these are …",

          "description": "Introduction\n\n\nIn this blog, we are going to look at, How to set up Storybooks with React and my all-time favourite language(TypeScript). \nStorybook is a UI development tool that lets you preview your components in a very rich library design that will help you to change all props for the component and test out your component in different scenarios. \nMaybe you should only use storybook if you're creating a component library(Open Source or for organisation). As for me, I created a component library for my organisation which is supposed to be used across multiple react projects. There I implemented Storybook(in component library project) so that everyone can have a preview of all components provided by the internal-component-library and use it according to the (kind of) storybook generated docs based on props.\nMake sure you have installed or created a new react project with\nnpx create-react-app storybook-ts-blog\n\nNow storybook can handle the setup part, just run the below command.\nnpx sb init\n\nIt will install storybook and add the necessary files for you to work with storybook.\nRun storybook using below command\nnpm run storybook\n\nMaybe you should also host the component library even if it's an internal project as it will help anyone other than devs(designers, managers) to have a look at your mess🤪(just kidding, I mean your components), just add basic authentication(username+password) before showing the hosted website.\nTo generate HTML files to host, run the below command\nnpm run build-storybook -- -o ./path/to/build\n\nTo run the build locally, use this command\nnpx http-server ./path/to/build",

          "description": "I've been working on a little side project which I ultimate decide to make public so that somebody else can maybe benefit from it on their own projects. typed is similar to superstruct and zod in that it validates data at runtime and it's type-safe but what's different about it is that it comes in a tiny package (1kb) with an ESM build and it also outperforms them by a significant amount. If you're curious about it you can check it out on GitHub or NPM.\n / \n        typed\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA blazing fast, dependency free, 1kb runtime type-checking library written entirely in typescript, meant to be used with it.\nThere are dozens of validation libraries out there, so why create yet another one? Well, I tried almost every library out there and there is only one that I really like called superstruct (which is awesome) that provides almost everything that I want, but still, I wanted to create my own. The others are simply bloated or don't provide proper typescript support. So that's where typed comes in.\ntyped is all about function composition. Each function is \"standalone\" and provides a safe way to validate data, you don't need a special kind of function to execute a schema against some value. All functions return a special type which is either Success<T> or Failure. If success is true then value is available and fully typed and if not, errors is…\nView on GitHub",

          "description": "As we know multiple components share the common data and always need updated shared data. In such scenarios most of the time BehaviorSubject is used which acts as a single store to hold updated shared data.\nBehaviorSubject is both observer and type of observable.\nBehaviorSubject always need an initial/default value.\nEvery observer on subscribe gets current value.\nCurrent value is either latest value emitted by source observable using next() method or initial/default value.\nLet’s implement BehaviorSubject to understand a concept better!\nFor e.g In order tracking app, display total items in cart and total items in wish list on UI in header and dashboard section based on user action.\nNow we have three components -\n\nRun Live\nWhen user add items in the cart/wishList, total count needs to be updated in the header and dashboard component.\n1.First create a BehaviorSubject in order service which holds the initial state of order count ,so that it can be used by any component.\n\n\n\n\n3.When a user performs any action, call the next() method of source observable. When the next() method gets called it will update current count with new count and notifies updated count to all observers(3 Components) who subscribed to source observable.\n\nThis way BehaviorSubject makes components communication more effective.\nThanks for reading!

However, if you were to do the above with 100 fetch calls instead, you might accidentally take down your server in a self-inflicted Denial of Service attack. Even if you protect against this in the API with rate-limiting, you're still going to see a lot of errors for failed requests as you scale up.\nAPIs are the exception.  Most types of external calls have no concept of rate-limiting at all - filesystem operations, system calls, etc.\nFor example, in NodeJS you can spawn new shells to call out to other programs on the computer.
