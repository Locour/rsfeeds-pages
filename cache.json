          "description": "In the design world, dark mode is the new black. Also known as the light-on-dark-color scheme, night mode, or black mode, dark mode displays everything on a dark background with light text and icons. \nDark mode isn’t a new concept, but it’s gained a lot of popularity in recent years — so much so that most operating systems, browsers, smartphones, and apps now support dark mode.\nDark mode became famous in 2018 when Sylvian Boyer extended dark mode to smartphones with OLED screens. Developers, gamers, and hackers quickly adopted the dark theme, and they remain the most significant users. \nAccording to a 2020 survey, 70 percent of developers prefer dark mode IDE while coding or programming.\nStill, dark mode has gained popularity even with general device users. Now, most operating systems, bro…",

When running from Azure Devops, you can take advantage of a form of Managed Identity and avoid any connection strings in your test code\nIf you're writing Devops Pipelines, you can setup Service Connections in your project which give you access to Azure subscriptions.

Actually, some implementations of fork propagate the call to clone().\nBesides controlling which parts of the execution context get shared from the parent process, the clone call offers the possibility for us to create a separate memory block for the child's stack. The nix implementation of clone has the following signature:\npub fn clone(\n cb: CloneCb<'_>, \n stack: &mut [u8], \n flags: CloneFlags, \n signal: Option<c_int>\n) -> Result<Pid>\n\nThe signal argument, if specified, is sent back to the parent when the child process terminates…",

          "description": "For SSR and node.js usage of Angular, we may need to have a Promise complete before the page is loaded. This is especially true when we need to create meta tags for SEO. Yes, our app is slower, but we have to get it indexable.\nEvery wonder why your meta tags seem to work sometimes, but not other times? It is because ngOnInit is NOT an async function, even with async, neither is a constructor which must return this, and neither is an async pipe in your template. Sometimes the fetches return on time, other times they don't. So, I added this post:\nngOnInit does NOT wait for the promise to complete. You can make it an async function if you feel like using await like so:\nimport { take } from 'rxjs/operators';\n\nasync ngOnInit(): Promise<any> {\n  const data = await this.service.getData().pipe(tak…",

It is awesome, let's see how the guard implemented:\n@Injectable()\nexport class LogoutGuard implements CanActivate {\n  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {\n  }\n\n  canActivate(): UrlTree {\n    this.store.dispatch(logout());\n    return this.router.createUrlTree(['auth', 'login']);\n  }\n}\n\nThat's it!\nThe canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!\nAfter this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.\nThank you for reading 🙏🏽\nHope you liked ☕",

By doing this, our content is ready to be served when needed without any delay. There are many ways of doing this, I'll be touching upon some of the ways to do this in Angular and how we can create our own custom preloading strategy based on the user's network state.\nAngular provides us with route-based preloading out of the box. There are two strategies namely PreloadAllModules and NoPreloading.\nNoPreloading, as the name suggests does not preload any modules. This is the default behaviour.\nPreloadAllModules, on the other hand, preloads all modules.

He apparently had figured out some creative npx commands.\nI wanted something simpler for him.\nKnowing he had NodeJS installed, we set the path to the Angular CLI and made a custom shortcut to the NodeJS Command Prompt.\nWe followed the rabbit hole and found the Angular CLI in the following location ...\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules\\@angular\\cli\n\nThen, we opened the Environment Variables and added this to the Path. This ensures that we are able to reference the CLI in the command prompt later.\n\n\nThen, we located the NodeJS Command Prompt shortcut ...\nC:\\Program Files\\nodejs\n\nWe then copied the shortcut and placed it on the desktop to make things a bit easier.\nThe biggest change we made to the shortcut was to set the \"Start In\" folder to the root of his projects folder ... we got to these settings by Right-Clicking and selecting Properties.\n\nThis simple setup gave him much more flexibility without any hassles for Angular development using the CLI.",

          "description": "While TypeScript is a godsend for React developers, its syntax is fairly intimidating to newcomers. I think generics are a big part of that: they look weird, their purpose isn't obvious, and they can be quite hard to parse.\nThis article aims to help you understand and demystify TypeScript generics in general, and their application to React in particular. They aren't that complex: if you understand functions, then generics aren't that far off.\nTo understand generics, we'll first start by comparing a standard TypeScript type to a JavaScript object.\n// a JavaScript object\nconst user = {\n  name: 'John',\n  status: 'online',\n};\n\n// and its TypeScript type\ntype User = {\n  name: string;\n  status: string;\n};\n\nAs you can see, very close. The main difference is that in JavaScript you care about the v…",

          "description": "We all agreed about not manipulating data inside component or better to say presentation layer.\nSo I decided to put logout logic inside guard, this way I will be able to just call logout route and done!\nFor this I've configured my authentication module routes like this:\n{\n    path: 'login',\n    component: AuthComponent,\n    data: { registering: false }\n  },\n  {\n    path: 'register',\n    component: AuthComponent,\n    data: { registering: true }\n  },\n  {\n    path: 'logout',\n    component: AuthComponent,\n    data: { registering: false },\n    canActivate: [LogoutGuard]\n  }\n\nI love to keep things as simple and low as possible 😁\nFor log out I've added canActivate field and passed the LogoutGuard, the guards have the ability to return UrlTree. It is awesome, let's see how the guard implemented:\n@Injectable()\nexport class LogoutGuard implements CanActivate {\n  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {\n  }\n\n  canActivate(): UrlTree {\n    this.store.dispatch(logout());\n    return this.router.createUrlTree(['auth', 'login']);\n  }\n}\n\nThat's it!\nThe canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!\nAfter this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.\nThank you for reading 🙏🏽\nHope you liked ☕",
