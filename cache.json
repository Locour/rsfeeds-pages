When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

          "description": "📌 The Auth0 Identity Maturity Framework helps you understand what’s working about your current identity implementation and what needs to mature.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \nToday’s users are accustomed to living and working online, and they expect a secure, effortless experience every time they access your platform. Seamless authentication is no longer a nice-to-have; it’s a requirement for success. And since companies are building more custom applications, users need fast, secure access across multiple platforms and devices. Identity touches every aspect of your business, so managing identity is more complex and more critical than ever before.\nIn response, organizations are exploring the value of third-party identity-as-a-service (IDaaS) platforms like Auth0. These solutions offer a centralized source of truth for authentication, authorization, and customer insight.\nIdentity maturity is a way of thinking about the efficacy of your existing identity solution and its capacity to handle new business requirements and customer demands as you grow and scale. Achieving identity maturity involves understanding what a fully functional, centralized authentication solution looks like. Evaluating your current state, creating a plan to improve your identity infrastructure, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement are also key to reaching identity maturity.\nAs an IDaaS provider, Auth0 works with organizations of all sizes in a diverse array of industries to tackle identity challenges. In doing so, we’ve learned a huge amount about the identity models that work for particular business needs and goals.  \nIn fact, we’ve consolidated our expertise and our customers’ knowledge and experiences into a solution we call the Auth0 Identity Maturity Framework (IMF): a collection of tools, tactics, and expert input that will help you understand what’s working about your identity solution and what needs to change. \nRead more...",

You can read the announcement here.\nFor the purposes of this guide we will deploy the basic app scaffold provided by create-next-app\nSince we will be using Amplify, we first need to go through the installation and setup process. We can figure out how to do that by following the official docs.\nOnce we have Amplify configured we can go ahead and create a project. We can achieve that by running amplify init\n\nAmplify provides a zero config deploy similar to vercel, which allows us to connect a git provider to use for our deployments. To get started we can go the the Amplify console and select Host web app.\n\nWe can now select our preferred git provider such as Github for this example.\n\nAfter selecting our desired git provider we can select which branch we would like to deploy from.\n\nAfter selecting a branch we can now configure our build settings, for the most part we won't need to modify this config as Amplify will take care of that for us.\n\nNow we can review everything looks correct before triggering a deploy.\n\nFinally we can see the deployment starting and in a few minutes our site will be live!\n\nThanks to Amplify we can now deploy Next.js SSR app on AWS with a relatively low effort. Let me know what you think about this new feature!",

This is one of the most important and most complicated virtualization techniques that the operating system performs. Because of that we will discuss memory virtualization in three separate articles. The goals of the operating system with respect to memory are as follows:\nGive processes a contiguous address space\nGive processes memory isolation from each other\nDo both of the above efficiently with respect to memory usage and processing speed\nLet’s first talk about what memory is.

          "description": "Vim is the best text editor out there. I have been using it for almost a decade now and I’m not going back to Sublime Text or Atom or even Notepad. The fact that you can do all of your development work in the same tool that is also used to write your code is amazing.\nVim is a powerful text editor with a lot of history and a certain aura of mystique around it. In this article, I'll try to dispel some of the myths around Vim and explain why you should learn to use it on the command line.\nAnyone who spends significant time in front of a terminal should consider learning to use vim.\nFirst, why not learn to use Emacs or [insert favorite text editor here]? The two main reasons I like Vim are that it's ubiquitous and easy to use. Most server installations have Vim available. There's even a version included with Mac OS X.\nYou can use it while coding, writing articles, notes, or even making spreadsheets. It can literally be everywhere you are! You can edit files through ssh! \nUnlike the latest frontend framework or latest shiny language, vim always stays the same through the years. So it's good to learn vim.\nVim has been the main editor used by most Linux users for at least 15 years, so you'll almost certainly find it on any server where you need to log in via SSH.\nLearn Vim by interactive exercises, no need to struggle with man pages or blogs.\nYou can use the keys to navigate your code and vim. Press gg to move to the top of the file, press G to move to the end of the file, press / to search etc.\nOnce you know the shortcuts, it's a lot easier than grabbing your mouse and going to the menu bar, click edit, click find etc. It saves you a lot of time when coding.\nAny reasonably recent version of Vim has strong support for all kinds of programming languages, so it's great for editing source code.\nVim supports all kinds of plugins and can be used even over an ssh connection to a sever. \nOn top of that, you can use plugins like YouCompleteMe for code completion and NerdTree for a file browser.",

Then, suddenly Redux - actions, reducers, middleware, dispatchers, and the list goes on. \nThe first time I saw Redux toolkit, the very first thing that hit me, in Reducers:\n...\nreducers: {\n    increment: state => {\n        state.value += 1;\n    }\n}\n...\n\nAssignment operator in a Reducer?

          "description": "In my last post we set up Inertia and Adonis. Now that we have a solid foundation to build upon, let us continue fleshing out our CRM app.\nIn my previous post we used a closure route to test everything worked end-to-end. This is fine for simple one-off routes (things like the \"about\" page for instance), but for more demanding routes, we'll usually reach for a controller.\nace to scaffold a resourceful controller:\nnode ace make:controller user -r\n\n\nTake a moment to look at the new controller, Ace created for you. This is a basic template for our future CRUD operations:\nimport { HttpContextContract } from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/HttpContext'\n\nexport default class UsersController {\n  public async index ({}: HttpContextContract) {\n  }\n\n  public async create ({}: HttpContextContract) {\n  }\n\n  public async store ({}: HttpContextContract) {\n  }\n\n  public async show ({}: HttpContextContract) {\n  }\n\n  public async edit ({}: HttpContextContract) {\n  }\n\n  public async update ({}: HttpContextContract) {\n  }\n\n  public async destroy ({}: HttpContextContract) {\n  }\n}\n\nNow, let's connect some routes to the users controller.\nOpen start/routes.ts and delete the route we previously created. Instead add this:\nRoute.resource('users', 'UsersController');\n\nThis doesn't look like much, but let's see what routes were automatically created for us:\nnode ace list:routes\n\n\nPretty neat! Adonis automatically created a route for each controller method.",

Even if these errors are unexpected errors that should cause our program to terminate, they will be caught before they can bubble up to our handle function.\nIn addition, the default error handler responds with an HTML page, which isn't ideal.

Once you get to know about the, you can start leveraging it to move your imperative logic into directives.\n\nWe are going to use a pattern that is used by  Angular Material. My intention with this post is to show you how these libraries do it. We just use what the library gives us, and most of the time we use it without actually knowing how it works.\nBy the end of the post, you would definitely think Was it always this easy to make cool stuff? \nThis is a very valid question that you can have. Why can't we just have a simple div and then style it accordingly in our component? Well, you can do that. \nDirectives can be easily added to HTM…",
