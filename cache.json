This is important as when you run the node using Typescript, you will be in a src/ directory, so when you build it, the file location is wrong because you are executing from the /dist directory. __dirname gives you the runtime location. \n\n\nfs.readFileSync() needs to be passed in a character encoding. Additionally fs also provides a readFile() function which is async.\n\n\nThe raw result from fs is not usable until you parse it with the JSON library.",

          "description": "Closures could sometimes be tricky to the point that you may find out things too late/costly.\nLook at this code fragment:\nlet a = [1, 2, 3];\nlet fn = [];\nfor (x of a) fn.push(() => x);\nfor (f of fn) console.log(f());\n\nSimply, we've added three functions to fn that each should return their corresponding value of list a. So, we expect to see this as output:\n0\n1\n2\n\nBut it's not what's going to happen. If you run the code you'll end up seeing this absurd thing:\n3\n3\n3\n\nNow, you can guess what has happened. The variable x is not even evaluated at the time of running the first loop. This is actually the correct behaviour, since we just declared a function that maybe called later, but certainly not now. The three functions are all ready to read the content of x whenever they've been called, and at that time x was ended up being 3.\nThis is quite common to have such setup in which you're using the loop's variable inside an anonymous function. To make sure you don't fall in, pass the value of the loop variable to your function. That is:\nlet a = [1, 2, 3];\nlet fn = [];\nfor (x of a)\n  fn.push(\n    (function (v) {\n      return () => v;\n    })(x)\n  );\nfor (f of fn) console.log(f());\n\nHere, I've used both syntaxes of anonymous function definitions to make things clean/separate. I'm sure you got the point, but in case you're interested to know more, have a look on these great posts:\nUnderstanding JavaScript Closures in For-loops\nPracticing Loops and Closures\nAbout Regular Encounters\nI've decided to record my daily encounters with professional issues on a somewhat regular basis.

It is not uncommon to have to wait 30 seconds or more before your application can begin serving traffic, which becomes a problem on platforms that scale down to zero waiting for incoming traffic and expect to quickly launch an application to process a request.\nQuarkus is a container native platform that addresses many of these performance issues, and in this blog post, we'll take a look at a simple Quarkus web application exposing a REST endpoint protected by Auth0.\nQuarkus has been designed to address the needs of serverless and container environments by reducing startup times and memory consumption. Perhaps the most exciting thing about Quarkus is its tight integration with GraalVM to allow applications to be compiled into native binaries.\nQuarkus integrates with a huge range of libraries, giving developers access to many familiar platforms and allowing for the migration of existing code bases. These libraries are selected or customized to run seamlessly on Quarkus and to be able to take advantage of native compilation.\nOf course, authentication is a central requirement of any modern web application, and Quarkus has out of the box support for OAuth, which in turn can be integrated into Auth0.\nRead more...",

For example, if the delimiter is a space, you get an array of words, and if the delimiter is an empty string, you get an array of each character in the string.\n\n\nHere are two examples that split one string by spaces, then another by digits using a regular expression:\n\n\n\n\nlet str = \"Hello World\";\nlet byWords = str.split(\" \");\n\nlet otherString = \"How9are7you2today\";\nlet byDigits = otherString.split(/\\d/);\n\n// byWords would have the value [\"Hello\", \"World\"]\n// byDigits would have the value [\"How\", \"are\", \"you\", \"today\"]\n\nNow let's use the split method inside the splitify function to split str into an array of words. The function should return the array.

          "description": "Running a bash script is easy, but it does take a few steps and it‚Äôs important to do them in the right order. In this post, we‚Äôll go through the steps to ensure that your script will run correctly üòâ\nThe first step is to make a bash script. Any bash script uses the Linux commands.  A script can simply be a file with a list of commands and the .sh extension. If you are new to Linux, you can use this site to practice. \nThe second step is to make sure that your script file is executable. In Linux and macOS, you can check if a file is executable by running the ls -l command and then looking for an x in the permissions column. \nThe example below shows the difference:\n$ ls -l *.sh\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 frank frank   43 mei 29 16:30 hello.sh\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 frank frank 8192 jul  1 19:41 not-executable.sh\n\nIf it isn‚Äôt executable, run the following command in Terminal.\nchmod +x script.sh\n\nTo start a script you write:\n./script.sh\n\nI can write a shell script when I need to, but then continue working in Python or Perl or C++ or whatever real programming language I'm most comfortable with at the time (these days mostly C++).\nFor example, one of my recent side projects involved crunching data from a database, working with various embedded systems and more. Shell is not the right tool for that kind of application.\nBash is more suited for when you write a lot of commands in the shell anyway and want to automate that.",

From the data center to the local science lab to the classroom to the server farm, there is probably a version of vim running.\nVim is a text editor that operates in the console. It is very popular among programmers, and is particularly well-suited to editing source code.\n\nVim is often used by terminal users. But it can also be used inside modern IDEs (vim mode) and there are graphical versions as well (gVim)\nIn this post, I'm going to lay out a Hacker's Guide to Vim. This will be a collection of the best \"Vim resources\" that I have come across. \nVim is a very complex tool with hundreds of commands and thousands of plugins that can be used to extend Vim and add functionality. So where do you start?\nYou can learn vim by exercise. This site offers interactive exercises. Vim is one of the programs you learn by doing.\nOf course, the official vim website is a good resource as well. It has some documentation and lets you download vim. If you use Linux vim or vi is probably already installed, the same for Mac OS X users.\nHow to setup vim for Python. I find it quite useful, as I write quite a lot of Python code. Of course you can write Python code in any editor you want, I find for small scripts it's very practical to fire up vim.\nAn introduction to vim. This article shows you the basics of vim. How to open a terminal, vim and how to quit (ESC ZQ).\nSettings up vim for javascript. If you write a lot of JS code, you can use vim. You can also use vim-mode inside visual studio code or phpstorm.\nA cheatsheet for vim. Shows an overview for the vim commands. While a cheat sheet is useful, i think it's better to practice a lot with the commands.\nA list of vim plugins. Personally I use NerdTree quite a bit.\nDo you know any others?
