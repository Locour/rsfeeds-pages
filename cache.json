          "description": "What is context switching? \n\n\nContext switching is a form of multitasking requiring developers to switch between unrelated tasks. \nFrequent context switching reduces productivity, decreases energy and creativity, and negatively impacts quality of work. Minimizing context switching can help developers better focus on their highest priority tasks, avoid mental fatigue, and reduce the risk of burnout. \nThe concept of context switching originated in computer science. When computers switch between tasks, they need to carry out several intermediary tasks to stop the previous task and begin the new task. Each switch costs time and energy:\n[Context switching] refers to the process of storing the system state for one task, so that task can be paused and another task resumed. A context switch can al…",

          "description": "Introduction\nA bit of background: I've been using Linux both on my desktops and servers since the early 2000s. I'll try to distill what I learned over those years into a simple and easy-to-follow guide, in a way that I would approach things if I had to start from scratch.\nI'll try to make things friendly towards new users - you should be able to follow the guide even if you have very little (or even no) experience with Linux. \nWe're going to start by going through the process of setting up a Linux VPS and then build upon that.\nSo, why even bother instead of going \"serverless\"?\nWell, first, there's no such thing as serverless, there are only servers controlled by you and servers controlled by someone else. In the long term, trading-off that control tends to come at a huge price.\nBy learning to run things yourself, even if you do end up going \"serverless\" on some projects, you'll have a much better and deeper understanding of those trade-offs, limitations, pitfalls, and lock-ins.\nEasy scaling promises, for the most part, are just that - promises. Even if they weren't, it's extremely unlikely that you'll really need them. A lot of people would be very surprised how much you can get from a single Linux box.\nConsidering what you get in return, running your own VPS is really cheap (you can get a nice KVM-based VPS for a few bucks a month). \nBut having full freedom and control over your server is priceless. With serverless options, you'll always be severely limited in what you can do and what you can depend upon (and even that limited set of dependencies is subject to change at any time).\nIn the next post, we're going to make a few important decisions about our new server.\nNote: This is part #1 of the Essential Guide to Linux Servers in-progress series.

          "description": "2020 Webpack & Babel is de facto\n\n\nThis year there has been a big movement in build tools in the JavaScript community.\n\nIn 2020, Webpack, especially in combination with Babel, seemed to be the de facto standard for build tools.\nHowever, in 2021, the popularity of a completely new development environment/build tool that does not include Webpack has skyrocketed.\nVite.\nESBuild that starts without build.\nNPM Trend, you can see that Vite has overtaken the number of downloads of create-react-app since July.\nThe Next.js team has also responded by abandoning Babel and introducing SWC, an ultra-fast TypeScript compiler, in Next v12.\nWhat does that mean for us React Developers?\nThe Vite default react-ts template lacked Jest and ESLint (Prettier integrated).\nJest comes pre-installed with React-Testing-Library, Hook-Testing-Library, MSW, and TypeScript support.\nYou can easily install and run Jest with the following commands, \nyarn\nnpx degit laststance/vite-react-ts-extended myapp\ncd myapp\nyarn install\nyarn dev\n\nnpm\nnpx degit laststance/vite-react-ts-extended myapp\ncd myapp\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n\ngithub: https://github.com/laststance/vite-react-ts-extended\nso I would be happy if you could use it as a way to build a instant React+TypeScript development environment for new libraries or anything else! 💅",

          "description": "Introduction\n\n\nWith the stable growth of web projects, developers have found that they need some tools that will make maintaining and writing new code easier. There are various ways to help you to verify and validate code such as tests, contracts, typing, etc. We are going to focus on  type systems in different static typing languages useful in web development centering on comparison by a couple of parameters.\nWe are not going to look for winners or losers because decisions taken on the type systems in languages we are going to discuss didn't come from scratch. If we were going to rate any of these languages objectively, we would need to take into account the whole ecosystem of language, history, advantages, and limitations that appeared in languages because of their design.\nHow easily/ele…",

          "description": "The most part of applications written in JS nowadays uses at least few calls of Promises API, some of them uses es5 syntax, others async/await. But sometimes incomplete understanding of this technology(as in any other) can lead to unpredictable behavior, which can confuse uses, and take hours for you to understand the cause of the problem.\nSpending too much time in writing JS code, i've found interesting case with promises: promises have an API which can lead to incorrect interpreting of potential result.\nThis is mostly related to classic es5 promise realization, but, alas, also affects async/await promises realization.\nLets as an example check the process of saving user:\nconst handleSave = userData => {\n  saveUser(rawUserData)\n    .then(user => showNotification(`User ${getUserName(user)} …",

But I hope this article can be a reference for you.\n# Introduction\nThe story began when I decided to switch from Angular to React as my favorite and go-to framework in June 2021. Previously, everything is fine. I googled normally when I have to do some troubleshooting or just want to search for information related to my project using React. Everything changed when I started to feel tired of googling the same thing each time I need that information or code snippet.\nA college friend suggested I make my docs site. Then, he also showed me his own docs site at base.sznm.dev. Like before, I asked him, \"Why did you make this? It's just like you put your notes her…",
