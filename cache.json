          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

Headless CMS helps content editors, marketers, and developers work together to deliver a better content experience to their users.\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  Does Sanity CMS work in China?\n\n\nThe short answer is No. \nWhy?

If you are just testing Sanity out, and don't need your site to be highly available in China. It doesn't hurt to try.\nSince the Sanity CMS is based on GCP (Google Cloud Platform), if GCP has good support in China, we probably can still use it in production, but what we found was this: \n\" Google does not offer and has not offered cloud platform services inside China and Google Cloud is not weighing options to offer the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in China.\"\nGoogle's Media Statement\nSo this looks like Sanity CMS doesn't work in China by \"words\" and it is also not in the coverage area of the Sanity and GCP. The next thing we want to know is: if a website is published with Sanity CMS, whether the site can be loaded in China or not. More specifically, how fast the site loads in China.

You can download a glossary Web API from this GitHub repository by running the following command in a terminal window:\ngit clone --branch starter --single-branch https://github.com/auth0-blog/glossary-web-api-aspnet.git\n\n\nThis ASP.NET application provides you with a CRUD Web API to manage a glossary of terms. You can learn the details of its implementation by reading this article.\nOnce you download the application, move to the glossary-web-api-aspnet folder and launch it by typing dotnet run in a terminal window. By pointing your browser to https://localhost:5001/swagger, you should see a page like the following to interactively test the APIs:\n\nThe Web API application allows you to get a list of term definitions or a single term definition. It also lets you create a new definition and modify or delete an existing one.\nThe current implementation of this glossary Web API allows anyone to perform all the available operations on the glossary. Most probably, you want to allow everyone to get a single glossary item or the full glossary. Still, only authorized users should be enabled to create, update, and delete glossary items.\nLet's go and see how to protect these three actions by integrating your ASP.NET Core Web API with Auth0 services.\nRead more...",

As a philosophy, it complements endpoint security, which focuses on individual devices; network security instead focuses on how those devices interact, and on the connective tissue between them. \nAccording to the SANS institute Network security is the process of taking physical and software preventative measures to protect the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, malfunction, modification, destruction, or improper disclosure, thereby creating a secure platform for computers, users, and programs to perform their permitted critical functions within a secure environment. \nA brief network security consists of Three layers, Protection, Detection, and Reaction. This is a kind of defense-in-depth strategy. But a system should not rely on a single line of the defense system, rather it should have multiple defense strategies lined up. \nSo how can you test your network and security skills, there is a perfect website to validate your skills and prove yourself as a network and security expert.

However, some of these areas will consist of extra information. Expect to see changes in the following regions:\n• Threats, assaults, and vulnerabilities\n• Cloud assist\nAlso, expect to peer extra overall performance-based questions (PBQs) on SY0-601.\nProfessionals need to determine to take every examination based on their man or woman's needs and timeline. Both assessments will train you on how to recognize and manipulate security threats, but if you’re equipped properly now SY0-501 is the most effective examination to be had until October.\nIf you can wait till October, the SY0-601 will include updates based totally on the nature of the current cyber protection environment and troubles that cyber protection specialists are combating these days. If you decide to put together for SY0-601 make certain that your examination education is appropriate to that exam!",

Or a third-party scanning tool found the repository to be out of compliance.\nIn such cases, you may want to temporarily disable the repository while you work to resolve the issue.\nLet's see now how to disable a repo. It is very easy.\nJust go to the Project Settings, scroll down to the Repositories section and enter it, then click on the specific repo you want to Disable. In the settings, you have the Disable Repo switch\n\nWhen a repo is disabled, it still shows up in the list of repos, however no one can access or update its content.\nAnd you would also see a message saying that the repo has been disabled when they try to access it in the Azure Repos UI.\n\nAnd of course after the necessary mitigation steps have been taken, disabled repositories can be re-enabled using the same setting.\nFinal note: you can disable a repository only if you are either admin or owner, or you have the Delete repository permissions.\nLet me know in the comment section below if you think this is useful and if you've ever been in a situation in which you could have disabled a repo.\nLike, share and follow me 🚀 for more content:\n📽 YouTube\nBuy me a coffee\nPatreon\nCoderDave.io Website\nMerch\nFacebook page\nGitHub\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nPodcast",

Not necessarily tech, you can just read on and understand what I am rambling on about.\nI finally created my own Docker image of a gin-app and deployed it in a kubernetes pod.\nThe biggest challenge? Connecting the 2 pods, our otlp-example and the opentelemetry-collector. \nI needed to connect from pod A to port 4317 of pod B. Ofcourse, i had exposed the port in pod B using NodePort yet it didn't seem to work.\nWhat finally worked? Instead of using 0.0.0.0:4317, I just needed to use otel-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4317 psst, it's the port name (or deployment name? not sure) , then namespace, then service and so on, which is exposed by a Node Port in this other service.\nMAN ELASTIC APM IS AMAZING. LIKE. SO AMAZING TO LOOK AT THE TRACING <3\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Stuff I need to check out tomorrow? 📅\n\n\n\nPlan on figuring out how to collect logs from a pod using fluentD and exporting it to our dear openetelemetry-collector. \nUse env vars to toggle the GRPC connection port.\nNothing today\nThanks for listening to the rant.\nUddeshya Singh,\nSigning off.",

          "description": "I believe that the reactive form library in Angular is one of the most powerful tools in the framework. Developers can create performant and reactive forms that provide great UI/UX. One part of the reactive form toolkit that I think people often overlook is creating custom validators. In this article I show how to create a custom password field validator and how to use it.\nReactive forms create objects that all inherit from the same AbstractControl. The AbstractControl has an errors object property, which is where I can get or set validation errors for the form or particular control. This errors object contains key value pairs. When using the default built-in validation, these key value pairs are predefined with specific (often boolean) values. That means that I would need to evaluate the …",

A diff between virtual nodes, accessing the DOM only for modification, is the premise of virtual DOM. It avoids the DOM as much as possible, favoring plain JavaScript objects instead, making reading and writing much cheaper.\nThe Million virtual DOM contains three main functions: m, createElement, patch.
