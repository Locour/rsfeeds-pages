I listed all the necessary tasks to be done and sent the issue. After she accepted and assigned me to the issue, I started to write code right away and created a pull request for the code I wrote. It's actually not a big deal for me at all because her code was pretty clean and understandable. Although she requested a few changes in my code, everything went well and my pull request got merged right after that.\nSame thing happens in my code I guess because we had no trouble understanding each other's code. The process was quite straight forward, she filed an issue -> I accepted it -> she coded it -> I requested some changes as she added some extra lines that were not necessary. However, there was one thing I had to do which is pulling her code into my machine so that I could test it out. While testing her code, I just realized that I had a quite big bug in my code that I didn't know about. However, her issue was just for the new feature about config file, so I decided to create another issue about the bug I mentioned above and resolved it after her code got merged.\nMy issue link\nMy pull request\nHer repo\nHer issue link\nHer pull request\nMy repo\nThank you for reading!",

While it may be a significant factor, there are a lot of other things that play a major role in enabling companies to decide whether outsourcing for custom software development is a good idea or not. Since there is a high demand for digital software solutions and products, the outsourcing market is not just based on cost anymore.\nFrom building products from scratch to re-engineering and maintenance of existing produc…",

GitHub Apps can do that for you. \nGitHub Apps are applications that give you access to GitHub APIs, so that you can build integrations with GitHub, with the benefits of productivity, flexibility and reduced friction in your workflow. They can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts, and granted access to specific repositories. They come with granular permissions and built-in webhooks.\nTo improve your workflow, you can create a GitHub App that contains multiple scripts or an entire application, and then connect that app to many other tools. For example, you can connect GitHub Apps to GitHub or Slack. For the Knative project, we have a GitHub App …",

It is awesome, let's see how the guard implemented:\n@Injectable()\nexport class LogoutGuard implements CanActivate {\n  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {\n  }\n\n  canActivate(): UrlTree {\n    this.store.dispatch(logout());\n    return this.router.createUrlTree(['auth', 'login']);\n  }\n}\n\nThat's it!\nThe canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!\nAfter this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.\nThank you for reading 🙏🏽\nHope you liked ☕",

If you find this post interesting, check out my website for more content like this.\nReact Context is one of the core React APIs that can be used anytime you are developing with React. Context allows us to create a piece of state that is globally shared among many different components.\nAt its core, Context helps to solve one main issue: \"prop drilling.\" Prop drilling is the name for when a property\nFor example, suppose that we store information about a user's application preferences (language, timezone, privacy, etc.) and need to use that to render the application correctly. To render the application, we must write something like:\n<App preferences={preferences} />\n// Inside App:\n<Profile preferences={preferences} />\n// Inside Pro…",

Today I'm playing with Google Sheets API and got an idea I could play a video in a sheet using cells like pixels.\nTL;DR This is the final result!😉 (The following video frame refresh is x10 faster than actual. I edited by a video editor.)\n\nI prepared 160 x 90 cells in a Google Sheet and changed cell colors by using Google Sheets API. The API has a API to change cell colors by one API call in bulk. I called the API for each video frame and played a video.\nFirst, I converted the famous video \"Big Bunny\" to JPG images by using ffmpeg. I used 1 image per second and generated 300 images. According to my experiments, Google Sheets API needs ~3 sec to refresh cell colors by a API call so I selected much less images than video frames. And I resized the image frame …",
