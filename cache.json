I used to solve this issue by creating a main node_modules folder in my hard disk and use symlinks to all my folders, but it's kind of frustrating so I drop this solution not very long after.\nrecently I have read about a new tool that solves the three issues that we discussed above that tool is called pnpm. pnpm is tools that is very similar to npm, if familiar with how npm commands pnpm is just the same. when using npm or yarn if have 1000 project that means you will have 1000 dependencies folder in each project in your hard drive, pnpm will install all the dependencies in one universal folder that is linked to all of your 1000 project using sumlinks that is managed for you under the hood.\nthis approach solve all the issues that we discussed earlier if you have already installed a dependency it will use that one instead of downloading in from the start. this means less storage used and faster installing process how cool is that, it even have a very minimalist log message. \nthe first day I used pnpm I felt over the top because it solves an issue I hated so mush and after couple of days using it I've had no issues using it so I felt that I need to share this tool with everyone that didn't hear about.\nconclusion:\nif you know any other tools that I didn't hear about I'd love you to share your knowledge with me.",

          "description": "Privacy and transparency are some of the most important requirements that most modern social networks like Facebook and Instagram do not meet. \nOne of the best examples of privacy nightmare is TikTok is. It collects some very troubling data points such as the number of CPUs your device has, available disk space, your IP & MAC addresses, whether your phone is jailbroken, and so much more, which does not have anything to do with TikTok. Imagine that there are so many more applications and websites that do essentially the same thing and sell your information to 3rd party advertisers. Internet is slowly becoming a place where one company can easily predict what type of person you are, based on all data points that they collected over time.\nTo end this, I have open-sourced the social network that I was working on for more than a year! It is called Polygon and the main goal for it is to be a social network that is not hungry for your data. Both the core and front-end are written in TypeScript and are seeking support from the open-source community. We also have a hosting guide that is written in Python.There is also some tooling written in Go. My main goal is to make it a private, easy-to-use, and crisp social network which will be adapted by privacy and open-source enthusiasts all over the world. \nPolygon is also open for Hacktoberfest contributions, which means that both beginners and professionals can contribute to the project and learn something new!\nYou can find all projects related to Polygon at: https://github.com/polygon-isecure\nThank you!",

Convox is showing its age and this year we began the process of replacing Convox with HashiCorp’s Nomad, a flexible workload orchestrator to deploy and manage our containers on AWS.\nAs we prepared our migration to Nomad, our biggest concern was performance. We started our tests with a barebones proof-of-concept setup of our API in Nomad. We benchmarked and compared the two systems and found Nomad was running slower.

On the one hand, allowing users to prematurely access your product means that you might wind up serving a lot of users who you never truly monetize. On the other hand, putting a login wall between potential users and content could lead to slower growth and a smaller user base.\nAccording to Blue Research, 54% of users will abandon a website if the registration process is too cumbersome.

No less than 8 packages in one, all just for the api client code?! Coming from a place where we just simply used an instance of Axios with the bare minimum configuration and direct calls to the backend REST api, this sounds like madness to me. \n[Image hinting the structure of Nemo? ]\nBut the task is simple and mechanical! All the important code infrastructure for Nemo is already there, so my work comes down to moving types and definitions from Manager to the different Nemo packages, adding testing and m…",

          "description": "It's time to talk about it... Not Next, nor Nuxt, but Nest!\nSome time ago, I challenged myself to build a robust backend solution in JavaScript. Many developers believe that JavaScript isn't secure enough, efficient or simply organized to manage data through APIs. I'll convince you otherwise....\nFor this new project, I chose technologies that are on the rise, in particular PostgreSQL but especially NestJS. So, I gave up my good old database that is MongoDB, in favor of a more traditional database.\nNB: I was a little bit rusty at first, but going back to relational database was a real good idea; if only to retrieve data from several tables in one call, unlike NoSQL which requires as many calls as there are documents to query... Finally, SQL is like riding a bike, it's unforgettable 😉\nNestJ…",

          "description": "Privacy and transparency are some of the most important requirements that most modern social networks like Facebook and Instagram do not meet. \nOne of the best examples of privacy nightmare is TikTok is. It collects some very troubling data points such as the number of CPUs your device has, available disk space, your IP & MAC addresses, whether your phone is jailbroken, and so much more, which does not have anything to do with TikTok. Imagine that there are so many more applications and websites that do essentially the same thing and sell your information to 3rd party advertisers. Internet is slowly becoming a place where one company can easily predict what type of person you are, based on all data points that they collected over time.\nTo end this, I have open-sourced the social network that I was working on for more than a year! It is called Polygon and the main goal for it is to be a social network that is not hungry for your data. Both the core and front-end are written in TypeScript and are seeking support from the open-source community. We also have a hosting guide that is written in Python.There is also some tooling written in Go. My main goal is to make it a private, easy-to-use, and crisp social network which will be adapted by privacy and open-source enthusiasts all over the world. \nPolygon is also open for Hacktoberfest contributions, which means that both beginners and professionals can contribute to the project and learn something new!\nYou can find all projects related to Polygon at: https://github.com/polygon-isecure\nThank you!",
