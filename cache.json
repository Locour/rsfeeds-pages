Today, I wanted to talk about the experience of refactoring my entire code written in Nodejs and rewriting history in Git.\nTo be honest, I didn't think that it would be that difficult until I broke the whole thing. I literally had to rewrite everything from scratch. I mean not everything but everything. So first off, I had to create a readPath class which mainly will get the path from main to check if it is a folder or other files: .txt, .md, or .json so that I can use different method for different file types. After that, I need a produceFile class, which is going to help me in creating html file and a produceFolder class, which just helps me create a folder in the root directory where the user is sitting at. \nBefore using classes\nhere\nAfter using classes\nhere\nAnd the code is well organized and easy to read even if for beginners who are used to object-oriented programming.\nThanks to the assignment, I got a chance to learn more about rebasing, amending as well as using classes in Javascript. \n3fcb0c88",

But security is typically being left behind, and there are a number of challenges facing agile security.\nIncreasing regulations like the New York CRR 500, and BaFin in Germany are enforcing timely verification and risk-based approaches. With a need for more frequent and automatable checks, how do we make sure we understand the impact as well as the vulnerability?\nWith more and more high profile breaches, clients today demand to know the risks from their software supply chain. This challenges security, development and DevOps teams to shift left, to have software security checks in their SDLC …",

With the promise of speed and quality, it seamlessly integrates the functions of development and operations teams to ensure that applications can be continuously pushed out to production. However, the emphasis on speed often comes at the cost of security. Critical vulnerabilities are addressed only late in development, with security patches often being tacked on right before deployment. This is where DevSecOps, also known as Secure DevOps, comes in.\nSimply put, DevSecOps is the future of DevOps. DevSecOps involves integrating application security testing earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This notion of shifting security to the left is commonly cal…",

Blazor is making it possible to run.NET in the browser without the need for add-ons or plugins, due to a technique called WebAssembly.\nThis blog will examine the current status of Blazor, its features, and its preparedness for production use, before comparing it to one of the most popular frameworks, Angular.\nHere is why you should choose Angular for your next web development project.\nWhat is Blazor?\nBlazor is a new Microsoft web framework that lets programmers build browser code …",
