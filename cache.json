          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

          "description": "Since the initial release of React in 2013, Facebook has rolled out a robust collection of tools to help developers with some of the minutiae of the web application development process, allowing them to focus on what matters most.\nDespite React’s many capabilities and widespread adoption among developers, I’ve discovered that many of us face the same question: How can we handle complicated states with React? \nThis post will look at what state is, how to arrange it, and alternative patterns to use as our applications become more complicated.\nReact may be thought of as a blueprint in its most basic form. Your application will appear in a specific way depending on the status. React prefers declarative over imperative programming, a fancy way of stating that you express what you want to happen rather than the processes to get there. As a result, appropriately managing the state becomes critical, as the state determines how your program will act.\nRead the full article A Contemporary Guide on React State Patterns in 2021",

If you have a nodejs based web application and plan to upgrade the version of nodejs, then of course it becomes important to test the application on the new version to ensure its sanity.\nIn this post we will explore how can use Docker to run our nodejs based application with two (or more) versions of nodejs.\nLets explore the directory structure to understand how the files have been organized.\nvishalr@ubuntu ~> tree multi-node-app\nmulti-node-app/\n├── app\n│   ├── index.js\n│   └── package.json\n├── docker-compose.yml\n├── node14.Dockerfile\n├── node16.Dockerfile\n└── proxy\n    └── nginx.conf\n\n2 directories, 6 files\nvishalr@ubuntu ~> \n\nThe main app resides inside the app folder. The files node14.Dockerfile and node16.Dockerfile contain instructions to build docker image, to run app with Node v14.x and v16.x. The file docker-compose.yml is a wrapper over the two docker files and adds Nginx as proxy over two docker containers. The file proxy/nginx.conf contains the barebones configuration to use nginx as proxy for our application.\nAdditionally we also need to make the following entry in the file /etc/hosts.\n127.0.0.1  node16.myapp.local  node14.myapp.local\n\nTo start all the containers execute the following command -\nvishalr@ubuntu ~> docker-compose up\n\nOnce all the containers (nginx, node16 and node14) are up, you can use the urls http://node16.myapp.local and http://node14.myapp.local in your local browser to test your application running with Node v16.x and Node v14.x respectively. \nYou can find this project at my Github repository",

There are many more, for the same or different reasons.\nUber, a cab dispatch service, also uses Node.js for their core system. \nNode.js was chosen because the Uber service is used all over the world and requires a huge network system to operate.\nPaypal is a payment service that uses email accounts and the Internet.\nBy switching from Java to Node.js as the server-side development language, the gap with the front-side development has been reduced.\nLinkedIn is the social network for professional connections. It is best suited for people looking to make serious career moves who want to get noticed by relevant companies. \nPreviously, Ruby on Rails was used, but in order to increase the speed of access, it was moved to Node.js.\nNetflix is the world’s biggest global provider of video streaming including movies and television series, available in over 190 countries. As of July 2020, Netflix reported over 192 million subscribers worldwide, with more than 72 million in the U.S itself.\nPreviously, Netflix was using Java on the back end and JavaScript on the front end, which required the developers to be proficient with languages.\nNow, The user interface (UI) of Netflix was built using Node.js.\nNext, his is an explanation of the Node.js package management tool \"npm\".\nnpm is automatically installed when Node.js is installed.\nThere are two ways to install packages with npm \"global installation\" and \"local installation\".\nnpm allows to create a file called \"package.json\".\nThese are useful command of npm.\nnpm install npm \nnpm i npm \n\nnpm install [package name] \nnpm i [package name] \n\nnpm uninstall [package name] \nnpm rm [package name] \n\nnpm update [package name] \nnpm up [package name] \n\nnpm list \nnpm ls \n\nnpm init\n\nToday, I explained about basic Node.js.\nI hope this article helps you understand node.js!\nHappy coding! :)",

XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.

Once it is generated and submitted to the client, it can’t be easily made invalid. This is a big problem if the JWT got leaked and it did not expire (or worse, it does NOT have an expiration date). That is why it is important to make sure that your JWT can be invalidated at the server-side and I will show you two methods to do this.\nThe easiest way, at least at first glance, is to have a way of blacklisting a JWT once it is compromised. You can store all compromised JWTs in the database and when an authorization request is received, you check that the JWT used is not part of this list.

But if you're creating a mobile app using Kotlin Multiplatform, the KMP solution might not be as clear. Today we'll go over how to store encrypted key-value data with KMP without having to reinvent the wheel.\nMultiplatform Settings is a solid multiplatform key-value store, created by Touchlab's own Russell Wolf, used extensively at Touchlab, as well as in Jetbrains' KMM Production Sample. There is a Settings interface that is implemented for Android, iOS, MacOS, and JVM platforms. At first glance, it doesn't look like Multiplatform Settings o…",

This way, the properties are added all at once:\n\n\n\n\nDog.prototype = {\n  numLegs: 4,\n  eat: function() {\n    console.log(\"nom nom nom\");\n  },\n  describe: function() {\n    console.log(\"My name is \" + this.name + \".\")\n  }\n};\n\nThere is one crucial side effect of manually setting the prototype to a new object. It erases the constructor property! This property can be used to check which constructor function created the instance, but since the property has been overwritten, it now gives false results:\nTo fix this, whenever a prototype is manually set to a new object, remember to define the constructor property:\n\n\n\n\nfunction Dog(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\nDog.prototype = {\n  constructor: Dog, // <----\n  numLegs: 4,\n  eat: function() {\n    console.log(\"nom nom nom\");\n  },\n  describe: function() {\n    console.log(\"My name is \" + this.name);\n  }\n};",

Here's how to add numLegs to the Dog prototype:\n\n\n\n\nDog.prototype.numLegs = 4;\n\nfunction Dog(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\nDog.prototype.numLegs = 4;\n\nlet beagle = new Dog(\"Snoopy\");\nlet husky = new Dog(\"Rex\";\n\n* Now all instances of `Dog` have the `numLegs` property.\n\nconsole.log(beagle.numLegs); // will display 4\nconsole.log(husky.numLegs); // will display 4\n\nSince all instances automatically have the properties on the prototype, think of a prototype as a \"recipe\" for creating objects.

The AngularJS framework has been built and managed by Google.\nThe framework was developed to build the client-side applications. Since then, the framework has evolved to become a well defined and sought after JavaScript framework.\nAn…",

          "description": "JavaScript functions that return React elements are known as React components. These are the parameters that govern what will be added to the DOM. In addition, react components, like functions, may receive props as arguments, resulting in dynamically returned items.\nProps can be of any data type, although component data types may differ. Component A, for example, may anticipate a name argument with a text data type, but component B may anticipate an age argument with a numeric data type. Likewise, D may anticipate an onClick argument with a Function data type, but C may expect a post parameter with an object data type with characteristics like title and date.\nHow can we tell our component what kind of data it should expect?\nThis may be done in various methods, but this post will focus on PropTypes and TypeScript. Despite holding identical goals, these two techniques operate in different ways. So we’ll go through what these tools are, how to use them, and tell them apart before trying more advanced techniques.\nPrior knowledge of PropTypes and TypeScript is necessary for a thorough understanding of this article. You’ll also require an integrated development environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code.\nPropTypes is a type-checking tool for props in React apps that can be used at runtime. The PropTypes efficiency has been provided through the prop-types package since React 15.5. PropTypes let you specify the props that are expected in a component, such as whether they are mandatory or optional. You’ll get a warning in the browser’s JavaScript console if you provide a different type to an element or miss a required prop:\nRead the full article Best Practices for Checking PropTypes in React Components using TypeScript:",
