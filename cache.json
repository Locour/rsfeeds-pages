From time to time, emails purporting to be from Facebook or your bank drift into your inbox and insist you “verify your account.” Look closer and you spot the telltale signs of a scam: a sketchy-looking sender address, sloppy writing, and a complete lack of personalization. You sigh and hit delete.\nIt’s easy to be cynical about opportunistic, mass-mailed phishing attempts.

Gartner defines the Access Management market as: \"The access management (AM) market is defined by customers’ needs to establish, enforce, and manage run-time access controls for internal and external types of identities, as well as machine identities, interacting with cloud, modern standards-based web and legacy web applications\" Auth0 focuses on SaaS-delivered developer-centric and Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) use cases.\nFor more information, please download the full 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management report.\n\nThe Magic Quadrant recognized Okta (Auth0) as a Leader based on our Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision.  \nAuth0 believes that CIAM should do more to balance the three forces of security, privacy and convenience — not just keeping the bad actors out, but also driving customer loyalty and conversion and revenue to create a great experience for our customers, partners, and their end-users.\nWe believe vendors' experience in the space is a key consideration for Gartner in their Magic Quadrant Evaluations. As stated by one of our customers in their review of Auth0, included in the 2021 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer Access Management Report, Auth0 comes with great features out-of-the-box. We went live easily with Auth0 as our Identity Provider.

          "description": "In this simple tutorial, I will be explaining how to configure your windows subsystem for Linux efficiently and optimize your WSL performance when you're running applications through them.\n Everyone has widespread access to windows but they may or maynot be savvy enough to run their favorite flavour of linux due to various constraints\nWSL2 really makes life easy for those devs who can't access linux through a cloud provider or locally run it on their devices.\nWSL has support for various distros like Debian, Arch and Ubuntu.\nNow coming to the interesting part, windows has all access to the CPU and memory resources in your device and it is built in a way which will optimize the resource utilization but how do you limit your linux subsystem, let  us say you'd like to manipulate the configuration to suit your needs the best, then you should follow these steps.\nShut your current running instance of WSL using this command\nwsl --shutdown\n\nRun this command through powershell as administrator\nCreate a configuration file for WSL on your user profile directory\nnotepad \"$env:USERPROFILE\\.wslconfig\"\n\n This is the most important step in this project, so please follow carefully \nThe following parameters define their corresponding resources:\nCPU  = > cores dedicated to WSL\nMemory  = > RAM allocated to WSL\nAutoMount  = > Mount your default NTFS drive to your subsystem\nBoot => defines your booting options for services\nKernel  = > Custom kernel for linux\nLocalhostForwarding  = > for port-forwarding your applications running on localhost\nMy configuration for CPU and memory:\n[wsl2]\nmemory=9GB  \nprocessors=4\n\nThis is how you can configure your resources for WSL 😀. Feel free to leave some comments down below⬇️.\nYou can read this document for the reference",

It’s a complicated framework sometimes and there are lots of things that devs “just have to remember” or there will be bugs in your application that you won’t see until runtime.\nI wanted to remove this cognative load from NestJS engineers so that they can focus on valuable work instead. I wrote an ESLint plugin to alert developers directly in their IDE or editor when these common issues exist - (Available on NPM) https://www.npmjs.com/package/@darraghor/eslint-plugin-nestjs-typed\nHere is what I learned about writing ESLint plugins in typescript for typescript while building the plugin.\nESlint is the default linting tool in the JavaScript ( E CMA S cript) ecosystem.

The problem is that it is unlikely that every user will be comfortable with your app when it isn’t in a language that they use on a daily basis. This is where internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10) comes in.\nThe act of localizing an app is a common problem because of the dynamic nature, which stops tools like Google Translate from working. Therefore a large wealth of internationalization tools exists solves the problem in various ways, but in this tutorial I am going to showcase inlang which is a way to ensure type safety in your translations so you never miss a translation again.\nIf you would rather just give it a try without committing to a full project, give our in…",

          "description": "In this article we are going to talk about the differences between Javascript and Typescript, they are two languages that are widely use nowadays in all types of projects, JS was the first to be introduced as client-side language. As time passed the projects were JS was being used started to be too complex and heavy, thats were TS enters the game, and starts as language to resolve all the problems that JS was having at the moment, nowadays TS is a language widely used also and is becoming bigger and bigger, so I hope that with this article I can help you a little bit to now any differences or to resolve any doubts.\n\nThere are many differences, now I'm going to show you a comprehensible list of differences.\nJS is used for client-side mostly while TS is used mostly for both client-side and server-side.\nTS has an improved readability, since JS requires a lot of manual detection of bugs and errors, this has been improved a lot by TS.\nTS has static typing while JS doesn't support it since JS is a dynamically-typed language.\nTS supports ES6.\nTS has a full support in modern IDE.\nTS can also convert its code to JS if necessary.\nUsing TS means that you can use OOP(Object-oriented programming) principles.\nIn JS functions are considered an object and they can have its own method and properties.\nThe choice is up to you at the end on what to choose if you want to work with this languages, you will have to balance the pros and the cons between both of them, and make an educated choice. Usually the option you choose will come from different variables like having in mind the size and complexity of the project you are going to work on, there are more differences between this two languages but the ones I wrote are the main ones and the important ones, I hope you like the article, any queries feel free to comment and ask!",

Javascript works well for prototyping but becomes frustrating when you return to a project again. Suddenly, you see blocks of code where you can't understand what kind of data passes there.\nIn this article, I want to introduce you to Typescript while playing with code. Thus, you see it in action and don't overflow with an unnecessary theory. I recommend playing with the code you'll meet here in Typescript Playground.\nImagine you want to count items, which have the field meta that contains the field countable set to true, in an array. If an item doesn't have meta.countable, we don't count it.\nfunction getAmount (arr: any[]…",
