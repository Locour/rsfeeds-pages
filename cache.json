          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

These things can easily mess up with the code making it difficult to read.\nGolang avoids these type of problems by handling errors/exceptions atomically.\nresult, err := methodCall()\nif err != nil {\n  // handle error\n}\n// do something with the result\n\nWe can use a similar pattern in JavaScript with the help of a try-catch block like this.\nconst getData = async () => {\n  try {\n    const result = await methodCall();\n    return [result, null];\n  } catch(error) {\n    return [null, error];\n  }\n}\n\nIf any error occurs, we are returning the error in the second position of the array and the result as null in the first position.\nIf there is no error, we are returning the result in the first position and error as null in the second position.\nNow we can call the getData method then handle the result and error like this.\nconst [result, error] = await getData();\nif (error !== null) {\n  // handle the error\n}\n// do something with the result\n\nThis pattern of error handling makes it very easy to read and understand the code.\nLet me know what do you think about this pattern.\nOriginally published on blog.bibekkakati.me\nThank you for reading 🙏\nIf you enjoyed this article or found it helpful, give it a thumbs-up 👍\nFeel free to connect 👋\nTwitter | Instagram | LinkedIn\nIf you like my work and want to support it, you can do it here.

Modern-day developers are utilizing a blend of advanced technologies to get swifter and enhanced outcomes through their projects.\nIncreasing the use of MEAN Stack is one of the primary examples of this scenario. MEAN JS is utilized to craft robust and scalable web applications. Let’s explore what exactly is Mean Stack and how it can assist your business.\nWhat is the MEAN stack?\nMean stack is the compilation and synergy of technologies applied to build web applications. MEAN is used by several Web App Development Companies, and it precisely stands for “MongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js.”\nHow does Mean stack architecture work?\n\nThe Mean Stack Architecture works in five stages.\nStage 1: Angular as a client-side language is the foremost one to work on the client request.\nStage 2: The client request then goes into NodeJS being the JavaScript server-side language.\nStage 3: ExpressJS is then into the process and makes a database request.\nStage 4: Then MongoDB retrieves the data and sends the response to ExpressJS.\nStage 5: NodeJS returns the data to the AngularJS to showcase the outcomes, and in return, the data is taken back from the ExpressJS.\n20 reasons to use MEAN stack for web & mobile app development project\n1) Free & open-source stack\nIf you want to read more about all reasons then visit Why Use MEAN Stack for Web & Mobile App Development Project?",

Let's say it's an app that is bootstrapped by create-react-app. By default, this app will be served on the root path of a host, like medium.com. If it's supposed to be served on a sub-path like /apps/my-app, you have to tell the build script what the exact path it is. The way it receives the path value is through the env variable, actually as PUBLIC_URL.\nNow, let talk about how to inject env variables into the project.\nFor example, you are goi…",

I was aware of DynamoDb streams but never tried them.\nDynamoDB Streams are basically triggers like that we have in Relational DBs but the only difference is that it generates stream of events when there is a data change and you can easily pipe that stream into Kinesis or a Lambda (In my case it was lambda).\n\nAWS made the things look difficult but the process was not complex at all. \nAll I had to do was the following -\nSetup a stream on the dynamodb table which was just a one click action.\nCreate a new lambda function and attach it to the dynamodb stream which was also fairly easy\nRest was basic stuff of listening the data then processing it and finally saving it to the new table\nDynamoDB streams are much more than what I have covered in my use case.

This is a kind of defense-in-depth strategy. But a system should not rely on a single line of the defense system, rather it should have multiple defense strategies lined up. \nSo how can you test your network and security skills, there is a perfect website to validate your skills and prove yourself as a network and security expert. You can visit Free Tech Exams website and attend CompTIA, A+, Network+, and Security+ Practice Test and Exam. They also provide certification on completion of your test. Each segment is consisting of 10 tests you can practice to. Good luck with becoming a network expert.",

I investigated the elastic APM exporter and realised that Sentry one is just not using it's full capabilities yet. You need to run span.Events() to get a list of events which can be further converted into *sentry.Event.\n\n\nAlso, in the prometheus-operator helm chart, we figured out how to add additional rules without having to \"upgrade the chart\" without putting in new values in values.yaml.

Or a third-party scanning tool found the repository to be out of compliance.\nIn such cases, you may want to temporarily disable the repository while you work to resolve the issue.\nLet's see now how to disable a repo. It is very easy.\nJust go to the Project Settings, scroll down to the Repositories section and enter it, then click on the specific repo you want to Disable. In the settings, you have the Disable Repo switch\n\nWhen a repo is disabled, it still shows up in the list of repos, however no one can access or update its content.\nAnd you would also see a message saying that the repo has been disabled when they try to access it in the Azure Repos UI.\n\nAnd of course after the necessary mitigation steps have been taken, disabled repositories can be re-enabled using the same setting.\nFinal note: you can disable a repository only if you are either admin or owner, or you have the Delete repository permissions.\nLet me know in the comment section below if you think this is useful and if you've ever been in a situation in which you could have disabled a repo.\nLike, share and follow me 🚀 for more content:\n📽 YouTube\nBuy me a coffee\nPatreon\nCoderDave.io Website\nMerch\nFacebook page\nGitHub\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nPodcast",

The latest version, 2.2.5 uses an outdated WebKit engine, which could cause some new web technologies to not work in the greeter. Also, the Debian package is not working, a shame.\nLuckily, Antergos team were developing a 3.0.0 version, getting rid of WebKit and using the QtWebEngine, based on Chromium, with Python.

Terminal or Command line are quite important to learn and are powerful as well.  \nVim is a text editor, not any text editor but a special and one of the fastest out there, if you use it wisely. Vim can be used in the terminal which means it can run terminal commands inside the editor interface.

Modern-day developers are utilizing a blend of advanced technologies to get swifter and enhanced outcomes through their projects.\nIncreasing the use of MEAN Stack is one of the primary examples of this scenario. MEAN JS is utilized to craft robust and scalable web applications. Let’s explore what exactly is Mean Stack and how it can assist your business.\nWhat is the MEAN stack?\nMean stack is the compilation and synergy of technologies applied to build web applications. MEAN is used by several Web App Development Companies, and it precisely stands for “MongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js.”\nHow does Mean stack architecture work?\n\nThe Mean Stack Architecture works in five stages.\nStage 1: Angular as a client-side language is the foremost one to work on the client request.\nStage 2: The client request then goes into NodeJS being the JavaScript server-side language.\nStage 3: ExpressJS is then into the process and makes a database request.\nStage 4: Then MongoDB retrieves the data and sends the response to ExpressJS.\nStage 5: NodeJS returns the data to the AngularJS to showcase the outcomes, and in return, the data is taken back from the ExpressJS.\n20 reasons to use MEAN stack for web & mobile app development project\n1) Free & open-source stack\nIf you want to read more about all reasons then visit Why Use MEAN Stack for Web & Mobile App Development Project?",

          "description": "When using Redux-connected components, there can be as many as three sources of props:\n  props passed from the parent component,\n  props returned from mapStateToProps,\n\n  props returned from mapDispatchToProps.\nWhen used with TypeScript, all those props need to have types. If it's a stateful class-based component, the state needs to be typed as well. This is a lot of manual type declaration, which has to be also maintained in the future. Luckily, starting from the version 7.1.2 of @types/react-redux package it's possible to automatically infer types of connected props in the most cases. The way to do that is documented in the React Redux documentation, and in this post we'll see the application on a concrete example. \nWe'll be refactoring a sample App component, the implementation (but not…",
