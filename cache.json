          "description": "Like many others I've been blown way by the incredible performance and capabilities of vite as a tool for rapidly building out React apps. In my role as an egghead educator and a Developer Advocate at PayPal I'm looking for tools that install quickly, have minimal setup costs and let me start building immediately. vite does all that and more, but in the past I often run into one limitation: I need some kind of API to complement my apps.\n\nI've been using express to build out APIs pretty much since it first came out. Checkout my course on using express 5 if you want a quick tutorial. Express makes it easy to build out APIs and it's super easy to add express support to your vite app. You just need a single plugin: vite-plugin-mix.\nI promised 5 seconds, so get ready to copy & paste!\nnpm install -D vite-plugin-mix\n\nThen in your vite.config.js file add this to your plugins array\nmix({\n  handler: './api.js',\n}),\n\nAnd then in api.js type:\nimport express from 'express';\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(\"/api/hello\", (req, res) => {\n  res.json({ hello: \"world\" });\n});\n\nexport const handler = app;\n\nOnce you do that you can startup vite with npm run dev and like magic you'll have the ability to reference /api/hello on your local dev server. Like everything else in vite, if you make any changes to your API they'll be available immediately without having to restart anything. Just edit the code and call the route again and you'll see the latest!\nOne little note: I have only used vite so far for local development and can't personally vouch for it for production apps. If you're looking for something a bit more production ready you might want to check out fastify-vite which combines another popular API server, fastify with vite for one powerful and fast full-stack development tool.\nHappy hacking friends!",

To install nodejs with apt package manager, just open up your terminal. Copy this command sudo apt update  && sudo apt upgrade and paste here, hit enter, and type your password.

          "description": "Data structure is the collection of data values, the relationship among them and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data according to Wikipedia.\nMemory in Data structure\nFor example:\n1 represented as a byte is 0000 0001         \n2 represented as a byte is 0000 0010\n3 represented as a byte is 0000 0011\n4 represented as a byte is 0000 0100\n\nThese are represented in base 2. And that gives us a finite amount of numbers we can store because base 2^8 = 256. So to save bigger numbers, we increase the bytes. \nIn java for example, \"int\" is the equivalent of 4 bytes, 32 bits integer. Type \"long\" represents 8 bytes, a 64 bits integer.\nEndianness in Data Structure\n65,000 decimal number in base 2 is: 0b11111101 11101000.\n0b here helps us know it is in base 2 and not 1,111,110,111,101,000\n\nThe answer above is in big-endian byte because the byte with the biggest 0b11111101 is written first reading from left to right. We can confirm this by converting the big-endian padded by another byte of zeros \"0b1111110100000000 to base 10\" on google. The result is 64,768 which is very close to our initial number of 65,000.\nFor networks, the standard is Big-endian and for most PCs, the standard is Little-endian. Check this code snippet online to find out what endian your machine runs. My machine runs on Little-endian.\nEndianness has largely ceased to be a matter of concern because of modern computer languages removing this needless complexity and processors which are Bi-endian and can handle both.",

Instead, please create your own IAM policies for DynamoDB.\nIn order to follow least privilege security conventions, it is best practice to create your own custom IAM policy for DynamoDB access by an application. If this is something you have never done before, don't be intimidated. I got ya. To get you started, here are a few templates I created to use to enable full access to only Amazon DynamoDB table resources. \nOnce you play with these templates, you should ultimately create a new policy that narrows access down to just the operations the app needs to do on the resources it needs to do it. If all you are doing is SELECT and INSERT with the PartiQL API for DynamoDB on one table, then the only actions you should allow are these two:\n\"dynamodb:PartiQLInsert\"\n\"dynamodb:PartiQLSelect\"\nIn summary, use security best practices when designing access to Amazon DynamoDB for your apps, create your own customer managed IAM policies and do not use the AWS managed IAM policies.",

In virtually any conceivable scenario, it is possible to hold such data on the server and reference it directly from server-side logic when needed. \nFor example, an application that receives users’ orders for various products should allow users to submit a product code and quantity and look up the price of each requested product in a server-side database.

With that, I’m learning about things like infrastructure as code through Terraform and the concept of infrastructure drift.\nSimply put, it’s when the state of your infrastructure is different from the state set by your IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code). For example, if you’ve deployed five lambdas via terraform with the default 128 MB of memory, but now three of them are using 256 MB then you h…",

You can feel comfortable following the same process in any ubuntu-baseds distro you use.\nInstallation of Nodejs is insanely easy with apt package manager in linux. To install nodejs with apt package manager, just open up your terminal. Copy this command sudo apt update  && sudo apt upgrade and paste here, hit enter, and type your password. Then we use the command sudo apt install nodejs, press enter, wait few seconds and you find your nodejs is successfully installed.

It pulls together all of your system information and strips out the crap and displays it in a way that doesnt hurt the brain....\nInstalling NeoFetch is as easy as typing the following two commands....\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:dawidd0811/neofetch\n\n\nand\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install neofetch\n\n\nthis add the official NeoFetch PPA to your ubuntu installation and means you will always get the most up to date version.\nafter that simply type neofetch in your terminal and you will get a screenshot like below.\n\nAnother app you can use is screenfetch which does near enough the exact same thing!.\nInstall it with the following command:\nsudo apt install screenfetch\n\n\nand then just type screenfetch in your terminal to get your system specs like below.\n\nWell thats going to do it today hope this quick blog post will be of interest and help you out. as a side note you can also get Screenfetch for MacOS.\n \nRaspada-Blog\n  I post on my blog primarily and share the posts via API, please check out Raspada-Blog for more posts and information.

Therefore, one does not has to work upfront with DOM or Data Object Model. Instead of that, it goes for a Virtual DOM layer. It updates only those parts of the actual DOM which is needed to update. This escalates the development speed in React instead of Angular. \nMoreover, the Virtual DOM is one of the best features to have as it resolves the issues associated with cross-browser.\nThe developers also get access to a unified API of cross-browser that runs even on old browser versions. Such excellent performance of React has made everyone not hire AngularJS developers and opt for ReactJS developers as it is becoming more and more popular than Angular.\n2. JSX…",

If params are present then show userDetails if not then list of users.\nLike So\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  { path: '/user', component: UsersComponent },\n  { path: '/user:userId', component : UserDetailsComponent}\n];\n\nHere we are explicitly stating that if url is /user then show UsersComponent or if it is like /users/xxxid then show userDetials page.\nThis is more Systematic & preferred way of doing the task.\nIf you are using only one parameter then use parameterized route.

One of the biggest changes coming to web development is  web3.0, if you are not living under a rock you have probably heard about it,  at least a little. With these changes coming to the web I decided to learn rust to make myself more valuable, this decision also comes after researching the kind of projects you could do. One of them is a compiler, which funny enough my favorite React framework Next uses. I am a big fan of Next and my goal is to understand how rust  made a framework that was already fast even faster.\nRead The Rust Programming Language \nTry and read at least 1-2 hours each week\nPractice solving co…",

But as it's a brand new version with breaking changes, I couldn't find an example project that I'm fully satisfied with.\nThe one on the official MUI's Github repo featuring Next.js with TypeScript (my framework of choice) didn't follow standard Next.js folder structure, as of this writing.\nSo I felt inclined to create one with the most basic features that I would use myself. The result is on my Github (link below).\nHere's a screenshot of the About page:\n\nIt features a standard folder structure as generated by create-next-app and the leanest usable ESLint + Prettier configs for linting/formatting.\nView on Github\nIf you like my work, please give it a star to let me know it's useful to you :)",

But before that, there is one question you need to ask yourself first, \"Why do I need to use Typescript in the first place 🤔?\"\nHonestly, Typescript might introduce a little bit more learning curve, and maybe a little bit more on syntax, with a trade of shorter and verbose syntax. Of course, there are more to just shorter and verbose.\nSo, the good of Typescript:\nMoving from type loosed to typed variables and functions.

Ok, look at the piece of code:\nlet a = 10;\n\nTypeScript infers a type quite smoothly — it's a number. This fact allows developers to not write such types everywhere. TypeScript takes care of it.
