          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

          "description": "Gulp is a cross-platform, streaming task runner that lets developers automate many development tasks. At a high level, gulp reads files as streams and pipes the streams to different tasks. The set tasks are code-based and use plugins.\nIf you’ve previously installed gulp globally, run npm rm --global gulp before following these instructions. For more information, read this\nTo verify that you have node.js installed, run\nnode --version\n\nIf it's not, follow the instructions here\nYou can choose to install gulp globally on your PC by running:\nnpm install --global gulp-cli\n\nThe above command will install gulp-cli globally and you will be able to run the gulp command anywhere, directly from your CLI/terminal.\nTo install gulp as a one-time dev-dependency in your project:\nLet's go ahead and create a new project. The mkdir command creates a new folder: my-project, and the cd command navigates to this directory.\nmkdir my-project\ncd my-project\n\nTo get started, we will need to generate a new package.json which will contain basic information about our project, to do this run:\nnpm init\n\nThis will guide you through giving your project a name, version, description, etc.\nnpm install --save-dev gulp\n\ngulp --version\n\nUsing your text editor, create a file named gulpfile.js in your project root with these contents.\nfunction defaultTask(cb){\n// place code for default task here\n cb();\n}\nexports.default= defaultTask\n\nFrom your project directory, run the following command:\ngulp\n\nThis command will automatically locate your gulpfile.js file and execcute it as a gulp task.\nYou can also run multiple task with gulp simultaneously by running:\ngulp <path/to/task1> <path/to/task2>\n\nIn this article, we've been able to cover the basics of gulp and how to install it both globally, and also as a one-time devDependency.\nKindly share if you found this helpful.",

Sure, there's a lot to say to stamp out “best practice” and I agree with most arguments in the article. Framing something as a best practice is subjective, and it could give the impression of being arrogant. But, as grown-ups, I'm convinced most of us know how to deal with the term and see why it's used. So pick the practices you agree on, which you see as 'best' practices yourself.\nI have the feeling that the importance of API Gateway in a setup is sometimes overlooked.

          "description": "📓 HIPAA and HITECH both provide legal guidelines for managing protected health information in the United States. Here is what businesses need to know to comply.\n\n\nIf your business processes protected health information (PHI) in the United States, you’ll need to familiarize yourself with both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act.\nBoth pieces of legislation provide legal guidelines for managing PHI in the United States and come with strict penalties for violations. For example, two health care networks were fined $5.5M each in two of the worst violations in recent history.\nHowever, each law manages and protects health data in different ways (and for different reasons). Below is a summary of what each law could mean for your business if it processes PHI in any format.\n\nHIPAA and HITECH are two separate laws with two different goals:\nHIPAA was passed in 1996 and was the first U.S. law to regulate how protected health information was managed. It introduced a set of security controls and privacy rights aimed at reducing fraud and waste in health care. HIPAA defined who was required to comply with its regulations (which HIPAA called “covered entities”) and how they were required to do so in order to protect health data.\nThe HITECH Act was passed in 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to encourage HIPAA-covered entities to adopt electronic health records (EHRs) for managing PHI. It offered financial incentives from 2011 to 2015 to transition to EHRs and to improve the delivery of healthcare. The HITECH Act also introduced new technical security standards (in addition to a few other things below) that complement and enhance HIPAA as well.\n\nRead more...",

Honestly, so far we made it so that we have incremental security measure in place. \nI think this is where I should say that, in security terms, there is nothing that is truly secure but we need to just slowdown the attack as much as we can to the point it doesn't make any sense for the attacker to continue. \npipenv install django-honeypot\npipenv lock -r > requirements.txt\n\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n    #...\n\n    # django-honeypot\n    'honeypot',\n    #...\n]\n\nif you want to activate the honeypot web app wide, the easiest way was to use a middleware provided by django-honeypot\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n    #...\n\n    # Django-honeypot\n    # https://pypi.org/project/django-honeypot/\n    'honeypot.middleware.HoneypotMiddleware',\n\n    #...\n]\n\nlastly add this variable to your settings.py file\n# Django-honeypot\n# https://pypi.org/project/django-honeypot/\nHONEYPOT_FIELD_NAME = \"secret_key\"\n\nAs of right now I feel that we made our web app a bit safer.

          "description": "In Linux systems, by default, the history does not include a timestamp, which can be annoying when you want to see when a command was executed to determine an update or some kind.\nSo today, I'll be showing you how to enable timestamps for the bash history in Linux.\nBefore we get started, let's look at how the history works and which files are attached.\nThe bash history is kept so we can retrieve whatever actions some user did.\nTo retrieve this history, we can type the following command.\nhistory\n\nIt should come back with something that looks like this.\n\nTo find where this file is located you can run the following command.\necho $HISTFILE\n\nIt will generally come back with a location like:\n/root/.bash_history\n\nHowever, to change the history output, we have to make a change in the configuration settings.\nThese configuration settings are set in a file called .bashrc.\nWe need to add the HISTTIMEFORMAT config settings, which will change the output.\nThere are two ways to include this in your .bashrc file.\nManually open the .bashrc file and paste it in.\nEcho it into the file.\n\n\n\n\n# method 1\nnano ~/.bashrc\n# now paste:\nexport HISTTIMEFORMAT=\"%F %T \"\n\n# method 2\necho 'export HISTTIMEFORMAT=\"%F %T \"' >> ~/.bashrc\n\nThe format we are using includes the %F and %T variables which stand for:\n%F: full date (year-month-day)\n%T: time (hour:minute:seconds)\nNow you won't see the change yet. We have to enable it, which we can do by rebooting or simply running this command:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nNow when we run the history command, we should see something like this.\n\nAs you can see, we now have timestamps in front of our history!\nThank you for reading my blog.

See it in action below:\n\nOne tricky part was how to show the whole content of the search query when its length passes a certain limit. That meant when hovering over it, dynamically change the content of the html anchor a element. On top of that the list is dynamically generated out of the last searches. I like challenges and I described in How to change the content of an html element on hover in Angular how I implemented this.\nAnother interesting aspect of the implementation was how to dynamically set the background color of the displayed search queries - this is described with the snippets and post at Set css class dynamically in Angular from expression\n👉 Codever is a bookmarks and snippets manager for developers & co.

While Typescript may enforce types in your code if you happen to pass a string to a type expecting a number things will still compile and may even work as expected still. With Rust this is not the case.
