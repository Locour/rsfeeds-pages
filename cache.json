If you use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can make use of the Linux environment for it. But what if you want to keep your dev environment on Windows 11? One of the most infamous errors you might be able to see is related to the node-gyp package. Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how to fix the node-gyp error on Windows 11.\nnode-gyp Package Dependencies\n\n\nThe node-gyp package is a part of npm, which is automatically installed while installing node.js. Therefore, you should be aware of your node.js and npm versions to get the issue sorted out.

Then, in app.js, I imported it:\nconst { caesarShift } = require('./utils')\n\nNow, since in my enciphering function I only allowed 26 possibilities (technically 52 counting the negative shifts, but those are also technically the same as the positive ones since I 'wrapped around'), I could generate them by calli…",

In the context of business, and specifically in IT, IP theft typically refers to a competitor or malicious actor getting access to trade secrets or proprietary algorithms to be used to the thief's own advantage.\nThe acceleration of digital transformation, which was exacerbated by the Covid pandemic, has stimulated the development of new technologies, consequently increasing the value of companies’ intellectual property.\nThis, of course, creates a huge opportunity for attackers and scammers.

          "description": "For as long as I can remember the recommended way to generate unique universal Identifiers in node.js was to the uuid module. These IDs are useful in all sorts of scenarios including for database keys, filenames, URLs, etc. Recently both node.js and the browser began offering nearly identical APIs that will generate 36-character version 4 uuids without any dependencies.\nAvailable in Chrome since July 2021 and coming soon other browsers is crypto.randomUUID(). There's a global crypto object that's available on the global self property. You can use that to generate a UUID like this:\nself.crypto.randomUUID();\n\nThe UUID it generates is a v4 UUID per the spec and ends up with a string that looks something like this:\n\"0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d\"\n\n\nYou want to do the same thing in node? Instead of reaching for the uuid package. As long as you're on version 14.17 or newer, you can do this:\nconst { randomUUID } = require(\"crypto\");\nrandomUUID(); // \"0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d\"\n\nIt's cool see node and the browser adopting powerful APIs for crypto and improved randomness. I'll definitely be reaching for these in the near future!\nYou can read more in the WebCrypto section in the MDN or the crypto section in the node.js docs.",

So they can scale in and out indipendently based on their specific workload.\nAutoscaling can be managed by a cloud provider (like GCP, SWA, etc.…",

It's highly competitive world of distributions, desktop environments, window managers, display managers, init systems, and ideologies to name a few. With this series of blog posts, I will be going to through all the basics of the Linux world and trying to explain, as best I can, what each concept or component is.\nOne of the first questions new users may ask themselves is what is a distribution. So let's explore that and answer that question.\nA Linux distribution is a collection of various software, modules, and configuration. Usually a distribution also has it's own purpose and philosophy. There are many distributions that use the Linux system as a core piece of their system. Even the kernel can vary in functionality from distribution to distributio…",

First, i could not set the keyboard layout to Spanish, so i googled how to do that, then i realized something was wrong, there where keys that do not correspond (Since i had a Spanish layout, not a Latin American, there are some tiny differences and no minor changes, but still, it annoyed me).\nSolution post-installation\n\n\n\nI used setxkbmap command with the -layout parameter, like this\nsetxkbmap -layout latam,es\n# If you want it permament just do\nsetxkbmap -layout latam,es >> $HOME/.profile\n\n\nAnd that's it, i hope you Latin American brothers and sisters have found your solution!

          "description": "Okay, so its not actually called \"specific Array combination types\", but that was the best description I had for it, before I looked it up.\nhttps://www.tutorialsteacher.com/typescript/typescript-tuple\nI'll come back to why this blew my mind today, but first, lets scroll back a bit, to some of my first steps into JS/TS programming. I started my programming career in Java, and one of the things that annoyed the hell out of me, was the fact that I could only have 1 object returned from a function (This was before the Pair class was introduced).\nBut in JS we can easily just return an array with 2 values:\nconst someFunction = () => {\n    return ['Mathias', 28];\n}\n\nAnd combined with some destructuring on the recieving, it was all nice and easy:\nconst [myName, myAge] = someFunction();\n\nUntil today I never had to add types onto a scenario like this, usually when I work with arrays, I either just do a basic string[], or when its required in complex object scenarios: Array<{name: string, age: number}>.\n[string, number]:\nconst someFunction = (): [string, number] => {\n    return ['Mathias', 28];\n}\n\nI came across this when I working with Vue2 combined with TS, and was trying to create a v-for loop over a Map, but Vue2 did not support this, so I had to come up with a different approach that supported the same end goal.\nSo this is where the new tuples came in handy! Given an example with some data in a Map:\nconst map = new Map<string, object>();\nmap.set('key1', {data: 'lots of data'});\nmap.set('key2', {data: 'more data'});\n\nI could then destructure it into an array like so:\nconst asArray = ...map.entries();\n// Yielding:\n[\n    ['key1', {data: 'lots of data'}],\n    ['key2', {data: 'more data'}],\n]\n\nAnd in order to Type this we now have:\nconst asArray: Array<[string, object]> = ...map.entries();\n\nThank you for reading this far, hope you gained something from this post.",
