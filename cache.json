This can be simplified with managed identities available in the Microsoft Azure cloud. Let's see how to deal with secrets management in ASP .NET Core applications hosted on the Azure cloud.\nManaging secrets in cloud solutions can be a big challenge. Whether it's a database password or a connection string to access a specific service ‚Äî these values should be stored securely. In the Microsoft Azure cloud, there is a dedicated service called Azure Key Vault. It is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets. When thinking about secrets, we should have in mind that they can be in many different forms. A database password is a secret, a certificate is a secret, and a cryptographic key is also considered a secret.\nStoring secrets in places like a configuration file can expose our application to vulnerabilities similar to the ones due to bad programming practices or bugs. Many developers struggle with managing secrets properly and looking for a solution to test the application locally without worrying about secrets management after deployment. This is where Azure Key Vault and Azure managed identities can help.\nIn this article, we will explore how to set up Azure Key Vault, store the secret in it, and access this secret from the ASP .NET Core application using Azure managed identity.

It had helped me understand more about software and  computers and also improved my workflow and speed up computing tasks in general and my love for the terminal keeps on reaching newer heights.\nI believe that Linux would be very interesting for those people who likes the DIY approach and since Windows 11 doesn't offer decent support for older hardware that can be one of the many reasons for you to change to a much more free and privacy respecting more secure and open operating system build by the people without business intentions (*not all though).\nDon't blindly switch to Linux when someone says so! It's not for everybody and I respect that. But for any of you interested in switching to full time Linux. Do watch this: linux-for-windows-users (The guy doing the video is not from a tech background!)\nDo check out my blog (some things have improved from the time of writing): reasons-i-switched-to-linux\nPS: Neither am I an activist nor trying to stir up any debate here Just the user!.

It‚Äôs not a program for everybody, but it suits my needs well.\nVim is one of the most powerful text editor that exists. It's a program that you can configure to make it do anything. It has a steep learning curve, and can take months or years to master. \nVim can be used without the mouse, everything using key presses. My first experience with vi was really bad (I forgot everything about it) but once I got used to it and learned a couple of commands and a few ex commands I fell in love with vi.\nYou could wonder, when writing code why use a mouse at all?\nOnce you know the vim commands it's very easy to use. It's a great bonus that it can be used in the terminal, because it lets you quickly edit your system files or edit files remotely using ssh.\nI was a fairly experienced computer user. I started using a computer around age 12 or so, taught myself basic programming when I was about 13, and eventually became rather adept at various aspects of the art of computing.\n\nI found myself needing to do a lot of system administration, and in the past I would have used nano, but I decided to try vim. I‚Äôd heard good things about it in the past but had never really tried it, so I was curious.\nHere are some reasons I switched to vi/vim : \n1) It is extremely fast \nVim is probably installed on your computer, if you open a terminal you can type\n$ vim\n\nAnd to exit press ZQ. If in the rare situation it's not installed, it is available in your package manager. However, even on a commercial OS like Mac OS X vim is available by default.\nIf you are new to vim, you can practice here",

          "description": "Custom Angular update schematics are executed in the alphabetical order by their names declared in migrations.json.\nWhen maintaining a custom Angular library and making breaking changes in major version, you'd like to provide your library users with a smooth migration path (nobody likes to spend much time fixing problems after upgrading npm dependencies, right?). For that purpose you can leverage scripts (aka. Angular custom schematics) that will apply code modifications to fix the breaking changes directly in user's codebase - when running a command, i.e. ng update @my/lib@2.0.0.\nAll the migration scripts of schematics are declared in a json file, i.e. migrations.json. And each of them is assigned to specific version (so you can have different schematics for migration from 1.x to 2.0, and different from 2.x to 3.0).\nBut you might have multiple schematics targeted for the same version, i.e. 2.0.0. In case  the order of schematics matter, you need to be aware that they are executed always in the alphabetical order by the name. That's why we should care about the prefix convention in migrations.json declared in our lib, for example numbering -01-, -02-, ...:\n{\n  \"schematics\": {\n    \"migration-v2--01-components\": {\n      \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n      \"factory\": \"./2/component-migration#migrate\",\n      \"description\": \"Migrate components\"\n    },\n    \"migration-v2--02-services\": {\n      \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n      \"factory\": \"./2/services-migration#migrate\",\n      \"description\": \"Migrate services\"\n    },\n  }\n}\n\nTo proof it's not the order of keys in the JSON that determines the order, but the alphabetical order of the keys (migration-v2--01-components, migration-v2--02-services), see the GitHub @angular/cli source code - sorting schematics by name.",

          "description": "@angular/cli: 12.0.0\nGitHub\nIn this article I would like to talk about an often-used feature on a user-centric application - the scroll-to-top button for allowing a user to quickly scroll to the top of the page, without having to use the mouse. The end result would be something like this:\n\nLet's break up this implementation into 3 steps:\n‚úîÔ∏è Set up the scroll-to-top button (with some nice styling).\nI have used @angular/material for some easy styling. In order to display the button fixed to the bottom-right corner of the page (and some nice hover effects with opacity), I have used the below properties on the :host -\n\nThis is an interesting section. To begin with, we need to set up an Observable on the scroll event of the DOCUMENT. You may directly access the document object, or you may use an InjectionToken<Document>, provided by angular.\nThis observable starts emitting values as soon as the user starts to scroll up or down. Now we are not really interested in the actual scroll event, but we would like to check something important every time the scroll event is fired - and that is the scroll position. Angular makes this quite simple with the ViewportScroller service from @angular/common package. This service has few useful methods, and I am going to use two of them - getScrollPosition and scrollToPosition.\n\nThe getScrollPosition method returns an array of 2 numbers - the X and Y coordinate. I check if the Y coordinate is more than 0 (which means the user has scrolled down) and I enable the scroll-to-top button.\nFor this last part, I make use of the scrollToPosition method, which again takes in the X and Y coordinates, and I scroll to [0, 0].\n\nCheers :-)",

          "description": "A simple POC where Angular requests the URL of an image to the Quarkus back end and then renders the image in the screen. Quarkus returns the image in two ways: (1) a simple copy from the URL of the image; (2) the image encoded in Base64 with the Media Type.\nThe project is available on GitHub poc-http-copy-images.\n\nLet's imagine a hypothetical situation where only the backend have access to the URL of some images and you want to render these images on the frontend.\nIn this POC, I propose two ways of solving this problem:\nThe backend access the URL of the image and expose the same Response object;\nThe backend access the URL of the image, encode it into Base64 and expose it into a JSON object with the Media Type.\nOptionally, you can run a Quarkus mock server which will provide three endpoints with the below images:\nhttp://localhost:8090/image/earth.png\nhttp://localhost:8090/image/moon.jpg\nhttp://localhost:8090/image/solarsystem.svg\n*** Optionally, because you can choose any image from the internet to run the test.\nEnter inside the mock-server folder and type:\n$ mvn quarkus:dev -Ddebug=5006\n\nThe swagger will be available at:\nhttp://localhost:8090/q/swagger-ui\n\nEnter inside the quarkus folder and type:\n$ mvn quarkus:dev -Ddebug=5006\n\nThe swagger will be available at:\nhttp://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui\n\nEnter inside the angular folder and type:\n$ npm install\n$ ng serve\n\nThe front end will be available at:\nhttp://localhost:4200/\nOk, in this screen, just put the URL of any image you desire (of the mock or the internet) and click on Load Image:\n\nAfter clicking in the button, the image will be displayed in two columns, the left one is the raw copy from the URL and the right one is the Base64 version:\n\nAny new image searched will be shown and the previous ones will slide down:",
