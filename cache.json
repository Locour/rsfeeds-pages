          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

          "description": "In this article we are going to learn how to configure multiple environments in a single React application. For example, you might want your dev environment connected to your dev API Endpoint, QA to QA endpoint and production to a production endpoint. We could solve this by using a single .env file but, each time you push your code to specific environments you need to remember to change the endpoint values, which is a slight headache and can be error prone. Let’s see how we can solve this!\n \nFirst, get the package env-cmd from npm by running\nnpm install — save-dev env-cmd\nNext, create your environment specific .env files. In this example, I’ve created a folder named “environments” in my root directory (same level as package.json). Important the environment variables MUST start with REACT_APP_ . Read more here.\nREACT_APP_API_END_POINT==http://my-dev-url.com\n\nPlease note .dev.env, .qa.env and .prod.env are three separate files in the environments folder. See below\n\nNext, update the package.json . Update the scripts portion of your package.json to include the following:\n“scripts”: {\n\n\nNext start your local/dev react application by running\nnpm run start:dev\nYou can test your env variable in your app by doing the following\nconsole.log(process.env.REACT_APP_API_END_POINT);\nFor QA and Production build replace the command npm run build to the newly added environment specific command npm run build:qa or npm run build:prod respectively. (For example, if you are on AWS, edit the buildspec on Codebuild and replace npm run build with npm run build:qa or npm run build:prod)\nI hope this article was helpful. Thanks and Cheers!",

This will make sure you have the same columns in the current database and the new one.\nMy columns look like this: \nGroup | Title | Username | Password | URL | Notes\nTo install and start the CSV database merge you can easily install from npmjs.com\n$ npm install merge-csv-keepass -g\nor\n$ yarn global add merge-csv-keepass\n\nIt is very easy to use, after installation you have access to a new command merge-csv-keepass where you just need to add few arguments and you are done!\nExample, we have a database db1.csv and db2.csv we want to merge them into a file merged_db.csv to do this we run the command:\nmerge-csv-keepass -source db1.csv db2.csv -output merged_db.csv\n\nDone! Simple, isn't it?\nKeep in mind that the script does not check if the output file exists! If it exists it will overwrite it!\nOf course you can add more databases than just two to merge, or even just one database to only remove duplikats from it.\nThe whole project is open source and available on Github.  \n / \n        merge-csv-keepass\n      \n    \nEnjoy your merging! :)",

The project was a combined effort from multiple teams and we're excited to see the wider community be able to leverage it.\nSo what is Confectionery anyways?  It is a rule library for the Conftest tool. By leveraging Conftest, teams can validate various configuration files via static scanning and policies written in the Rego language. The Confectionery ruleset as of the writing of this article is focused on Terraform. We plan to expand to other formats in the near future (Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests).

          "description": "I would like to present you a simple script which I wrote when I needed to merge the passwords database from LastPass to my current KeepassXC database.\n\nLet's start with my example, you want to migrate from LastPass but you already have existing passwords in Keepass.\nThat's why I wrote this script which will merge multiple databases exported in CSV and remove duplikats automatically.\nProHint: If you are esporting a database from LastPass (or other services), add the exported CSV first to the new Keepass database and set the columns you have on your other Keepass database and export as new CSV file. This will make sure you have the same columns in the current database and the new one.\nMy columns look like this: \nGroup | Title | Username | Password | URL | Notes\nTo install and start the CSV database merge you can easily install from npmjs.com\n$ npm install merge-csv-keepass -g\nor\n$ yarn global add merge-csv-keepass\n\nIt is very easy to use, after installation you have access to a new command merge-csv-keepass where you just need to add few arguments and you are done!\nExample, we have a database db1.csv and db2.csv we want to merge them into a file merged_db.csv to do this we run the command:\nmerge-csv-keepass -source db1.csv db2.csv -output merged_db.csv\n\nDone! Simple, isn't it?\nKeep in mind that the script does not check if the output file exists! If it exists it will overwrite it!\nOf course you can add more databases than just two to merge, or even just one database to only remove duplikats from it.\nThe whole project is open source and available on Github.  \n / \n        merge-csv-keepass\n      \n    \nEnjoy your merging! :)",

          "description": "Encryption is a two-way function. You can encrypt data, like a file, and then later decrypt it provided you have the proper encryption key. This is useful when you need to retrieve the original data.\nHashing, on the other hand, is a one-way function. It scrambles the input data into a unique output and you cannot reverse this process to reveal the original data.\nHow is a non-reversible operation useful? It's more secure for things like passwords. With encryption, the website server needs to have the encryption key to decrypt it. If the server gets hacked, the attackers could get this key and decrypt every user's password immediately.\nWith hashing, there is no key. Websites don't actually need to know a user's password, they just need to know that what the user enters in the password field matches what is stored in the database. They can do this by taking the password the user enters, hashing it in the same way they hashed it when the user first set it, and making sure both match. If they do, you get to log in.\nIf an attacker gets a list of hashed passwords, they'd have to generate a bunch of guesses, hash each one using the same algorithm, and compare the result to the hashed values one-by-one.",

Unlike nano, vim is a lot more powerful but is harder to learn.\nHow did I go from never using vim to using it all the time? How does one make a complete switch? I'll walk you through how I got here and share some tips along the way.\nIf you are trying to learn Vim, or you are on the fence about it, here are my top 5 reasons why I love this keyboard-centered editor:\nThe more I used it, the faster I became, and the faster I became the more productive I was.\n\n\nIt's everywhere. Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and every other operating system supports Vi/Vim. \n\n\nI don't like to use my mouse. I never did anything in Sublime Text without the help of my mouse. This is a annoying, easier to keep hands on the keyboard\n\n\nIt can be used over the network using ssh. Login to any box and use it.\n\n\nI use it for almost everything: programming, writing, blogging, etc.\n\n\n\n\nSwitching is up to you, but here are my reasons.\nWhy would somebody use ancient tools like vi/vim when there are so many modern ones out there? \nOne day I had to answer this question for my friend. He asked, “Why don’t you use Sublime Text like me?” I explain to him that sometimes it’s better to use older/simpler tools than more complex ones.\nHere are my reasons:\nLearn how to use the best editor ever made.\nNever get lost in a sea of menus and toolbars that you never use (just like vim does not have any).\nHave an excuse to use powerful, built-in commands that are available in no other editor (and are faster than anything you can do with a GUI).\nWork fast using commands\nTo practice vim, you can use this site",

A simple, but highly customizable, reactive state-management service is constructed on top of the RxJs BehaviorSubject. This approach can be used for both management of a global store or as model manager for a lazy-loaded route. Both use cases are illustrated through an Angular version 8 application.\nWhile the code in this application may be extended for practical use in your own applications, there is another motivation for studying the internals of state management.

Simply put, I couldn't find a form that satisfied my two main requirements:\n1) Responsive. The form should look good on a phone, a desktop, and everything in between. It's 2021 and most web traffic now goes  through mobile devices, so making your pages responsive should be a top priority.\nI was also looking for the following:\nHere's what I came up with:\n\n\n\n\nThe labels will disappear when there isn't enough horizontal space for them, but the form isn't smart enough to figure out the perfect breakpoint on its own: you'll have to manually specify that value in multi-step-nav.css. \nWhy add next and previous buttons in each step instead of reusing the same buttons everywhere? Doing it like this actually helps with the tabbing behavior: if you've tabbed to a next/previous button and press Enter, tabbing again will move you to the top of the new section, instead of tabbing out of the form towards the bottom of the document.\nThere's one accessibility feature I couldn't seem to figure out, however. When using NVDA (the most popular desktop screen reader according to the latest WebAIM survey) in browse mode, using the down arrow after pressing the Next or Previous button won't start reading at the top of the newly selected section.

          "description": "Hooks have landed the React world pretty hard. It isn't a full-on victory everywhere, I know places where people have more of a \"they're kids toys\" mentality and stay in 100% class + hookless function components, but in general I guess we can agree hooks have been a success.\nThere are a lot of posts on why hooks are great already, but I want to focus a bit more on nuances that might help you decide when to use classes, and when hooks are the better fit.\nYou can add context to class components, but the syntax can be a bit awkward especially if you're also using TypeScript and want to get the goodies:\nclass YourComponent extends React.PureComponent {\n  static contextType = YourContext;\n  context: React.ContextType<typeof YourContext>;\n\n  render() {\n    const { stuffFromContext } = this.conte…",

          "description": "The main reason for using interfaces is to achieve polymorphism and to provide developers with the ability to implement interface methods in their own way in the future.\nIn this example I will use TypeScript and I will put the repository at the end of the note\nSuppose we have an interface and three classes:\n\nThis is the connector interface.\nNow we are going to implement the Wifi communication.\n\nHere we have developed our concrete class called WifiConnector which has its own implementation of type Connector.\nNow we are creating our System which has a Connector component. This is called dependency injection.\n\n\nConnector is an interface and must have the method doConnect().\nNow, since Connector is an interface, the System class has much more flexibility.\nWe can pass any type that has implemented the Connector interface.\nFor example, now the developer wants to add a Bluetooth  connection module:\n\nWe see that WifiConnector and BluetoothConnector have their own implementation.\nSo we can pass any of them to the System class as a constructor parameter. This is called polymorphism.\nThe System class is now not aware of whether it is Bluetooth or Wifi. We can even add another communication module such as Infrared, Bluetooth5 and whatever, simply by implementing the Connector interface.\nThis is called Duck Typing. The connector type is now dynamic since doConnect() is just a placeholder and the developer implements it as their own.\nHere is the repository in case you need it and thanks for reading!",

However, if the above code is saved in a .tsx file (In my context, within a React application, while trying to create a generic custom hook), you will receive with the following error when hover over  <T>:\nJSX element 'T' has no corresponding closing tag.ts(17008)\nCannot find name 'T'.ts(2304)\n\nTo resolve the issue, I started with researching on how to properly define a generic function in TypeScript. Perhaps I made a mistake somewhere in the above syntax. I landed on two articles here and here. Both of  them talked about how to create a custom React hook that uses…",
