So this is the lab 03, which I have to create 2 parallel branches to work on different aspects of the program.\nFirst off, I needed to decide what to add to my program. At the time, I had a few options like changing code block, or hr, or exit code for my program... So I thought that the exit code is a must that my program needed to have and the code block thing is quite more interesting than hr. After choosing what I needed to do, I had to file 2 issues so I had something to refer back to. \nThe 2 issues I was talking about:\nFirst one\nSecond one\nWriting code for these 2 issues are quite straightforward. It took me a few minutes to finish it. However, I'm not so sure about the inline code block thing, and should ask my professor about it to make sure that's what he's looking for. \nSo, for the first issue, I created a new branch called issue-18 and issue-19 for the second issue. When finishing the first issue, I had to git add and git commit and switched to branch issue-19 to continue coding. As I've done it, I also had to git add and git commit. After that, I had to use merge to merge those 2 branches. \nI used git merge issue-18 which is my first issue, git had no problem merging it. It was fast forward right away. However, for the second issue, when I git merge issue-19, instead of fast forward, Git used three way recursive strategy. Then, I just needed to push it to github so the code will be visible to everyone. \nProject Repo\nCommit 1\nCommit 2",

This came in the form of dynamic, one-time passwords (OTP) held on physical fobs.\nOTPs eventually developed into two protocols: time-based OTPs (TOTP) and cryptographed hash-based message authentication codes or HMAC OTPs (HOTP). Dynamic OTPs are still widely used as an authentication protocol.\nThe late 1990s brought single sign-on (SSO) into use.

With the recent rise of remote work and stories about system breaches, computer security has become a topic of discussion even among laypeople.\nAfter trying to explain public-key cryptography and digital signatures to some clients with varying degrees of success, I wanted to develop an analogy that explained them and was easy to remember.

To be honest, I am able to know Git can do so many things out there, working with multiple branches in parallel is an example of this week.\nSpeaking of the inline code block, I simply added another regex inside my splitInParagraphs function, which finds the text enclosed with backtick and then converting it to <code>..text..</code>. Thanks to my previous lab, I already had the idea of adding new features inside my program later one. I also use another regex to support converting --- to <hr> tag.\nWhen I satisfy and try to test my program, everything works perfectly as I expect, then merging into my main branch. At first, the inline code block was merged smoothly with a fast-forward. However, when I merged the horizontal rule, it caused conflict because I modified the file for the second time with different issue, the content of the file is newer so it did not allow me to merge at that time. \nVSCode is really amazing, it detects my problem, and it shows some options I could do, which is Compare or Overwrite. I try both option in order to know the reason why I could not merge my second branch. I fix it by overwriting on my current file, and the branch is merged successfully.\nThis lab gives me a chance to practice with merge conflicts, and I am able to know what to do when I face the same problem again.",

For multiple images, please see the Galleria.\n\nThere are over 30 improvements in this release, defect fixes are mostly based on community feedback so thank you for helping us to make the library better.\nPrimeNG is licensed under MIT and free to download at NPM.\nOur current focus is on improving accessibility by creating a dedicated section per component for keyboard support and screen readers along with scores from audit tools.",

As JavaScript developers, it‚Äôs important to work with type-safe dictionaries because there will be conflicts or unexpected issues if we store different types of data within the same dictionary.\nIn this article, we‚Äôll cover how to build a type-safe dictionary using TypeScript.\nFirst of all, we need to know what a dictionary is. In a programming language, a dictionary is a typical data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. JavaScript, however, does not offer a Dictionary type. Thankfully, we can create a type-safe dictionary in a few simple ways.\nObject types in JavaScript\n\n\nThere are two primary ways to create a dictionary in JavaScript: using the Object type and using key-value pairs.

          "description": "Using reducers in the React Context api leaves a lot of room for error, even when using TypeScript. A reducer takes a single argument and returns a state. The common format for the argument is an object with an action property and a payload or value property. The action's value is generally a string such as setTitle. In the case of action:'setTitle', the value would then be the title you want to set on the state object. The problems with this approach are:\nYou have to look back at the reducer to see what the correct spelling and valid values of action are.\nThere is no type checking of the values that are linked with the action.\nThis article assumes that you have a basic familiarity with React, useReducer, and TypeScript.\nIf you just want to skip to the code, you can see the final working v‚Ä¶",

          "description": "This library is great for displaying the 'active' users of your React application. The responsiveness of react-avatar-group is meant to be similar to the Google Docs user icons. Some live examples are available here.\nIf you need a more in-depth tutorial on using this package with actual, live users, check out this post here. Otherwise, here's a quick walk-through on how to use this package.\n\nFirst, install the package:\nnpm install react-avatar-group\n\nThen open up your React file and import the package, as follows:\n// App.tsx\nimport AvatarGroup from 'react-avatar-group';\n\nexport default function App(){\n  <AvatarGroup\n    avatars={[\n      \"James\", \n      \"Ava\", \n      {\n        avatar: \"Jackson\",\n        fontColor: \"FF00FF\",\n        tooltip: \"This is a custom tooltip\"\n      }\n    ]}\n  />\n}\n\nThe only required prop to the AvatarGroup component is avatars, which is an array of strings or IAvatar objects, for more customization.\nAnother important prop is max. This will hide the avatars beyond a certain length with a custom overflow avatar (as seen in the gif above). displayAllOnHover will show all minions passed when the mouse hovers the avatar group, if there is a max number passed.\nAll the props for react-avatar-group can be seen here.\nUsing these other props, your AvatarGroup may look like the following:\nimport AvatarGroup from 'react-avatar-group';\n\nexport default function App(){\n  <AvatarGroup\n    avatars={[\n      \"James\", \n      \"Ava\", \n      {\n        avatar: \"Jackson\",\n        fontColor: \"FF00FF\",\n        tooltip: \"This is a custom tooltip\"\n      }\n    ]}\n    initialCharacters={1}\n    max={3}\n    size={60}\n    displayAllOnHover\n    shadow={2}\n  />\n}",

Redux Toolkit, which Mark helped create, is a relatively new library that aims to be the \"official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.\" This post will go into my thoughts on the benefits and potential drawbacks of Redux Toolkit.\nIt's unopinionated. Redux requires you to put your global state in a store, and to manage that state via reducers and actions. An action is a simple JavaScript object with a type property, and a reducer is a pure function that transforms the old state into the new state based on an action. Beyo‚Ä¶",
