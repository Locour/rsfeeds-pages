          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

I was assigned to create the backend for the project, and my friend would make the web client.\nI set three requirements for myself before starting to work on the server. First and foremost, I wanted to get the MVP out as soon as possible. Secondly, I wanted to make the server as lightweight as possible to just leave it running on a cheap VM.

          "description": "Hal menarik yang disediakan oleh Javascript salah satunya adalah kita dapat melakukan proses secara tidak sinkron (asynchronous) sehingga tidak terjadi saling tunggu antar proses. Dalam praktiknya, proses asynchronous ini digunakan untuk proses-proses yang waktu tunggunya tergantung pada hal di luar proses itu sendiri, seperti koneksi internet, kecepatan penyimpanan, dll. Contoh proses yang dapat dilakukan secara asynchronous:\nQuery database\nMengambil data dari web lain (HTTP Request)\nMenulis/membaca isi file\nMengirim email\nSelengkapnya baca di:\nhttps://hadihammurabi.hashnode.dev/javascript-tips-1-menunggu-beberapa-proses-asynchronous-dengan-promiseall\nTerima kasih sudah baca.\nKalau mau diskusi, komen aja.

As such, it demands continual improvement in order to stay relevant and competitive. Improvement, however, requires measurement. KPIs are measurements that allow DevOps leaders to see where their teams are, and map out where they are going.\nKPIs are metrics that help everyone in an organization from the engineer to the CTO, CIO or CISO. When people at all levels are on the same page, using the same data to build upon, progress happens more easily and quickly. The engineering team uses the information to improve, while the executive team uses it to make decisions that reshape the DevOps in the organization.\nKPIs also align everyon…",

It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.\nVim is often used by programmers on Linux. But it can be used on Mac OS X and Windows too.\n\nVim is a powerful text editor that runs in a terminal, yet can be used to edit any kind of file. It's old, it's weird, and it's hard to learn but also one of the most powerful tools for editing code on any operating system.\nSo what about commands?\nHere's a handy cheat sheet to help you get started with the editor. \n\n\n\nCursor Movement\n\n\n\n\n\nh\nmove cursor left\n\n\nj\nmove cursor down\n\n\nk\nmove cursor up\n\n\nl\nmove cursor right\n\n\nw\njump forwards to the start of a word\n\n\nb\njump backwards to the start of a word\n\n\n\nTo write and to use commands press ESC for command mode or i for insert mode.\nTo save, open and quit a file:\n\n\n\nBasic editor commands\n\n\n\n\n\n:e filename\nedit a file in a new buffer\n\n\n:w\nwrite (save) the file, but don't exit\n\n\n:wq\nwrite (save) and quit\n\n\n:x\nwrite (save) and quit\n\n\n:q\nquit (fails if there are unsaved changes)\n\n\n:q!\nquit and throw away unsaved changes\n\n\n:qa\nquit all buffers and windows\n\n\nZZ\nwrite (save) current file, if modified, and quit\n\n\nZQ\nquit without checking for changes\n\n\n\nYou can copy and paste text too:\n\n\n\nCut and Paste\n\n\n\n\n\nyy\nyank (copy) a line\n\n\n2yy\nyank (copy) 2 lines\n\n\np\nput (paste) the clipboard after cursor\n\n\nP\nput (paste) before cursor\n\n\ndd\ndelete (cut) a line\n\n\n2dd\ndelete (cut) 2 lines\n\n\n\nThere are quite a few commands you have to memorize to use Vim effectively, which can be overwhelming when you’re learning. \nYou can use these exercises to memorize commands.",

This stroke actually has a venerable history, going back to about 1983, as an exercise I was assigned as a teaching assistant for a graduate course in computational geometry. The instructor’s company recently obtained a very expensive tablet. This system allowed users to scan or load drawings already in electronic form into a display and annotate them with hand-drawn notes using a fixed-width stroke. The instructor had an idea for a variable-width (speed-dependent) stroke that would be the basis for a number of lab exercises. My job was to get his idea working in Fortran (yes, now you ca…",

          "description": "⌨️ Improve the User Experience (UX) of an e-commerce application by implementing animations utilizing Angular animations, CSS animations, and Web Animation APIs.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \nDevelopers can use animations in meaningful and non-distracting ways to significantly improve their application's user experience (UX). This blog post discusses four effective techniques to animate your application's user interface, covering popular use cases. You'll learn how to transform bland experiences into memorable ones for your users.\nI created a demo application to help you focus on adding animations to Angular. You'll add animations to a starter app as you progress through this tutorial. The starter application uses Tailwind to take care of its style and layout, but none of the animations discussed here are dependent on it.\nFollow this tutorial without cloning any repo, right in the browser using Stackblitz or CodeSandbox.\nIf you prefer to work locally in your IDE, clone the demo app and check out its starter branch:\ngit clone -b starter git@github.com:auth0-blog/angular-animations-storefront.git\n\nOnce you clone the repo, make angular-animations-storefront your current directory:\ncd angular-animations-storefront\n\nInstall the project's dependencies:\nnpm i\n\nRun the project locally:\nnpm run start\n\nAngular comes with a powerful animation module that lets you quickly add motion to your application: BrowserAnimationsModule. Under the hood, this module uses the Web Animations API (WAAPI) to create motion and interactivity. Whenever WAAPI isn't available, BrowserAnimationsModule falls back to using CSS keyframes. Angular animations give you the option to use their abstraction layer to animate any properties that the web considers animatable such as positions, sizes, colors, and many more.\nRead more...",
