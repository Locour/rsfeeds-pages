I wasn't surprised though; I expected this to happen. While there are several things you could do to resolve this, I'm going to present a solution using the NodeJS worker_threads module.

Once you logged into Azure, Navigate to Azure Container Registry by clicking on New --> Search --> type Azure Container Registry. After that create a new ACR by filling in all details you want to add but make sure you enable admin access. After Two or three minutes your ACR will be created.\nOnce you created a resource navigate Access Keys to get the Login server, Username, and password which is required for the command line push your local Docker image to ACR.\n\nType Above fig command and replace [login-server] with your ACR resource EG: firstapp.azureacr.io [username] with firstapp and [password] with the hash password. Once completed, you should see Login succeeded! Message. After this you need to build your docker image with this command\ndocker build –f ./Dockerfile . –t node_vue_app\n\n\nFinal step is to push your local Docker image to ACR. Follow below image command to push. Keep in mind though that these repositories are private by default, which means that you have to perform authentication first.\n\nAnd that’s it. You can make use of this container registry just like you used. In Part 2 we will see how we can deploy same thing using CI/CD with GitHub Workflow",

          "description": "Programming is just one big cycle. Create or download a project, install your dependencies, build something amazing, and move on to the next one. However, with node.js projects, there's a glaring problem.\nEvery time you move on to another project, you leave incredible amounts of data in the node_modules folder that you may never use again. This can add up... quite quickly.\n\nDon't despair! There's an easy fix, and it's called npkill.\n / \n        npkill\n      \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasily find and remove old and heavy node_modules folders ✨\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nThis tool allows you to list any node_modules directories in your system, as well as the space they take up. You can then select which ones you want to erase to free up space. Yay!\nFeatures\nInstallation\nUsage\n\nOptions\nExamples\nSet Up Locally\nRoadmap\nKnown bugs\nContributing\nBuy us a coffee\nLicense\nClear space: Get rid of old and dusty node_modules cluttering up your machine.\nVery fast: NPKILL is written in TypeScript, but searches are performed at a low level, improving performance greatly.\nEasy to use: Say goodbye to lengthy commands. Using npkill is as simple as reading a list of your node_modules, and pressing Del to get rid of them. Could it be any easier? ;)\nMinified: It barely has any dependencies.\nYou don't really need to install it to use it…\nView on GitHub\nIt's an easy CLI that provides a user friendly interface to scroll through all of your node_modules folders, and, if necessary, delete some at the click of the button.\nPersonally, I think it's an incredibly cool and useful tool, and I'm sure you will too! To get started, just type:\nnpx npkill\n\nAnd start freeing space!",

Trivy detects vulnerabilities of OS packages (Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, etc.) and language-specific packages (Bundler, Composer, npm, yarn, etc.). In addition, Trivy scans Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files such as Terraform, Dockerfile and Kubernetes, to detect potential configuration issues that expose your deployments to the risk of attack.\nYou can scan your Terraform configuration artifacts easily giving you the confidence that all is well with your configuration before deploying your Terraform (IaC) configurations.

To list everything in the directory, run this command:\nls -l\n\nthe 'cat' commands displays what is inside a file. Simply run this command:\ncat (name of file)\n\nThe cat command also can do other things. 👇\nUsing this command, you can also create a file.\nWhat I did below was I created the file, typed out what I needed to, then viewed the fil…",

It improves user experience of the application. In this article I will cover how to implement infinite scroll with API in Angular 12 with the help of RxJS Operators.\nA question comes in mind that how it works internally. It works like there is a big list say 10k items are there. Displaying all those items in once is not possible as it will break the application. And you can not put numbering pagination as that will look bad on the place or you have dropdown (dropdowns can not number paginations).\nIn that case you need infinite scroll.

          "description": "If you are developing an application which has to display timestamp for posts/comments/notifications, you might come across this requirement where you have to format time in \"from now\" format. This is sometimes called timeago or relative time. \nYou can either use a third party library like dayjs or momentjs for this, but for small projects, it is better to come up with your own utility function. In this tutorial we will write a util function which will accept a javascript Date object/ a string in ISO YYYY-MM-DD format/ or a date timestamp and convert it to relative time.\nEg:  2020-10-15 will be converted to \"an year ago\"\n\nJavaScript Date objects represent a single moment in time in a platform-independent format.It is is fundamentally specified as the number of milliseconds that have elapse…",

          "description": "I recently got the opportunity (and the privilege!) of starting a greenfield project at my current company, involving an frontend application for an internal tool. The devs involved had the chance to choose the tech stack that we considered convenient, and we collaboratively wrote an RFC (Request for Comment) and presented it to the rest of the company to open up our choices to discussion.\nOne of the main points that came up -after settling for React, the lingua franca framework at our company- is how we would handle state management. Our main application uses Redux, but many other alternatives were brought up: MobX, using native hooks (a combination of useReducer + useContext), using Redux plus Redux Toolkit. I even got to know and proposed Recoil, a super exciting project -and definitely…",
