          "description": "It is not easy to start programming in Python, but it is worth the effort. Some people say that Python is easier to learn than other programming languages because it has less syntactic distinctions.\nYou can compare Python with other programming languages, but the readability of its code makes it easier for beginners to start their journey in coding. It also has a well-documented syntax that makes it easier for learners to understand the language.You can start learning python from Pythonscholar.com they explain each topic with multiple examples.\nPython is one of the most popular programming languages that can be learnt by anyone. It is especially popular for scientific computing and data science due to its simplicity.\nPython was created in 1991 by Guido von Rossum. It has an easy syntax with which you can write up to 100 lines of code without needing to use curly brackets {} at the end of each line.For more dept about python history you guys can refer this artical in what is python.\nThe environment for Python is cross-platform, so if you are working on Linux or Windows, you will find Python coding very similar to what you are used to. The downside is that it takes longer than other languages like C++ or Java, but once you learn it, Python will become your favorite language because it's flexible and able to solve many problems that many other languages cannot.\n—\n\nPython is a very powerful and popular programming language. It is used in websites, games, and even the International Space Station!\nPython is easy to learn for beginners because it has a simple syntax and gets rid of the need for semicolons. Python also doesn't require any import statements when writing programs.",

          "description": "Backstory\n\n\nHave you ever experience difficulties in software development due to unsupported / different version ? Recently I was facing the same issue. The issue was a different Node.js version from my machine (Node v14.18.0) with my company project repository (Node v10 required). The first solution that instantly pop up in my mind was \"I think downgrade my current node by uninstalling it will do the work\", But what if you need another version for another project in the near future? Do you want to endure the pain of installing and uninstalling Node.js every time you need a different version of it ? \n\nNVM is a version manager for Node.js, it allows you to quickly install and use different versions of node via the command line.\nLet's head to the tutorial !\nIf you happen to use UNIX, macOS, or WSL (Window Sub-system for Linux), you can install and read the official documentation here\nIf you happen to use Windows you can install it at NVM for windows which is developed by Corey Butler, download the nvm-setup.zip file.\n \n\nAfter the installation you can open your command prompt and check whether nvm is recognized\nC:\\Users\\YourUsername>nvm -v\n\nRunning version 1.1.8.\n\nIf nvm is not recognized as internal command or external command, try to re-open your command prompt.\nThen, You can type nvm list in order to see list of Node.js version on your machine.\nC:\\Users\\YourUsername>nvm list\n\n  * 14.18.0 (Currently using 64-bit executable)\n    10.18.0\n\nIf you don't see your desired Node.js version in the list, you can use nvm install command, for example if you want Node.js version 8, you can type nvm install 8.0.0\nTo use the installed Node.js version you can simply type nvm use 8.0.0\nIf you see an error message exit status 5: Access is denied., It is due to admin privilege issue. To solve it you can simply run your command prompt as administrator. \nThank you for your time reading this short article / tutorial about Node Version Manager, hope it helps! and Have a great day.",

Today, I found a new resource which lets you create serverless functions for absolutely free! Vercel. So, lets build & deploy our first Serverless function on it!\nThe platform requires us to install its CLI in order to develop & deploy our functions. Lets do npm i -g vercel to install the CLI globally. After creating a new directory, we'll initialize it as a new node project.\n\nVercel cli expects us to put all of our .js files in a folder called /api.\n.js files will contain 1 default exported function which represents a REST API endpoint taking 2 parameters request & response representing the express's Request & Response objects respectively (just like in normal express.js GET/POST endpoints).\n/api/{name-of-file}\nSo I have created a basic node.js project with following files:\n\n\n\n\"But how I will develop them without even testing?\"\nThe vercel cli which we just just installed globally provides a functionality to run the functions on our own local machines.\nYou will be required by the CLI to login/signup into a vercel account, join me from here after completing that ;)\nvercel dev. For the first time running the cli, it requires us to do some quick configs & settings, after completing that you should see something like this:\n\nTo check how the functions are working locally, we have to go to http://localhost:3000/api & to access the endpoint in hello.js, we will go to http://localhost:3000/api/hello\n\n\nEverything looks awesome! lets deploy it on vercel!\nVercel's CLI makes deploying functions as easy as running a command on the terminal, we'll now run vercel on our terminal in the root of the directory.\n\nHERE YOU GO!\n\nYou can check limits for a free plan set by the platform here.",

We'll look at the changes and how they impact your web application environment.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \nOctober is National Cyber Security Awareness Month. On top of that, OWASP just celebrated its 20th anniversary. To celebrate, we’re going to run through the newly updated OWASP TOP 10 to remind everyone of how you can better protect your applications, your businesses, and your customers from unlawful and damaging cyber attacks. We’ll also be highlighting where the updates were made and why and throw in some tips on how strengthening your identity solution can help mitigate these threats.\nThe new Top 10 is still a working draft, and OWASP is soliciting feedback on errors and corrections.\nThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organization that was set up to help raise awareness around web application security and provides guidance on how to incorporate preventative measures into your applications, infrastructure, and internal processes.  \nThey have several projects, including an insecure JavaScript application used for security training, but the one that we’re focusing on today is the newly updated 2021 edition of their list of the top 10 threats to web app security.  \nUpdated regularly, the OWASP Top 10 lists the main security threats that affect web applications today. Each entry enumerates the threat, shows possible attack vectors, and highlights preventive measures to reduce the risk of such threat. At Auth0, we take steps to mitigate most of the issues outlined below, so when you delegate your authentication needs to us, a lot of this is already taken care of for you.\nLet’s run through the list, looking at the threats and what we could be doing to make sure our own applications are secure and examining some features of the Auth0 platform that help to mitigate or entirely remove such threats.\nFor a high-level overview of the list updates, please refer to this handy chart, provided by OWASP:\n\nRead more...",

          "description": "So what is Kubernate?\nThink of it as a mix between Helm and Pulumi. It is a library that is used to generate Kubernetes YAML files with ease. Think like Helm but with actual code instead of templates. You have the power to generate anything you want while using any kind of input you want. Everything is evaluated at \"build\" time and the output is 100% static valid Kubernetes YAML. You also get to leverage the tooling built for Typescript (which is actually very good) while building and DEBUGGING your deployments. You can also publish \"libraries\" built with Kubernate to NPM and other Kubernate-based projects can use them as building blocks.\nThere is no programming model to speak of :) just write code and use it. In the end, the tool runs the code :) You can even skip this step and just build the Typescript into javascript and run it with Node. You can even make your own app on top of Kubernate to manage your deployments.\nIt is written in Typescript and it is very easy to use. It is also very easy to learn and understand. Everything is typed! Just follow the IntelliSense.\nCheckout the Github repo or the homepage for more.\nYou can join our Discord Community server (https://discord.gg/4mzndma4SN) to get new updates about development and also talk to the contributors for any questions you might have :)",

Creating ready-to-run recipes for later use? Sweet. But once you start using these scripts for more advanced things, you run into some unfortunate Bash quirks.

The return keyword doesn't do the same thing as in other languages.\nReturning arrays from functions is not really possible. As a bad but easy workaround, you can pass array return values via a global variable.\nKeep your whitespace in mind. Confusingly, if [ FOO=='bar' ] will overwrite the value of $FOO. if [ FOO = 'bar' ] will perform a string equality check.\nAlternatively, for complex tasks, you'll probably have an easier time using a different scripting language like Python, Ruby or Perl.\nUnofficial bash strict mode\nYour bash scripts are rubbish, use another language",

To do this, run following command in a terminal.\nsudo systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd\n\nThen disable systemd-timesyncd, run following command in a terminal.\nsudo systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd\n\n\nFirst, set 'enable' for systemd-timesyncd.

          "description": "So what is Kubernate?\nThink of it as a mix between Helm and Pulumi. It is a library that is used to generate Kubernetes YAML files with ease. Think like Helm but with actual code instead of templates. You have the power to generate anything you want while using any kind of input you want. Everything is evaluated at \"build\" time and the output is 100% static valid Kubernetes YAML. You also get to leverage the tooling built for Typescript (which is actually very good) while building and DEBUGGING your deployments. You can also publish \"libraries\" built with Kubernate to NPM and other Kubernate-based projects can use them as building blocks.\nThere is no programming model to speak of :) just write code and use it. In the end, the tool runs the code :) You can even skip this step and just build the Typescript into javascript and run it with Node. You can even make your own app on top of Kubernate to manage your deployments.\nIt is written in Typescript and it is very easy to use. It is also very easy to learn and understand. Everything is typed! Just follow the IntelliSense.\nCheckout the Github repo or the homepage for more.\nYou can join our Discord Community server (https://discord.gg/4mzndma4SN) to get new updates about development and also talk to the contributors for any questions you might have :)",

          "description": "If you’ve ever faced such temptation to wrap inner exceptions within some neatly-defined exception type, you’d better off fight the devil. Let exceptions be themselves and freely fly high the call stack. 💸\nTo elaborate on the issue, consider the hypothetical DataProcessor and the general purpose exception type DataProcessingFailure below:\nclass DataProcessingFailure extends Error {\n  constructor(public innerError: Error) {\n    super();\n  }\n}\n\nclass DataProcessor {\n  process() {\n    try {\n      // Some processing\n    } catch (err) {\n      throw new DataProcessingFailure(err)\n    }\n  }\n} \n\nHere, the process() method only raises a DataProcessingFailure exception, if any. Whatever exception occurs (e.g., DivisionByZero) the caller of process() just catches a DataProcessingFailure instance. So, DataProcessingFailure is a wrapper exception.\nThe reason behind advising against wrapper exceptions is the change of behavior that you exert on the downstream system seen by higher level controllers. For instance, you could mask a well-defined exception that itself is an intricate part of the domain model. Another example is when your wrapper could mask network related exceptions, most of which resolve just by retrying, albeit if some caller at higher level of call stack could catch them as they are.\nPutting it all together, you’d logically prefer minimizing footprints/side-effects of various components/implementations on each other, so that you could avoid unwanted couplings/special-treatments.\nAbout Regular Encounters\n\nI’ve decided to record my daily encounters with professional issues on a somewhat regular basis. Not all of them are equally important/unique/intricate, but are indeed practical, real, and of course, textually minimal.",

This means that you can use global packages in all of your services but if you use some package in the frontend app you don’t need to install it for the backend one.

          "description": "console.log is useful in a lot of situations (although there are usually better ways to debug if that's what you're doing).\nIn the browser console.log works well with objects, you can drill down as much as you need. But in Node.js, when you look at the output of a nested object, you'll often see this:\n$ console.log({a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}})\n\n{ a: { b: { c: [Object] } } }\n\nd: {} was replaced with [Object]. But why?\nIt's because the command line / terminal doesn't have a nice UI for drilling down, so Node attempts to print up to three levels deep. Beyond three levels it just prints [Object].\nThis is controlled by a variable in the node 'util' module, called depth, which defaults to 2. You can set it yourself here:\nrequire('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = 0; // top level only, e.g.:\n// { a: [Object] }\nrequire('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = null; // print everything, e.g.: \n// {\n//  a: { b: { c: { d: {} } } }\n// }\n\nIt's not a great idea to change an underlying variable, as it might come back to bite later. So a cleaner way is to convert the JSON object to a string and log that. We can use node's built in JSON class and the stringify method:\ncomplexObject = {a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}}\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(complexObject, null, 2))\n\n// {\n//   \"a\": {\n//     \"b\": {\n//       \"c\": {\n//         \"d\": {}\n//       }\n//     }\n//   }\n// }\n\nNote that the 3rd parameter of JSON.stringify, Number 2, controls the number of spaces of indentation, and the 2nd parameter can be used to filter or adjust the objects and properties shown.\nNow you can really see what's in those deep Objects.",
