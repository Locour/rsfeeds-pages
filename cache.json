It pulls together all of your system information and strips out the crap and displays it in a way that doesnt hurt the brain....\nInstalling NeoFetch is as easy as typing the following two commands....\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:dawidd0811/neofetch\n\n\nand\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install neofetch\n\n\nthis add the official NeoFetch PPA to your ubuntu installation and means you will always get the most up to date version.\nafter that simply type neofetch in your terminal and you will get a screenshot like below.\n\nAnother app you can use is screenfetch which does near enough the exact same thing!.\nInstall it with the following command:\nsudo apt install screenfetch\n\n\nand then just type screenfetch in your terminal to get your system specs like below.\n\nWell thats going to do it today hope this quick blog post will be of interest and help you out. as a side note you can also get Screenfetch for MacOS.\n \nRaspada-Blog\n  I post on my blog primarily and share the posts via API, please check out Raspada-Blog for more posts and information.

But if you have requirement to remove a new-line in terminal we have -n option in echo. or If you have some other requirement to do operations like New-line, Backspace & Tabulation. Then we have a options called -e stand for Sequence and you have to pass a sequence Character in string\nFor Example :-\n    echo -e \"Hello\\nWorld\" = To add a New-line.\n    echo -e \"Hello\\bWorld\" = To Backspace a letter.\n    echo -e \"Hello\\tWorld\" = To add a Tabulation.\n\nAfter know this syntax we are able to create live running time Clock. So let's begin .\necho $(date +%r) = It will give the output of this date command format.\necho -e \"$(date +%r)\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\" = It will backspace the output (if command not work use below one).\necho -n  -e \"$(date +%r)\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\" = It will backspace the output (Why we have to do this you will know in a minute).\necho -n  -e \"$(date +%r)\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\" = It will backspace all the output of command.\necho -n  -e \"$(date +%r)$(sleep 1)\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\\b\" = It will add 1s delay in command.\nNow we have to add this thing in Loop.

          "description": "So, recently I ran into an issue where one of my functions was not being implemented \"at the correct time.\" The solution was to trigger it in another component via ngOnInit.\nMoving the code was simple, but in the process I ran into an issue that I've seen before but not dug into.\nThe issue is that I like to use fat-arrow functions in my code (() => {}) and somewhere along the way I converted an ngOnInit to fat-arrow. I unknowingly broke the OnInit lifecycle hook complete.\nngOnInit = async (): Promise<void> => {\n  await this.init();\n  ...\n};\n\nThe fix was actually pretty simple, I converted the code back to a traditional function pattern ...\nasync ngOnInit(): Promise<void> {\n  await this.init();\n  ...\n}\n\n... and my function started working again.\nBe careful (yes, I am telling myself this) as you may inadvertently write code that does not execute correctly. It was a simple mistake and one that was hidden by some layers of async behavior.",

          "description": "Suppose you have the requirement that you want to show list of users if the url is /user, and you want to show user detail of a particular user when the URL is /user/useId.\nTo achieve this we can create a users component, then in its ngOnInit we could check if params are present.\n/// Here route is ActivatedRoute\n\nthis.route.queryParams.subscribe(params => {\n\nif(params.userId){\n//// Do Something\nconsole.log(params.userId);\n}\n});\n\n\nYou can get the params like this and then write your logic accordindly. If params are present then show userDetails if not then list of users.\nLike So\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  { path: '/user', component: UsersComponent },\n  { path: '/user:userId', component : UserDetailsComponent}\n];\n\nHere we are explicitly stating that if url is /user then show UsersComponent or if it is like /users/xxxid then show userDetials page.\nThis is more Systematic & preferred way of doing the task.\nIf you are using only one parameter then use parameterized route. But if you have many parameters then use querry Params as stated above in solution 1.\n<a *ngFor=\"let user of users\"\n  routerLink=\"/user/{{user.id}}\">\n  {{user.name}}\n</a>\n\nAssume we are having list users and clicking on a user name will open that particlular user details.\nTo get the value of ther parameter use ActivatedRoute\nconsole.log(this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('userId');\n\nPoints To remember\nIf you are getting any error remember to recheck the route you had written. sometimes you append extra / like user/:userId/ or prepend extra slash (/) like /user/:userId.\nAlthough you can use more then two parameters\nlike  user/:userId/:id/:age \nI would suggest to avoid it and if it cannot be avoided atleast limit it to two parameters.",

Whereas with the second snippet, our button could be split into a separate chunk. This could be an advantage when your page gets super duper complex with 1000 states, but the button is only needed in 1 of those states.\nNow, can you tell the difference between these twos?\nasync function loadButton() {\n  const buttonModule = await import(\"@kenaz/button\");\n  return butto…",

Some require features not supported by all browsers, others require complicated tools. For my latest Mojolicious web app, I wanted to see how I could use Typescript with a minimum of fuss.\nWe'll start from a simple Mojolicious::Lite app, created using mojo generate lite_app:\nFrom there, we can install Typescript using Node. Since Typescript cannot bundle itself into a single file, we will also install Webpack:\nnpm install --save-dev typescript webpack webpack-cli ts-loader\n\nAfter installation we can configure Typescript using its tsconfig.json file. We'll use the public directory for our output, since this directory is served by Mojolicious.\n{\n  \"co…",

          "description": "Recently I had to work with some automatically generated types whilst using GraphQL. This is a very extremely useful feature! However, it can be a little cumbersome to specifically reach different custom nested types from the requests without it being too verbose.\nBut, being a little creative with some native Typescript functions we can find a way to handle this exact use case!\n\nLet’s take for example this generated type (For the sake of the example, this will be a fairly simple type with a nested subtype):\nIf we wanted to extract the type of the array without it getting too verbose we could use some conditional typing from Typescript.\n\nThe following type allows us to extract it:\nIt can be a little confusing at first glance but let’s break down every portion. First, we have our ArrayElement which is a generic receiving the array itself as T.\nHere the infer keyword from typescript (which must be used with extends) to declaratively introduce a new generic type U based on the given array.\nNow let’s assume that the TStuff type is an array and we want to extract a singular TStuff. We could then supply the type of TStuff[] to ArrayElement\ntype TNestedStuff = ArrayElement<TStuff[]>;\n\nLooking at the result of the extracted type we can now use it however we wish or even assign it as its own type to make it less verbose!\n\nHere is the code sandbox to play around with the type and the Typescript documentation :\nDocumentation - Conditional Types\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/array-type-extraction-1eohh\nIf you have any other way to extract a type from an array let me know in the comments below!\nOriginally published at https://relatablecode.com on November 21, 2021.",
