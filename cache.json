          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

It is a program for running Javascript and Typescript code outside of a browser. It is an attempt to reimagine Node.js with the advances in Javascript since 2009, including Typescript compiler. Like Node.js, Deno is basically a shell around the Google V8 JavaScript engine, although dissimilar to Node.js it includes the TypeScript compiler for its executable image. If you are still confused between Deno and Node.js, then this article is for you. Here we’ll discuss the comparison of Deno and Node.js. But before digging to the comparison let’s see the overview of each one.\nIt executes Typescript and JavaScript to asynchronous desktop servers and apps. Deno is the new implementation which uses modern features of JS language. It is a secure runtime for Typescript and Javascript that uses Google’s V8 and core is built in Rust. Here are some of the advantages of Deno.\nBenefits Of Deno-\nSupports Typescript\nUses a single executable file\nIt has a well designed module system\nBuilt-in dependency inspector\nIt has a code formatter\nIt takes care of security\nNode.js is a server-side javascript environment, based on Google’s JS engine. It is focused on the event-driven HTTP servers. Node.js is an easy-to-built platform which is a scalable and fast network application. It has an event-driven I/O model and non-blocking Node.js which makes it highly efficient. Also, it is a great solution for data-intensive and real-time apps that can run on distributed devices.       \nKnow the amazing new features of Node.js 16 at- What’s New In Node.js 16?           \nBenefits Of Node.js-\nHighly extensible\nOffers easy scalability\nCan catch single modules\n1.

          "description": "📕 Learn how to build a realtime chat application with Spring Boot, Auth0 and Ably.\n\n\nWhen developing a service, one of the main hurdles to consider is authentication. For every action, you’ll need to both authorize the user (check they are who they say they are) and then ensure they can only do actions which they have permission to do.\nAuth0, an authentication and authorization platform, simplifies this process immensely. Not only does it allow for easy integration with your own login systems, it makes integrating other login services such as Google and Twitter simple. It allows for a simple setup of permissions, roles with set permissions attached, and for these roles to be assigned to users. These users can then make use of various login systems to access the same account and thus have the same permissions associated with them.\nWith Spring Boot, this is extremely powerful, partially due to the strong integration of Auth0 with it. A simple redirect to an Auth0 login page will return a token which a Spring Boot server can use to verify the user and access their associated permissions.\nThis token can then be used to correctly generate access to other services. For example, Ably, a real-time communications solution, makes use of tokens to authenticate with an Ably App. Once a user has authenticated with Auth0 and has an Auth0 token, they can use this to request a token from a Spring Boot server to authenticate directly with Ably, with the appropriate permissions and access granted.\nIn this tutorial, we’ll be going through the basics of setting up an interoperating system as described above. The actual service we’ll be providing is a chat application, which will:\nAllow users to sign in using a Google account\nSigned in users will be able to publish messages to a group chat\nNon-signed in users will be able to subscribe and read messages published\nUsers will be able to see who is online in the chat\nUsers will, when joining, be able to load the last 20 messages of conversation they’ve missed\nRead more...",

The quickest and easiest solution that I've found is to change the password manually in the database.\n\nWordPress stores passwords in the wp_users table. The prefix may be different if you have elected to change that in the wp-config.php file. It's good practice to do that for security.\nWhen you look at the table, it'll look a little like this…\n\n\n\nID\nuser_login\nuser_pass\n\n\n\n\n1\nthomasxbanks\n$P$BHpcLw/aWsTPmeDprzXwOEl45bJm9A3\n\n\n\nWordPress stores your password as an MD5 hashed string. This prevents anyone with access to the database seeing confidential information in plain text.\nIf this wasn't obfuscated like this, we'd be able to copy our password and paste it into the login form…but we can't - and for good reason!\nSo, to fix our little problem, we need to replace the existing hashed password with a new hashed password - we can't overwrite the MD5 hash with plain text because that won't work.\nI have Hasher installed as a plugin in VS Code. If you don't use VS Code or don't want to use this extension, MD5 Hash Generator Online works pretty well.\nI would recommend that you don't create your \"forever password\" using these hash generators though. Overwrite the existing password with something easy to remember and very, very temporary - a favourite of mine is Pa55word! —\n267057150e34eca5c6af39ec9b30864e\n\nOnce the password has been changed, you can log in with your new password and immediately change it to something more secure.\nI hope this helps you as much as it has helped me. 😎",

          "description": "Scenario:\n\n\nYou encountered a production issue. Immediately you stopped doing whatever you were working on and started fixing the bug. After fixing the bug you observe that you fixed the bug on a different branch. Now you want to move a certain number of commits from a branch A to branch B.\nTo move a small number of commits from A to B, use the git cherry-pick command\nSay, you have the following branches\nP ----- Q ----- R ------ S\nF ----- G ----- H\n(Note: P, Q, R, S, F, G, H are all commit hashes/ids)\nand you want to move commits Q & R to B(in front of H). You can do the following by\ngit checkout branchB\ngit cherry-pick Q\ngit cherry-pick R\n\nThis will result in\nBranch B\nF ----- G ----- H ----- Q ----- R\nBasically, we first checkout to the branch where we want to add the commits, and cherry-pick the commits we want to move, in the order in which they appear in the first branch. Ensuring that the commits being cherry-picked are in sequential order is important or can result in complications.\nLike I said, this method works if the number of commits is small, but to move a large number of commits we can use a better method\ngit checkout <branchname where commits are to be moved>\ngit rebase --onto <SHA of most recent commit in branchB> <SHA of the commit before the commit that is to be moved> <SHA of the last commit that is to be moved>\ngit rebase HEAD <branchname where commits are to be moved>\n\nSo, for the above example - moving Q & R to branch B, the commands would be\ngit checkout branchB\ngit rebase --onto H P R\ngit rebase HEAD branchB\n\nThese two tricks should be enough for moving commits between branches.\nTo read more of such git tips visit my blog - https://pranavjoglekarcodes.web.app/blogs/posts/2021/git_tricks_1/",

          "description": "The array is still one if not the major data structure in JavaScript. Especially given the fact that Set and Map were introduced way later, many developers have grown comfortable either going with a plain array or using a library for this purpose.\nIf we now take into account that the array is the only data structure in JavaScript that comes with functional monad methods (map, filter, forEach, etc.), although there is a proposal going on to add these methods to all iterables, it's often more comfortable to go with a plain array for most purposes.\nThe JavaScript array makes no assumptions about its elements. You can mix and match types, and you can also push duplicates. But what if you only want the unique values of your array?\nGladly, there is a pretty short one-liner that makes it easy for you to filter out duplicates and get an array only containing unique values.\nYou can combine the spread operator together with the Set constructor to quickly get all unique values of an array:\nconst array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4];\n\nconst unique Values = [...new Set(array)];\n\nThere is only one issue with this code: The Set relies on the strict equality comparison (===), so it doesn't work well for objects.\nIf you like visual content more, or if you want to store it for later, I put all this into one single image for you. I hope you like it!\n\nIf you would love to read even more content like this, feel free to visit me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\nI'd love to count you as my ever-growing group of awesome friends!",

Component A, for example, may anticipate a name argument with a text data type, but component B may anticipate an age argument with a numeric data type. Likewise, D may anticipate an onClick argument with a Function data type, but C may expect a post parameter with an object data type with characteristics like title and date.\nHow can we tell our component what kind of data it should expect?\nThis may be done in various methods, but this post will focus on PropTypes and TypeScript. Despite holding identical goals, these two techniques operate in different ways. So we’ll go through what these tools are, how to use them, and tell them apart before trying more advanced techniques.\nPrior knowledge of PropTypes and TypeScript is necessary for a thorough understanding of this article. You’ll also require an integrated development environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code.\nPropTypes is a type-checking tool for props in React apps that can be used at runtime. The PropTypes efficiency has been provided through the prop-types package since React 15.5. PropTypes let you specify the props that are expected in a component, such as whether they are mandatory or optional. You’ll get a warning in the browser’s JavaScript console if you provide a different type to an element or miss a required prop:\nRead the full article Best Practices for Checking PropTypes in React Components using TypeScript:",
