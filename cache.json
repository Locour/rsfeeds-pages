Scalability, reduced response time and the ability to use the same language on server and client sides are also the proven benefits of Node.js.\nAs for now most businesses and industries choose Node.js for building their projects. Such a runtime environment is perfect for modern applications because it scales quite well without additional investments into hardware.\nREST APIs, real-time apps, single-pages and more can be easily built and executed on almost all known platforms.\nChoosing the Best Node.js Hosting Provider\nIn this guidance, we’ll go through the main aspects you should weigh before choosing the right hosting platform.\nNot all the providers support an event-driven JavaScript runtime environment and development framework, so you should do careful research to find the best Node.js hosting for your app.\nFirst of all, you should realise if you have enough time and skills for the system administration routine. If yes, you can get some cloud VM or VPS and install, deploy and manage everything on your own. But, if you prefer to focus on application code than a managed cloud hosting platform would be a perfect choice.\nGood luck ;-)",

To avoid printing the details and suppress the output, we can simply use the quiet (-q) option along with the unzip command.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to extract them to a different directory, you can use the -d option and specify the path to the destination directory. Please note that if you don’t have write access to the destination directory, you can use the sudo command to get the root privileges.\n\n\n\nIf you want to unzip a file that is password-protected, you can use the -P option along with the unzip command.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, typing the password as plain text in the terminal (command line) could be insecure.

Also I got a chance to be part of community-day for Vitess in which contributors and maintainers from all around the world interacted. \nSadly, due to an unfortunate event I was unable to work for weeks. But my mentors and the admins at CNCF were kind enough to understand my situation and granted me an extension for the program.

Linux has a huge source of tools to make a specific task easier. Not only aircrack-ng there are many other CLI based tools, that gonna help you. And one thing, docker also executes awesomely in Linux.\nLinux has a growing software for video editing which might not fulfill all our requirements. Idiots in the Linux community quarrels over distro i.e. \"my distro is better\", instead of coding a nice piece of software or staying silent. Image editing and other stuff can be tedious for you. I don't see any point in using Wine, wine just decrease the GUI appearance of the app.\nI use Ubuntu, Ubuntu is super awesome. Fool people quarrel over distros but that's not what smart linux users do.\nMost of the Linux distro arguments are about the desktop environments. You can literally install any desktop environment in any linux based OS you're using. So, let's not quarrel over Linux Distro (aka: Desktop Environment). \nLet's contribute on making software and games for Linux. Let's do it.",

E.g. we we want an new size called huge we do it like this:\ncomponents: {\n   MuiSvgIcon: {\n      variants: [\n        {\n          props: { fontSize: 'huge' },\n          style: {\n            fontSize: '5rem',\n          },\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n}\n\nThat should already work, but when we are using typescript and setting it, the compiler will complain.\n<HomeIcon fontSize=\"huge\" />\n\nSo we need to extend the interface for the component too:\ndeclare module '@mui/material/SvgIcon' {\n  interface SvgIconPropsSizeOverrides {\n    huge: true;\n  }\n}\n\nJust add the above module declaration e.g. to your theme.ts  and that's it.",

I've tried to make it approachable for beginners but it's really not for absolute beginners.\nWebsite authentication can be a very confusing topic. There are a lot of considerations when thinking about an authentication system for your web projects. It's overwhelming because authentication can be extremely simple or it can be a layer cake of individual systems that each build on top of each other.\nIn this series we're going to start with no authentication and then you'll add a very basic authentication system. Then you'll progressively add and remove layers on top of it to make it a full b…",

          "description": "TL;DR - Rename your directory build something else\nMakefile\nbuild:\n    docker build . -t my-basic-app\n\nLook. I have the most basic app, Dockerfile and Makefile. Why can't it just run make build command properly as I defined in Makefile?\nshyamajp@ubuntu:~/Projects/my-basic-app$ make build\nmake: 'build' is up to date.\n\nLet's get rid of this stupid error. At the root level, you must have a directory named build. That's why you see this unexpected behavior.\nIn my case, I can change outDir name from build to dist to avoid this specific conflict.\ntsconfig.json\n{\n    \"outDir\": \"dist\"\n}\n\nDo not name your directory same as Makefile target. Be careful with names like build and test, which are often used for both Makefile targets and directory names.\nI know this is a noob question but I've done it a few times already and I thought I might as well document it somewhere for myself. I hope this helps other newbie folks like me.\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions to make this article better. Thank you for reading. Happy Coding!",

          "description": "Getting Start template! 👉 https://github.com/laststance/vite-react-ts-extended\nThis year there has been a big movement in build tools in the JavaScript community.\n\nIn 2020, Webpack, especially in combination with Babel, seemed to be the de facto standard for build tools.\nHowever, in 2021, the popularity of a completely new development environment/build tool that does not include Webpack has skyrocketed.\nVite.\nESBuild that starts without build.\nNPM Trend, you can see that Vite has overtaken the number of downloads of create-react-app since July.\nThe Next.js team has also responded by abandoning Babel and introducing SWC, an ultra-fast TypeScript compiler, in Next v12.\nWhat does that mean for us React Developers?\nThe Vite default react-ts template lacked Jest and ESLint (Prettier integrated).\nJest comes pre-installed with React-Testing-Library, Hook-Testing-Library, MSW, and TypeScript support.\nYou can easily install and run Jest with the following commands, \nyarn\nnpx degit laststance/vite-react-ts-extended myapp\ncd myapp\nyarn install\nyarn dev\n\nnpm\nnpx degit laststance/vite-react-ts-extended myapp\ncd myapp\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n\ngithub: https://github.com/laststance/vite-react-ts-extended\nso I would be happy if you could use it as a way to build a instant React+TypeScript development environment for new libraries or anything else! 💅",
