Being an electrical engineering ,I have tried to build tools that would help understand and design electronics faster and better. Chip.io \nBut in this project I want something more complex😈, \nHowever, I don't discourage the possibility of using it to program integrated circuits🤔.\nIt's basically a nodejs project which utilizes nearley and Moo to parse the code which is then converted to a particular javascript format that simulates logic circuit.\nAll of this began while I was trying to disign a circuit in logisim and was not able to do in the way I wanted it to be. Also at that time i had already started messing out with lexer and parsers, which finally led to this project. \nBuild an interpreter that can run the code\nMultiple libraries that implements complex circuits.\nA graphic interface which can generate the code by drag n drop ( Similar to logisim )\nAbility to program integrated circuits ( sometimes 😜)\nLet me show you a sample of the program\nmodule HalfAdder([a,b]=>[s,c])\n{\n    init{\n        [s] = [0];\n        [c] = [0];\n    }\n    process {\n        [s] = XOR([a,b]);\n        [c] = AND([a,b]);\n    }\n}\nHalfAdder Adder;\n\nInput [A] = [0];\nInput [B] = [0];\nOutput [S];\nOutput [C];\n\nwire(A => Adder.a);\nwire(B => Adder.b);\nwire(Adder.s => S);\nwire(Adder.c => C);\n\n\nAnd this would produce a circuit like \n\nI don't want to go deep into the explanation but in simple terms we created a blue print for HalfAdder ,whose inputs are a and b, outputs are s and c. After which we instantiated a HalfAdder ( as Adder) which is connected to input ports A and B , Output Ports S and C\nAny suggestions and feedbacks is greatly appreciated.\nThank you ❤️ for reading.",

          "description": "There's a lot of talk lately about developer self service for Kubernetes. It looks like every vendor in the Kubernetes space now claims they offer some kind of developer self service.\nSome might disagree, but the overall opinion is that Kubernetes is not really developer friendly. Kubernetes has over 50 object types, complex RBAC and to get anything deployed, you'll need to write YAML manifest. But you also need to learn how to handle horizontal scaling, networking, secrets, ingress, and a hole lot more. The question is, why would a developer care about all this stuff. Developers don’t care about all the Kubernetes internals, they just like to get an HTTP(S) endpoint of their running application.\nOperations and SRE on the other hand have a hard time guarantee application security and avail…",

For example:\ngo from \"101\" over known reversely yield known.kdate, id($$);\n\nThe above statement starts from Vertex 101 to find all the corresponding neighbors reversely.

          "description": "Why Python packaging can be hard\n\n\nThere may be a time in your development career where you need to author a package that extends Python w/ C or C++. In such a case your Python package needs to go through a compilation process, which converts C or C++ to binaries that work for a specific target system. This becomes really tedious when you think about how many flavors and versions of Linux there are.  Building a separate binary for Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, etc... Ugh so tiring.\nWhy Python packaging can be easy w/ manylinux\n\n\nFortunately, there is a solution. manylinux was birthed to make it easy for your Python packages to be compatible with most Linux variants. manylinux takes advantage of the fact that most distributions are mindful of backwards compatibility, and intentionally builds bdist wheels on an old version of a distribution. The idea is that if we build on an old supported version, the binaries produced are compatible with current versions.\nSo what is a manylinux really? Is it a ham sandwich?\n\n\nNo. Even better. It's a Docker image. manylinux is a Docker image built off a certain old versions of the CentOS operating system that comes bundled with libraries that are assumed to be present by default on almost all Linux systems.\nYou can find an example of manylinux distributions within the pandas project. Here are two (out of many) from the list of available pandas downloads from PyPI:\npandas-1.0.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl\npandas-1.0.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_i686.whl\n\nIn this case, pandas has built manylinux wheels for CPython 3.7 supporting both x86-64 and i686 architectures. It's manylinux so this wheel should be compatible for many linux :)\nHappy packaging!",

What better way than to make it my daily driver?\nIt's been just over a month now so I figured I'd share my experience with using and installing Linux along with some of the surprises I encountered along the way.\nNow, for the record, I've used Linux before but mostly for Docker build systems at work but I haven never used it as a daily driver on my desktop machine.\nGuru or nooby - I hope you find this post useful or interesting in some way.\nI chose Void Linux as my first image. It's a very bare-bones distro, similar to Arch and Gentoo. I liked the idea of packages being audited by other developers before being allowed to be added to the registry.

Facebook created, developed, and supports this useful tool, which can be downloaded from their Github page. Facebook updates and creates new guides for this collection on a regular basis.\nAdvantages of ReactJS:\nReactJs has a lot of experience with SEO. While other Javascript does not allow SEO, you can easily run your ReactJS with the servers.\nDisadvantages of ReactJS:\nReact technologies are evolving and developing at such a rapid pace that there is no time to properly document them. To get around this, developers write their own instructions when new versions and tools in their present projects evolve.\nAngularJS:\nAngularJS is a framework for building dynamic web applications. It allows you to utilize HTML as your template language and enhance HTML's syntax to represent the components of your application clearly and succinctly. Data binding and dependency injection in AngularJS eliminate a lot of the code you'd have to write otherwise. And because it all happens in the browser, it's a great companion for any server technology.\nAdvantages of AngularJS:\nBecause Angularjs is an open-source JavaScript MVC framework, anyone can create a custom application at a low cost.\nDisadvantages of AngualrJS:\nIn Angular, there is no server authorization or authentication. Authorization is the process of granting data access authorization and identifying a user by validating credentials. Because AngularJs is unable to fulfill both functionalities, we refer to it as \"less secure.\"\nAngularJs is totally dependent on JavaScript. If these scripts are hidden, the resulting pages appear to be rudimentary.\nIt's huge and complicated.

The part that has me excited about it is the concept that you can use the same library for both frontend & backend. (provided the backend is in Rust or NodeJs.)\nSkip to source\nExpected Prerequisites:\nRust\nNodeJs\nYarn\nFirst, we need to establish the goal of this little tutorial. This tutorial is to give a little demonstration of how to simply get Webpack to compile our Rust code into WebAssembly and import it on the frontend. To get started, lets create a new folder and enter it:\nmkdir -p ./wasm-demo\ncd ./wasm-demo\n\nNow with this empty folder, lets start by adding the necessary files to get up and running.  \nIf you are curious why Yarn 2+, click here!\nFor the yarn init, you can simply select all th…",
