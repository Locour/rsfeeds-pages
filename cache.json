Should I use the ID token or the access token? ​🤔 The ID token looks nicer to me. After all, if I know who the user is, I can make better authorization decisions, right?\"\nHave you ever found yourself making similar arguments? Choices based on your intuition may sound good, but what looks intuitive is not always correct. In the case of ID and access tokens, they have clear and well-defined purposes, so you should use them based on that. Using the wrong token can result in your solution being insecure.\n\"What changes after all? They are just tokens. I can use them as I see fit. What’s the worst that could happen?\"\nLet’s take a closer look at these two types of tokens to better understand their role in authentication and authorization processes.\nAn ID token is an artifact that proves that the user has been authenticated. It was introduced by OpenID Connect (OIDC), an open standard for authentication used by many identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and, of course, Auth0. Check out this document for more details on OpenID Connect. Let's take a quick look at the problem OIDC wants to resolve.\nConsider the following diagram:\n\nHere, a user with their browser authenticates against an OpenID provider and gets access to a web application. The result of that authentication process based on OpenID Connect is the ID token, which is passed to the application as proof that the user has been authenticated.\nThis provides a very basic idea of what an ID token is: proof of the user's authentication. Let’s see some other details.\nAn ID token is encoded as a JSON Web Token (JWT), a standard format that allows your application to easily inspect its content, and make sure it comes from the expected issuer and that no one else changed it. If you want to learn more about JWTs, check out The JWT Handbook.\nRead more...",

          "description": "📚 Learn what ID and access tokens are and how to correctly use them in the OpenID Connect and OAuth context.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\"Let’s use a token to secure this API call. Should I use the ID token or the access token? ​🤔 The ID token looks nicer to me. After all, if I know who the user is, I can make better authorization decisions, right?\"\nHave you ever found yourself making similar arguments? Choices based on your intuition may sound good, but what looks intuitive is not always correct. In the case of ID and access tokens, they have clear and well-defined purposes, so you should use them based on that. Using the wrong token can result in your solution being insecure.\n\"What changes after all? They are just tokens. I can use them as I see fit. What’s the worst that could happen?\"\nLet’s take a closer look at these two types of tokens to better understand their role in authentication and authorization processes.\nAn ID token is an artifact that proves that the user has been authenticated. It was introduced by OpenID Connect (OIDC), an open standard for authentication used by many identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and, of course, Auth0. Check out this document for more details on OpenID Connect. Let's take a quick look at the problem OIDC wants to resolve.\nConsider the following diagram:\n\nHere, a user with their browser authenticates against an OpenID provider and gets access to a web application. The result of that authentication process based on OpenID Connect is the ID token, which is passed to the application as proof that the user has been authenticated.\nThis provides a very basic idea of what an ID token is: proof of the user's authentication. Let’s see some other details.\nAn ID token is encoded as a JSON Web Token (JWT), a standard format that allows your application to easily inspect its content, and make sure it comes from the expected issuer and that no one else changed it. If you want to learn more about JWTs, check out The JWT Handbook.\nRead more...",

Even though by some accounts, RSS seems to be dead, I strongly believe RSS is an important feature in the fight to keep ownership over your own content while also increasing exposure. The way I approach publishing and sharing my content, is called POSSE:\nPublish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere.\nRSS is an important part of that strategy.\nLuckily, I'm not the only one who values RSS.

          "description": "Items of the week\n\n\n\n\nTypeScript - const assertion can prevent literal types from being treated as more general types, e.g. const config = {light: \"ON\"} as const; will have light as the literal type \"ON\" instead of string, making it compatible with type {light: \"ON\" | \"OFF\"}. It'll also make light readonly. More explanation can be found on the official documentation page. \n\n\nJWT - it can be signed asymmetrically with a key pair or symmetrically with a shared secret. The latter means all parties involved use one secret for both signing and signature verification, which means any party with the shared secret could have signed the JWS - something to be taken into consideration during implementation.\n\n\nDesign & storytelling - good stories are engaging and help build empathy, adapting them to your audience and backing up the points with data could be helpful in getting buy-in during a design process. NN/g has an article on 6  rules for persuasive storytelling.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Note of the week\n\n\nOn the week 41 of 2021, I found out about a portable game console powered by a microcontroller - PicoSystem, an interesting product considering it is sporting the RP2040 just like a Raspberry Pi Pico. That's all for this week's post, thank you for reading and if you have got any feedback, do let me know by leaving a comment. Have a nice day!",
