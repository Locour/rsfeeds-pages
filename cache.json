          "description": "We all know that the application makes an API call to get data and display them. so let's see how things work. I will keep it crisp.\nFirstly, your application makes an HTTP request call to the Node server.\nNow, the Node server gets the request function and makes a call to a remote server for the requested service.\nWithout waiting for the response message from the remote server, the node immediately returns a response. which indicates the request was sent successfully.\nWhen Node receives an HTTP response message from the remote server, it calls the call back function that has been defined in the HTTP request function call.\nThis callback function returns an HTTP response message to the calling application,\nOk, now let's see this in a real-time example.\nLet's consider you are hungry and order some food, ill leave the choices to you.\nFirst, you will open the APP¬† to select our choices and place the order. (This is the HTTP request that the application makes to Node JS) \nNow the restaurant receives the order placed and forwards the order to their kitchen.\nThe restaurant would send an order accepted message to you, without waiting for the food to be actually prepared. (This is the immediate response node, which indicates the status of the request).\nFinally, when the food preparation is done, a delivery executive will be assigned for the order. (The delivery executive is the call back function that you defined in the HTTP request).\nThis executive reaches out and delivers you food. (This is the HTT response message )\nI hope, you got an high-level understanding of node calls are processed.\nThank you for being patient with me for my first post, if any beginner errors.

It provides several features that allow us to customize the application‚Äôs configuration.\nWe can use Kustomize in two ways: use the standalone version of Kustomize or use kubectl. Kustomize is a part of Kubectl since version 1.14.\nKustomize is easy to learn and use because the customization file is the same as the Kubernetes manifest. It is very handy when you work with Kubernetes. That makes the learning curve low.\nOne advantage of Kustomize is that it uses a kustomization.yaml file to customize Kubernetes manifests. That avoid us editing directly the manifests. So we can use the original manifests without needing Kustomize.\nWe will see above, the main features of Kustomize.\nWith Kustomize‚Ä¶",

          "description": "üí´ The \"magic glue\" that connects the view and the model, keeping them both in sync.\nAngular Change Detection is one of the most complex topics in software engineering and obviously in Angular as it is relying on that a lot. It can definitely be compared to the \"magic glue\" that connects the view and the model, keeping them both in sync\".\nOn a broader scale, it is a mechanism built into Angular that allows Angular to decide what actions can be performed when the state of the app changes. The good news is that most of the time, developers do not have to deal with change detection manually.\nHowever, if you find yourself caught in a loop, the only way to simplify your journey is to follow specific strategies, for example OnPush and trigger change detection manually if you need to. \nThere are four ways you can trigger change detection manually. Let‚Äôs look at them in detail:\ntick() on ApplicationRef **that activates change detection for the entire application by staying consistent and respectful to the strategy component of the change detection.\ndetectChanges() on ChangeDetectorRef  runs change detection on a current component.\nmarkForCheck() on ChangeDetectorRef controls change detection through the marked components where the OnPush strategy has been set.\nrun() on NgZone that allows you to execute a function inside the Angular zone. This function, and all asynchronous operations in that function, trigger change detection automatically at the correct time.\nHere is a very handy tip, which can simplify your life. \n\nIf you want to learn more listen to Angular Change Detection Episode at angularrocks.com",

          "description": "Topological sort is an ordering of the vertices of a directed acyclic graph, in a way that if there is an edge from a vertex A to B, then A comes before B. For example, let's say there is a set of projects and some of them depend on other projects:\n\nIn this example project B and C depends on project A, and project D depends on projects B and C. Therefore, project A must be executed first, then projects B and C, and finally project D. Resulting in this order: [A, B, C, D] or [A, C, B, D].\nNote that we start from node A because it doesn't have dependencies and repeat it, that is after A is done, B and C haven't dependencies anymore, so we can choose either one to be the next. That's why this algorithm works only on acyclic graphs.\nWe can use a modified depth-first search for this algorithm, ‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Var is a great thing. It served people well all across the world for years. But its time has passed. No one likes it anymore and now we all know it can even cause serious problems. Luckily there‚Äôs a better solution and it‚Äôs been a while since it was released (June 2015!). Why then do people still use var?\nOk, this is not about football, as some of you probably may think. Of course it‚Äôs about JavaScript. I‚Äôm a React Native developer, right? It has to be about JS.\nLet me take you to the point.\nYep, a replacement for var is obviously let and const. How is it different from this var everyone hates now? \nScope of var is the whole body of the function it‚Äôs declared in. Not a tragedy. But when it‚Äôs declared outside of a function, the scope is global. Now this is bad news. It can lead you to some unexpected or even unpredictable stuff in your code.\nScope of let and const on the other hand is only a block. A block, means i.e. a function, but also if/else statement, for/while loops, switch/case statements and whatnot. Basically, it‚Äôs between the brackets {}. So this is much more reliable and much safer to use because it stays exactly where you declared it. It won‚Äôt go outside.\nWhat‚Äôs more, const will make you sure the value of what you declared will not be changed in the future. How great is that?\nTo be honest, I don‚Äôt even remember the last time I have used var instead of let or const. I‚Äôm not sure of statistics, but it‚Äôs also less and less seen in existing legacy projects I work on. Of course var has its use cases, but there aren‚Äôt many of them and still, we can do better than that.\nOk, I won‚Äôt say more here. There have been a ton of blog posts written since let and const were first introduced, this one is more like a social experiment. I hope you already forgave me the clickbaitish title!",
