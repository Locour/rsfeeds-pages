This blog post describes the short-circuiting operators and assignments in JavaScript and how to use them.\nShort-circuiting operators only evaluate the right side of an expression when necessary. \nFor example, for the logical AND operator &&, when the left side of the operator is false, the right side of the operator will not change the result. The result is false regardless of whether the right side is true or false. Therefore JavaScript skips the evaluation of the right side and uses the value from the left side.\nThere are three short-circuiting binary operators in JavaScript:\nLogical AND (A && B): B is only evaluated if A is truthy.\nLogical OR (A || B): B is only evaluated i…",

          "description": "For as long as I can remember the recommended way to generate unique universal Identifiers in node.js was to the uuid module. These IDs are useful in all sorts of scenarios including for database keys, filenames, URLs, etc. Recently both node.js and the browser began offering nearly identical APIs that will generate 36-character version 4 uuids without any dependencies.\nAvailable in Chrome since July 2021 and coming soon other browsers is crypto.randomUUID(). There's a global crypto object that's available on the global self property. You can use that to generate a UUID like this:\nself.crypto.randomUUID();\n\nThe UUID it generates is a v4 UUID per the spec and ends up with a string that looks something like this:\n\"0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d\"\n\n\nYou want to do the same thing in node? Instead of reaching for the uuid package. As long as you're on version 14.17 or newer, you can do this:\nconst { randomUUID } = require(\"crypto\");\nrandomUUID(); // \"0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d\"\n\nIt's cool see node and the browser adopting powerful APIs for crypto and improved randomness. I'll definitely be reaching for these in the near future!\nYou can read more in the WebCrypto section in the MDN or the crypto section in the node.js docs.",

In this series we'll describe what it is and different approaches to implement it, starting from older less-secure methods and ending with modern more-secure methods.\nAuthentication is the process of determining who someone or something is. In the real world, when you give someone your ID or passport, that's a form of authentication. Online, when you enter an email/password, that's a form of authentication.\nWhile authentication processes can also be for machine-to-machine communication, in this post we'll focus on users identifying themselves to a web server - a.k.a. user authentication.\nTo simplify the problem, we need two processes:\nSome way to create new users\nSome way to identify existing users\nLet's loo…",

These IAM policies are designed for use with the AWS Web Console and therefore have more permissions to more services than most applications need access to. Instead, please create your own IAM policies for DynamoDB.\nIn order to follow least privilege security conventions, it is best practice to create your own custom IAM policy for DynamoDB access by an application. If this is something you have never done before, don't be intimidated. I got ya. To get you started, here are a few templates I created to use to enable full access to only Amazon DynamoDB table resources. \nOnce you play with these templates, you should ultimately create a new policy that narrows access down to just the operations the app needs to do on the resources it needs to do it. If all you are doing is SELECT and INSERT with the PartiQL API for DynamoDB on one table, then the only actions you should allow are these two:\n\"dynamodb:PartiQLInsert\"\n\"dynamodb:PartiQLSelect\"\nIn summary, use security best practices when designing access to Amazon DynamoDB for your apps, create your own customer managed IAM policies and do not use the AWS managed IAM policies.",

It's similar to other programs like Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text Editor or Atom.\nSo what led me to Vim\n\n\nI love new challenges and improving my productivity. VS code was pretty customized and suitable for my current needs. Maybe YouTube videos from this guy (DistroTube) was the motivation to try it out. \nEfficiency: Vim is designed to reduce how often switch from your keyboard to a mouse. They are literally keybinding for any type of operation and you can create custom keybindings too. If you type really fast, this will improve your productivity as you will really need your mouse.\nLearning Curve: Vim has quite a learning curve if you're just starting. For the first few days, my focus was shifted majorly from the code I write to the tool I use. This is going to pay off later by building up muscle memory you will be able to exit Vim in your sleep.\nA quick meme about exiting vim:\n\nConclusion\n\n\nI will continue sharing my learning experience and journey with Vim for the next few months\nWhatever editor, language or framework you use, they should be able to solve your problems effectively and efficiently. \nNeovim and it's simpler and maintained. \nDo you think it is worth the time to learn Vim?",

In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware.

Getting a system up and running is as easy as logging into a cloud portal and clicking a few buttons. \nThe problem with not knowing about operating systems is; regardless how much abstraction there is, systems are still needed.

Therefore, one does not has to work upfront with DOM or Data Object Model. Instead of that, it goes for a Virtual DOM layer. It updates only those parts of the actual DOM which is needed to update. This escalates the development speed in React instead of Angular. \nMoreover, the Virtual DOM is one of the best features to have as it resolves the issues associated with cross-browser.\nThe developers also get access to a unified API of cross-browser that runs even on old browser versions. Such excellent performance of React has made everyone not hire AngularJS developers and opt for ReactJS developers as it is becoming more and more popular than Angular.\n2. JSX…",

Those directives can be split into 2 categories:\nAttribute directives\nThey can be used to modify the appearance of behavior of Angular components and DOM elements. For example:\nRouterLink\nNgModel\nFormControlDirective\nStructural directives\nThey can be used to manipulate the HTML structure in the DOM. Using them, we can change the structure of part of the DOM that they control. For example:\nNgIf\nNgForOf\nNgSwitch\nIn this article, I will focus on the latter.\nAs I've mentioned above, there are a couple of built-in structural directives in Angular.

          "description": "Okay, so its not actually called \"specific Array combination types\", but that was the best description I had for it, before I looked it up.\nhttps://www.tutorialsteacher.com/typescript/typescript-tuple\nI'll come back to why this blew my mind today, but first, lets scroll back a bit, to some of my first steps into JS/TS programming. I started my programming career in Java, and one of the things that annoyed the hell out of me, was the fact that I could only have 1 object returned from a function (This was before the Pair class was introduced).\nBut in JS we can easily just return an array with 2 values:\nconst someFunction = () => {\n    return ['Mathias', 28];\n}\n\nAnd combined with some destructuring on the recieving, it was all nice and easy:\nconst [myName, myAge] = someFunction();\n\nUntil today I never had to add types onto a scenario like this, usually when I work with arrays, I either just do a basic string[], or when its required in complex object scenarios: Array<{name: string, age: number}>.\n[string, number]:\nconst someFunction = (): [string, number] => {\n    return ['Mathias', 28];\n}\n\nI came across this when I working with Vue2 combined with TS, and was trying to create a v-for loop over a Map, but Vue2 did not support this, so I had to come up with a different approach that supported the same end goal.\nSo this is where the new tuples came in handy! Given an example with some data in a Map:\nconst map = new Map<string, object>();\nmap.set('key1', {data: 'lots of data'});\nmap.set('key2', {data: 'more data'});\n\nI could then destructure it into an array like so:\nconst asArray = ...map.entries();\n// Yielding:\n[\n    ['key1', {data: 'lots of data'}],\n    ['key2', {data: 'more data'}],\n]\n\nAnd in order to Type this we now have:\nconst asArray: Array<[string, object]> = ...map.entries();\n\nThank you for reading this far, hope you gained something from this post.",
