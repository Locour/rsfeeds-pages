I am back with another Linux article!😊\nToday I will be going over basic commands you can use to monitor system performance! 📈📉💻\nThe 'top' command is used to display active processes and how much they are using system resources.\n\nlsof stands for list of open files- basically shows you list of files and the processes\n\n'tcpdump' is used to analyze network traffic\n'htop' is a lot like top - It's just allows you to monitor system resources or processes. As you can see, it's a bit more fancy than top\n\n'iostat' is a command that is used to monitor input/output devices, by telling you how long the devices have been active.\n\nDisplays the processes\n\nTells you how long the system has been up\n\n'free' shows you the amount of available memory you have.\n\nUsed to monitor individual tasks. Great for troubleshooting issues.\n\n'w' tells you information about users logged on and their processes\n\nThese commands can be vital for you to monitor your system, so I will be releasing a part 2 soon, as well!😆\nFor future Linux and security content, please give me a follow \n@linuxseb\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  Thank you again!😊",

          "description": "Being a coder I have never limited myself to one language, one framework and I didn’t want to have a milion code editors each specialised in different thing so I have always used VSCode. Keeping the theme, the look and feel of the editor with power of an IDE one plugin away no matter which language I want to jump into is the key factor that guided my choice.\nHowever, I have tried JetBrains’ WebStorm before and just couldn’t get rid of one huge thing haunting me, the project-wide type checking.\nIn VSCode the typescript plugin works great but it only checks files that are currently opened in the editor! Other files inside the project are not being checked until opened 😕 Now this is a huge bump, having to run the check manually through console or build the whole app in order to check if one type alternation hasn’t influenced anything else? Madness…\nThis is when I decided to research this problem — and there really is no out of the box solution! After trying every way on the internet I have finally pieced together the final solution for this problem:\n{\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n    \"tasks\": [\n      {\n        \"label\": \"tsc-watch project\",\n        \"type\": \"typescript\",\n        \"tsconfig\": \"tsconfig.json\",\n        \"option\": \"watch\",\n        \"problemMatcher\": [\"$tsc-watch\"],\n        \"group\": \"build\",\n        \"runOptions\": {\n          \"runOn\": \"folderOpen\"\n        },\n        \"presentation\": { \"reveal\": \"never\" }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\nThis is an automated task for VSCode — it runs when the project folder is opened and keeps on running, checking the whole repo real-time based on the changes you make! Finally! 🎉\nPut it in\n\n.vscode/tasks.json\n\n\n\n\nRe-open the project folder and accept the popup asking whether Automatic Folder Tasks should be allowed\nIf the popup isn’t there do:\n⌘⇧p\n-> Manage Automatic Tasks in Folder\n-> Allow Automatic Tasks in Folder\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  🎉 All done! Enjoy your VSCode with TypeScript better than ever! 🎉",
