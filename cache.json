Then go to Security in the left sidebar and search by “Less secure app access”.\nstep 4: Definitely sending emails.\ntransporter.sendMail({ from: '\"Your Name\" youremail@gmail.com', // sender address to: \"receiverone@gmail.com, receivertwo@outlook.com\", // list of receivers subject: \"Medium @edigleyssonsilva ✔\", // Subject line text: \"There is a new article.

In Haskell-land there's a lot of bleeding-edge research stuff, which is cool, but most likely not very applicable for my day-to-day work. If there's one thing that all haskellers love, it must be type-safety. That's what this post is about, bringing some type-safety to our node.js apps, more specifically express or koa apps. I'll try to point to some flaws I see in the typical way of writing express/koa apps with typescript and propose a \"better\" way.\nLet's start by defining routes we would like to implement. Suppose you are writing some CRUD operations for some \"users\" resource.

Funnily enough, at the time of writing, if you ran node -v, you would see v14.17.1 (which is an LTS version, and also considering we didn't install Node).\nSelect Shell (which is just beside Console)\nCopy and paste the following code below into Shell. On Windows, it's Ctrl+Shift+V. You can change the 16 below to any version you desire.\n\n\n\n\n  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash\n  export NVM_DIR=\"/config/nvm\"\n  [ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\"  # This loads nvm\n  [ -s \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\"  # This loads nvm bash_completion\n  nvm install 16 \n  nvm use 16\n\nWait for a while. You may choose to go to the toilet or grab a few bites in the meantime.\nAfter the code below has finished running and installing Node.js, run node -v && npm -v. You should see an updated Node.js (v16.x.x) and NPM (v8.x.x at time of writing) version. \nRun the following to test:\n\n\n\n\n echo console.log(`Node version: ${process.versions.node}`) > test.js\n node test.js\n\nYou should now see an updated/different Node version, depending on which version you installed and used earlier on.\nThat's it!

Now, type ! (exclamation mark) in the file and press tab, so the default HTML code will automatically be added by emmet.\nIf you're not aware of emmet and its useful shortcuts, check out my this article.\n\nYou can change the title tag content as per your choice.\nFor this demo, we will show the Eiffel tower's location on the map.\nSo follow the below steps.\nNavigate to https://maps.google.com/ and search for Eiffel Tower in the search box\nNow, click on the Share icon and select the Embed a map option\nClick on the COPY HTML button to copy the iframe tag into your clipboard\nNow, open the index.html file, and inside the body tag, add the copied content\n\nNow, If you open the file in the browser, you will see the map displayed\n\nThat's it about this short tutorial.\nCheck out my recently published Mastering Redux course.\nIn this course, you will build 3 apps along with a food ordering app and you'll learn:\nBasic and advanced Redux\nHow to manage the complex state of array and objects\nHow to use multiple reducers to manage complex redux state\nHow to debug Redux application\nHow to use Redux in React using react-redux library to make your app reactive.\nHow to use redux-thunk library to handle async API calls and much more\nand then finally we'll build a complete food ordering app from scratch with stripe integration for accepting payments and deploy it to the production.\n\nWant to stay up to date with regular content regarding JavaScript, React, Node.js?

Probably of most interest is the component FancyTitle which uses the default props pattern discussed in this blog post.\nNow let's get into the details of the pattern.\nWhen using TypeScript with React, it's easy enough to define optional props. With your props interface, you simply apply the optional parameter symbol ?:\ninterface IMyComponentRequiredProps {\n  someRequiredProp: string;\n  someOptionalProp?: string;\n}\n\nBut what if we want default values for our optional props in the case when they are not specified? \nA rather elegant way to do it is to define two separate interfaces, one for the required props, and one for the optional props. For example, if our component is …",

          "description": "Building (and maintaining) an acquisition funnel is something that most development teams will be asked to do at some point. This is no small task as this funnel will often be the  main entry point to the company products or services. This means that such a funnel needs to be completely reliable to avoid losing customers to bugs, and fully flexible to allow the marketing team to optimize the conversion rate. \nIn this two-part article we'll see how to accomplish that easily by using a strong programming pattern: a Finite State Machine. We'll be using React and Xstate for the implementation, but the principles can be applied to any stack really. \nToday in part 1, we'll see how to implement the state machine that powers the funnel, and building the actual steps and handling user data will be …",

In Haskell-land there's a lot of bleeding-edge research stuff, which is cool, but most likely not very applicable for my day-to-day work. If there's one thing that all haskellers love, it must be type-safety. That's what this post is about, bringing some type-safety to our node.js apps, more specifically express or koa apps. I'll try to point to some flaws I see in the typical way of writing express/koa apps with typescript and propose a \"better\" way.\nLet's start by defining routes we would like to implement. Suppose you are writing some CRUD operations for some \"users\" resource. We will use the following endpoint schema as an example.\nGET /users     => Ok<[User]>\nGET /users/:id => Ok<User> | NotFound\nPOST /users    => Ok | BadRequest\nPUT …",

This improves performance drastically. In the case of React, the reduced bundle size leads to faster initial load time, which is crucial these days with dwindling attention span.\nLuckily for us, React makes implementing Lazy Loading very easy for developers.

It's very intimidating for me to see so many huge projects that I don't feel like I'm experienced enough to help with, and try to find something in them to help fix or add to. So I wanted to start with something maybe smaller and work my way up to a larger project I am interested in.\nIt felt a lot harder to find something simple than I expected it to be, there were a lot of cool projects that looked very complicated and I wasn't really sure how to solve their issues.
