Node.js is a popular, lightweight web framework for beginners, and it is used by many big companies like Netflix and Uber.\n\n\n  \n  \n  What is NPM?\n\n\nNPM is the default package manager for Node.js projects.

Then use Gatsby to deliver a static version of your content without any risk of a hacked plugin and the ability to handle massive traffic even on small configurations like Dev (or ideally Web) FlashDrive instances.\nWe will install WordPress, add the GraphQL plugin, and install and Gatsby on FlashDrive.io to create a static website that rebuilds automatically each time your website is modified, all of that using FlashDrive's unique network and security capabilities and only using FREE dev instances on FlashDrive!\nFlashDrive.io is Free for developers, register today to try Gatsby with WordPress for free.",

If you enjoy this article, please consider joining my mailing list for more content like this one.\nTypeScript is valuable because it enables us to write safe code. Because when every type in the code is known at compile time, we can compile the code with TypeScript and perform type checking, which ensures that the code will not crash or cause errors.\nHowever, it is not always possible to know every type at compile time, such as when accepting arbitrary data from an external API. To check types at run-time or differentiate between different types, we to need narrow the types using a type guard.\nIn TypeScript, narrowing is the process of refining broad types into more narrow types. Narrowing is useful because it allows code to …",
