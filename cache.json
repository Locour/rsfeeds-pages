Instead of the client specifying which service it will use, the injector tells the client what service to use.

I had to parse and process data from an excel sheet which turned out to be pretty CPU-intensive and it blocked the NodeJS event loop, effectively freezing my server till it's done. I wasn't surprised though; I expected this to happen. While there are several things you could do to resolve this, I'm going to present a solution using the NodeJS worker_threads module. Before we start, let's quickly talk about this thread thing. The code used in this article is available here.\nA thread is a path of execution within a process.\nSource geeksforgeeks\nJavaScript is a single-threaded programming language which means that only a set of instructions can be executed at a time.

You can find this and other post from my personal blog https://carriagereturn.nl/\nBack in the days, when creating an AWS account was a lot of overhead, common pattern was to have multiple teams sharing a single account. This created a demand to isolate teams from each other by assigning them an IAM policy that would grant access only to their part of the account. While it might have been possible (in theory) to create complex IAM policies to containerize resources by application or team, one fundamental problem did remain. Once you granted a right to create an IAM policy or role, you effectively granted admin level access to everything on the account. IAM has very granular …",

A blog-series in which I create \"byte\"-sized pieces of content aimed at mastering Kubernetes.\nIn this section, we are going to look to take a surface dive into Kubernetes by inspecting its architecture. Whether you are a fan of minimal version of k8s like k3s or robust cloud-specific versions like EKS, AKS, or GKE - the information explained here applies to all of them.\nSo lets start to breakdown this architecture:\n\nKubernetes at its essence is a collection of servers that work together to achieve a single purpose; run your workloads.

You can find this and other post from my personal blog https://carriagereturn.nl/\nBack in the days, when creating an AWS account was a lot of overhead, common pattern was to have multiple teams sharing a single account. This created a demand to isolate teams from each other by assigning them an IAM policy that would grant access only to their part of the account. While it might have been possible (in theory) to create complex IAM policies to containerize resources by application or team, one fundamental problem did remain. Once you granted a right to create an IAM policy or role, you effectively granted admin level access to everything on the account. IAM has very granular …",

It works like there is a big list say 10k items are there. Displaying all those items in once is not possible as it will break the application.

          "description": "Items of the week\n\n\n\n\nTypeScript - const assertion can prevent literal types from being treated as more general types, e.g. const config = {light: \"ON\"} as const; will have light as the literal type \"ON\" instead of string, making it compatible with type {light: \"ON\" | \"OFF\"}. It'll also make light readonly. More explanation can be found on the official documentation page. \n\n\nJWT - it can be signed asymmetrically with a key pair or symmetrically with a shared secret. The latter means all parties involved use one secret for both signing and signature verification, which means any party with the shared secret could have signed the JWS - something to be taken into consideration during implementation.\n\n\nDesign & storytelling - good stories are engaging and help build empathy, adapting them to your audience and backing up the points with data could be helpful in getting buy-in during a design process. NN/g has an article on 6  rules for persuasive storytelling.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Note of the week\n\n\nOn the week 41 of 2021, I found out about a portable game console powered by a microcontroller - PicoSystem, an interesting product considering it is sporting the RP2040 just like a Raspberry Pi Pico.

          "description": "In software engineering, dependency injection is a technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on, called dependencies.\nTypically, the receiving object is called a client and the passed-in ('injected') object is called a service. \nThe code that passes the service to the client is called the injector. Instead of the client specifying which service it will use, the injector tells the client what service to use. The 'injection' refers to the passing of a dependency (a service) into the client that uses it.\nWe can inject the classes into another class’s constructor and then get the object of that class, and through that object, we can access its methods and properties.\nThe Service Container in ExpressWebJs is a Dependency Injection Container and a registry for the appli…",

          "description": "Are \"else\" statements really necessary? When first learning to program we are taught about \"if\" statements and \"else\" statements. If this condition is met do something, else do another thing. It's fundamental to nearly every programming language, but can we ditch the \"else\" statement?\nLike with most things in programming there will be scenarios where using an \"else\" statement is more appropriate than avoiding it, but let's assume that we want to ditch it no matter what scenario arises. How would we do that and why would we want to?\nThe best way to explore this approach is through examples so let's start with a simple one. All of the examples below are written in Typescript:\n// With \"else\"\nconst areEqual = (value1: string, value2: string) => {\n  if (value1 === value2) {\n    return true;\n  }…",
