And you have to do it ever where you need non blocking code in your application or program.\nJavascript ecosystem (like nodejs) provide this out of the box as its syntax. The JS language sytanx provide all this feature where ever needed. Morever as its part of its syntax, the reader of the code immeditetly knows that where code is blocking and where its non-blocking.\nThe blocking part of multithreaded-blocking system makes it less efficient. The thread which is blocked cannot be used for anything else, while its waiting for response.\nWhile a non-blocking single threaded system makes best use of its single thread system.\nAnd hence node.js if used properly can out perform many multi-threaded systems.",

Some of these historic types have served as the base to advanced database technologies, however, new types have been developed to solve new issues and requirements in modern DBMS.

I created a file named lombok.config inside the folder java (/../src/main/java/lombok.config) with this:\nconfig.stopBubbling = true\nlombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true\n\nThe config.stopBubbling informs the Lombok that the folder where the file is the root and the Lombok don't need to search for more parent folders.\nWhile lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation  put in every generated code by Lombok annotation, another one named @lombok.Generated. This annotation informs Jacoco to not collect coverage from those codes.\nDone, problem solved!\nIf you liked this post, please be sure to like and share 😄\nIf you want to know what I'm doing out there or ask any questions, feel free to look for me on social networks like @malaquiasdev.\nTo read more of my posts, go to MalaquiasDEV | Life, the code and everything else.",

          "description": "This blogpost is about doing buffered writes to a linux filesystem, and latency fluctuations that it could show you, especially when performing a lot of writes, and other implications.\nThe first thing to discuss is buffered writes. Any write to a linux local filesystem is done 'buffered', unless explicitly defined it not to, which is done by opening the file with the O_DIRECT flag. So all file interactions from the shell likely are done buffered, and the Postgresql database is also using buffered IO.\nWhat happens when you perform a buffered write is that you don't actually write to the disk, but instead you write to memory. Because currently the latency of most disk IO/writes is still much higher than memory IO latency (~ 25us/modern SSD vs 160ns/memory, although very configuration specifi…",

But as this is only a demo, please don't use a real password there!\nThe application get dormant after some time without use, so the first access can take some extra time.\n\nShopping List is a web application that was created especially for mobile devices.\nYou'll be able to organize the products you want to buy and do your shopping more quickly.\nOnce you create one account, you can create shopping lists and add products to them.\nWhen you're buying products at the market, you can check the products updating your list and switch from one shopping list to other very easily.\nYou can, for instance, create one shopping list for fruits, other for cleaning products and another for grocery. So, in the top menu, you will be able to switch between these shopping lists while you're checking the products you already bought.\n\nApplication\nAPI swagger\nI used Angular Material and Angular Flex-Layout in this project.\nOn the Quarkus project I used Hibernate Panache to control the database and SmallRye JWT to protect the endpoints.\nPerhaps you can find it interesting the Swagger-UI, created automatically by the SmallRye OpenAPI, that has the possibility of doing one Authentication to test the endpoints protected by JWT.\nThanks for reading this article and feel free to talk with me in case you got interested in this project!",

          "description": "Do you think this is a good usage of map in terms on readability / performance?\nLets say I'm making a list of notes but only allow 1 per day, You have a list of your notes:\n[\n{id: 1, date: \"2021-10-12\", content: \"hello world!\"}, \n{id: 2, date: \"2021-10-13\", content: \"hope you have a great day!\"}\n]\n\nWe have a text field and a submit button, on click we call upsertNote() which will update the array if it's the same day or will add a new record i.e:\nusertNote({date: \"2021-10-13\", content: \"how you get through today!\"})\n// output:\n{id: 2, date: \"2021-10-13\", content: \"how you get through today!\"}\n\nusertNote({date: \"2021-10-14\", content: \"Future me!\"})\n// output:\n{id: 3, date: \"2021-10-14\", content: \"future me!\"}\n\nNotice how one updates the existing entry and the other creates a new one. \nNow lets say we want to add to our existing list. We could do a search on the array for the id but what if we used a Map instead? \nIs that better in terms on readability and performace?\ne.g.\nconst toDoList = new Map(originalArray.map((i) => [i.id, i]))\nconst upsertToDoEntry = usertNote({date: \"2021-10-14\", content: \"Future me!\"})\n\ntoDoList.set(upsertToDoEntry.id, upsertToDoEntry)\n\n// In our react if we wanted to map these out we'd have to do something like this:\nArray.from(toDoList , ([id, toDoEntry]) => (\n<span key={id}>{toDoEntry.content}</span>\n)\n\nWould you implement it this way? :)",

          "description": "When a method [on a child class] is marked with override, TypeScript will always make sure that a method with the same name exists in a the base class.\nTypescript Handbook\nThe override keyword has been a long running feature of languages such as Java and C++, and since version 4.3, is now implemented in Typescript! 🎉\nAs the top quote explains, the override keyword will assert that the function it describes is present in the parent class. This will help cut down on typos, and can give you a heads up if you were not aware that a function was changed/removed in the parent class.\nabstract class Animal {\n  public sleep() {\n    // some default logic\n  }\n\n  public eat() {\n    // some default logic\n  }\n}\n\nclass Unicorn extends Animal {\n  public override sleep() {\n    // some new logic\n  }\n\n  // Error! The method `eats` does not\n  // exist in the parent class!\n  public override eats() {\n    // some new logic\n  }\n}\n\nThis is an example of implementing the wrong function due to a typo, and Typescript catching it for you before runtime!\nIf you'd like to make marking overridden methods with override required, you can enable the noImplicitOverride options in your tsconfig.json.\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    // ...\n    \"noImplicitOverride\": true\n  }\n}\n\nNow, Typescript will throw an error if an overridden method does not include the override keyword.\nI hope you learned a bit about the override keyword!

When each service is responsible for its own specific domain and can be deployed independently, it allows for unparalleled flexibility and productivity for backend teams. However, very few decisions are all benefit with no cost - including our decision to choose microservices over a monolithic backend. \nBefore we migrated our backend to GraphQL, one trade-off that we encountered was the additional complexity that it imposed on our client-side networking code - especially when we had to create views that used data from multiple services.\nFor example, our application had a \"appointment list\" view that looked a little something like this:\n\nIn a monolithic architecture, the networking code for this page could be trivial.
