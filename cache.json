          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

Para ser mais especifico, precisamos do NodeJS na versão igual ou superior a 14.15.4 e precisamos também do NPM instalado na versão igual ou superior a 6.0.0.\nVocê pode criar um novo projecto utilizando o npm init ou yarn create. Os dois comandos vão instalar os pacotes do AdonisJS no seu computador.\nNesse caso vamos usar o NPM.\nVamos abrir o terminal e escrever:\nnpm init adonis-ts-app@latest crud-operations\nDepois de executar o comando no terminal você pode escolher entre 3 opções a sua estrutura de projecto.\nweb: estrutura de projecto ideal para a criação de aplicações clássicos renderizados para servidores. Nessa selecção vai ser configurado suporte para sessões e também o template engine do AdonisJS\n\n\napi: estrutura de projecto ideal para criação de um servidor API\n\n\nslim: estrutura de projecto ideal para criar a menor aplicação AdonisJS possível e não instala nenhum pacote adicional, expecto o núcleo do framework.\n\n\n\nPara o nosso projecto vamos selecionar a estrutura API.\nPodes ver mais sobre instalação de um projecto AdonisJS aqui.",

          "description": "If you are using Node.js but don’t like its package manager npm, or want a more secure Javascript runtime environment than Node.js, then Deno is for you. It is a program for running Javascript and Typescript code outside of a browser. It is an attempt to reimagine Node.js with the advances in Javascript since 2009, including Typescript compiler. Like Node.js, Deno is basically a shell around the Google V8 JavaScript engine, although dissimilar to Node.js it includes the TypeScript compiler for its executable image. If you are still confused between Deno and Node.js, then this article is for you. Here we’ll discuss the comparison of Deno and Node.js. But before digging to the comparison let’s see the overview of each one.\nIt executes Typescript and JavaScript to asynchronous desktop servers and apps. Deno is the new implementation which uses modern features of JS language. It is a secure runtime for Typescript and Javascript that uses Google’s V8 and core is built in Rust. Here are some of the advantages of Deno.\nBenefits Of Deno-\nSupports Typescript\nUses a single executable file\nIt has a well designed module system\nBuilt-in dependency inspector\nIt has a code formatter\nIt takes care of security\nNode.js is a server-side javascript environment, based on Google’s JS engine. It is focused on the event-driven HTTP servers. Node.js is an easy-to-built platform which is a scalable and fast network application. It has an event-driven I/O model and non-blocking Node.js which makes it highly efficient. Also, it is a great solution for data-intensive and real-time apps that can run on distributed devices.       \nKnow the amazing new features of Node.js 16 at- What’s New In Node.js 16?           \nBenefits Of Node.js-\nHighly extensible\nOffers easy scalability\nCan catch single modules\n1.

It uses cryptographic techniques to make sure all communication to and from the server happens in an encrypted way.\nIt gives you a method of authenticating remote users, transferring inputs from the client to the host and relay information back to the client.\nLinux and macOS users can use the terminal to SSH into their remote server directly. Windows users have to use something like Putty.\nYou're able to use shell commands in the same way you would if you were physically using the remote computer.\nThe SSH command has three pieces;\nssh {user}@{host}\n\nSSH tells the system that you want to open an encrypted connection.\n\n\nUser is for the account you want to access (root === admin for example).\n\n\nHost is th…",

Not to diminish the severity of these types of malware, some of them caused billions of dollars in damage. However, the cost of these early viruses usually came in the form of lost revenue due to downtime while the systems were repaired, along with the hit to a company's reputation and customer confidence. Many also resulted in stolen data, leading to compromised credentials and identity theft. But more and more, attackers are shifting to a different type of malware for their attacks.

          "description": "📕 Learn how to build a realtime chat application with Spring Boot, Auth0 and Ably.\n\n\nWhen developing a service, one of the main hurdles to consider is authentication. For every action, you’ll need to both authorize the user (check they are who they say they are) and then ensure they can only do actions which they have permission to do.\nAuth0, an authentication and authorization platform, simplifies this process immensely. Not only does it allow for easy integration with your own login systems, it makes integrating other login services such as Google and Twitter simple. It allows for a simple setup of permissions, roles with set permissions attached, and for these roles to be assigned to users. These users can then make use of various login systems to access the same account and thus have the same permissions associated with them.\nWith Spring Boot, this is extremely powerful, partially due to the strong integration of Auth0 with it. A simple redirect to an Auth0 login page will return a token which a Spring Boot server can use to verify the user and access their associated permissions.\nThis token can then be used to correctly generate access to other services. For example, Ably, a real-time communications solution, makes use of tokens to authenticate with an Ably App. Once a user has authenticated with Auth0 and has an Auth0 token, they can use this to request a token from a Spring Boot server to authenticate directly with Ably, with the appropriate permissions and access granted.\nIn this tutorial, we’ll be going through the basics of setting up an interoperating system as described above. The actual service we’ll be providing is a chat application, which will:\nAllow users to sign in using a Google account\nSigned in users will be able to publish messages to a group chat\nNon-signed in users will be able to subscribe and read messages published\nUsers will be able to see who is online in the chat\nUsers will, when joining, be able to load the last 20 messages of conversation they’ve missed\nRead more...",

The quickest and easiest solution that I've found is to change the password manually in the database.\n\nWordPress stores passwords in the wp_users table. The prefix may be different if you have elected to change that in the wp-config.php file. It's good practice to do that for security.\nWhen you look at the table, it'll look a little like this…\n\n\n\nID\nuser_login\nuser_pass\n\n\n\n\n1\nthomasxbanks\n$P$BHpcLw/aWsTPmeDprzXwOEl45bJm9A3\n\n\n\nWordPress stores your password as an MD5 hashed string. This prevents anyone with access to the database seeing confidential information in plain text.\nIf this wasn't obfuscated like this, we'd be able to copy our password and paste it into the login form…but we can't - and for good reason!\nSo, to fix our little problem, we need to replace the existing hashed password with a new hashed password - we can't overwrite the MD5 hash with plain text because that won't work.\nI have Hasher installed as a plugin in VS Code. If you don't use VS Code or don't want to use this extension, MD5 Hash Generator Online works pretty well.\nI would recommend that you don't create your \"forever password\" using these hash generators though. Overwrite the existing password with something easy to remember and very, very temporary - a favourite of mine is Pa55word! —\n267057150e34eca5c6af39ec9b30864e\n\nOnce the password has been changed, you can log in with your new password and immediately change it to something more secure.\nI hope this helps you as much as it has helped me. 😎",

It is considered public because it can be accessed and changed outside of bird's definition.\n\n\n\n\nbird.name = \"Duffy\";\n\nTherefore, any part of your code can easily change the name of bird to any value. Think about things like passwords and bank accounts being easily changeable by any part of your codebase. That could cause a lot of issues.\n\n\nThe simplest way to make this public property private is by creating a variable within the constructor function. This changes the scope of that variable to be within the constructor function versus available globally. This way, the variable can only be accessed and changed by methods also within the constructor function.\n\n\n\n\nfunction Bird() {\n  let weight = 15;\n\n  this.getWeight = function() {\n    return weight;\n  }\n}\nlet ducky = new Bird();\nconsole.log(ducky.getWeight()); // will display 15\n\nHere getWeight is a privileged method, because it has access to the private variable weight. This is possible because weight is declared in the same context as getWeight. In JavaScript, a function always has access to the context in which it was created. This is called closure.",

After fixing the bug you observe that you fixed the bug on a different branch. Now you want to move a certain number of commits from a branch A to branch B.\nTo move a small number of commits from A to B, use the git cherry-pick command\nSay, you have the following branches\nP ----- Q ----- R ------ S\nF ----- G ----- H\n(Note: P, Q, R, S, F, G, H are all commit hashes/ids)\nand you want to move commits Q & R to B(in front of H). You can do the following by\ngit checkout branchB\ngit cherry-pick Q\ngit cherry-pick R\n\nThis will result in\nBranch B\nF ----- G ----- H ----- Q ----- R\nBasically, we first checkout to the branch where we want to add the commits, and cherry-pick the commits we want to move, in the order in which they appear in the first branch. Ensuring that the commits being cherry-picked are in sequential order is important or can result in complications.\nLike I said, this method works if the number of commits is small, but to move a large number of commits we can use a better method\ngit checkout <branchname where commits are to be moved>\ngit rebase --onto <SHA of most recent commit in branchB> <SHA of the commit before the commit that is to be moved> <SHA of the last commit that is to be moved>\ngit rebase HEAD <branchname where commits are to be moved>\n\nSo, for the above example - moving Q & R to branch B, the commands would be\ngit checkout branchB\ngit rebase --onto H P R\ngit rebase HEAD branchB\n\nThese two tricks should be enough for moving commits between branches.\nTo read more of such git tips visit my blog - https://pranavjoglekarcodes.web.app/blogs/posts/2021/git_tricks_1/",

We introduced new methodologies and were the first to try promising tools and offer them to our clients. To prevent the quality of work from suffering during our expansion, we decided to develop an internal product development metrics dashboard for controlling the quality of projects.\nIn six months, we developed a Ruby on Rails application called Pulse: a quality management dashboard that displayed all current projects and their statuses on one screen.",

Your mileage may vary.\nI’ll be upgrading a large commercial application that leverages many third-party dependencies and a wide gamut of the Angular framework.\nThe initial step is to upgrade Angular:\nng update @angular/cli@next @angular/core@next\n\nOn first attempt I ran …",

After installing this library..\nGo to your app.module.ts file and add below code\nimport { SetTitleWithBreadcrumbsModule} from 'set-title-with-breadcrumbs';\n    @NgModule({\n        imports : [SetTitleWithBreadcrumbsModule]\n    })\n\nin side your app-routing.module.ts file you have to add new data:{} object with breadcrumbs and title object property.\nconst routes: Routes = [\n  {\n    path: 'home',\n    component: HomeComponent,\n    data: { title: 'Home Page', breadcrums: 'Home' },\n    children: [\n      {\n        path: 'records',\n        component: RecordsComponent,\n        data: { title: 'Find Records Page', breadcrums: 'Find-Records' },\n        children: [\n          {\n            path: 'child',\n            component: ChildComponent,\n            data: { title: 'Child Record Page', breadcrums: 'Child-Record' }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\n\nas you can see above, each router-path has data object with two property - breadcrumbs and title.\nNow inside your app.component.html file you need to add component of library.\n<lib-set-title-with-breadcrumbs></lib-set-title-with-breadcrumbs>\n<router-outlet></router-outlet>\n\n\nConnect with me by email : grdtechlab@gmail.com \nWorking demo in this stackblitz link",

It's way better than failing at some random point in your function with a usually pretty obscure error message. But writing guard statements over and over again can bloat code pretty fast.\nYou could, of course, write a helper function for this, like the one below, which is already better.\nconst assertPresent = (value, name) => {\n  if (value == null) throw new Error(`${name} is a required argument`);\n};\n\nYou can then assert the presence of a parameter on the first lines of your function like this:\nconst myFunction = (argument) => {\n  assertPresent(argument, 'argument');\n  // fur…",
