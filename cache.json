Understanding whether to include them as dependencies, devDependencies, or peerDependencies can sometimes be a struggle for newer developers.\nIn this article we'll look at the three types of dependencies found in the package.json file and what each does.\ndependencies are packages used in your app's production bundle.

It also makes authentication process a lot easier both for the developer and the user. For example, you might have seen \"Login with Google\" button on some websites. When you click that button, a request is made to Google's servers and the user's data (without password) is returned to the client side. This response can also be used against our own API to authenticate the user.\n\nWe are gonna be creating a React App which will use Google OAuth to authenticate the user.

Confidentiality(C)\n2. Integrity(I)\n3. Availability(A)\n\n\nNow, what do they mean?\nConfidentiality: Only those with authorized access will be able to access the information. Example: Encryption\n\nIntegrity: The assurance that the information/data haven't suffered any unauthorized modification. Example: Hashing\n\nAvailability: Data always been accessible for authorized users when required. Example: Backups, clustered machines\n\nNon-repudiation: Senders of a message can't deny having sent a message and the receivers can't deny having received it. Example: Digital Signatures\n\nAuthenticity: Guarantee of something being genuine. Example: Digital certificates,bio-metrics\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Why Information Security attacks happen?\n\n\n\nAttacks occur for a variety of reasons like attackers wanting to steal sensitive information, data disclosure, ransomware and many others. \nIt's important to understand the threats that a system may face to implement required preventive measures. \nYou can start learning and understanding the different hacking phases:\n1.

Most of us use AWS for hosting. When building apps, we might have different environments for development, staging, UAT, and production.\nSo if our app uses a web machine and a worker, then we have these same machines in all environments. For example, if we use a development and production environment, we will have 4 instances. But when compared to production instances, Our development environment will have low-end instances. But the low-end instance also adds cost to our billing.\nWe can reduce the development instance cost up to 60%. We can save this cost and use it in any other way.

          "description": "The OpenSSH 8.8 is now in the stable channel of Arch Linux and could reach other distributions any time soon.\nIn the release 8.7, the OpenSSH team announced that the ssh-rsa signature scheme will be disabled by default in the next version: 8.8.\nThe ssh-rsa signature scheme uses SHA-1 and it's sensible to chosen-prefix attacks.\nThis should not be a problem unless you are connecting to a server using the weak ssh-rsa public key algorithm for host authentication.\n💡 If you're using the version 8.7 or a previous one, you can test your remote hosts like a GitLab or a cloud server using:\nssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=-ssh-rsa user@host\n\nIf the connection fails, that means that the signature algorithm is not compatible with the default configuration of OpenSSH 8.8.\nIf you can't upgrade the signature algorithm on your remote servers but you still need to use them, you can use the following command:\nssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa user@host\n\nRight now, Bitbucket uses this weak signature algorithm, I guess you need to use your Git repositories hosted there. 🥺 You can check your connection with the following command:\nssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa git@bitbucket.org\n\nHow can we enable this flag for all the Git commands? An easy solution is coming... You can create an SSH configuration file with the following content:\nHost bitbucket.org\n     HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa\n     IdentitiesOnly yes\n\nThe default location of this file is under ~/.ssh/config, maybe you already have one. Once you add this configuration value you can use any git command without restrictions.\nI hope this will help you to still SSHing the world 🗺️",

And the logic usually goes like this: 'I see async -> I type await and mark my function async as well -> done!'. I got so used to it, so I started to forget how to create and use my own Promises. \nBut life always finds a way to remind you that old habits die hard, especially if you're talking about browsers APIs.\nSo, if you're like me and need a little reminder on how to make custom Promises, I hope you'll find this post helpful.\nSo here is the problem. We need to create an Image element using a browser's API and set its source to a dataUrl of some picture. At first, I wrote something like this.…",

If we take a broad approach i.e. to cover many types in a single type, we end up handicapping typescript and it becomes less effective. \nThe more specific we are, the more effective typescript can be at catching possible errors. In this article, we are going to look at how we can use discriminative unions to write better and more specific types and help typescript to be more helpful to us.\nLet's take the simplest example I can think of - Shapes. In shapes, we can have Circles, Rectangles, Squares, etc; you get the idea. There is no way you can have a single type alias that can cover all shapes without compromising on something.\nIf we were to define a Shape type alias for just the …",

It depends on update frequency. It depends on scoping.\nIf you know me, you know I have strong preferences on what to do with server state. So lets keep that out of the picture and look at everything that's left:\nBefore hooks, there was only one way of managing client state locally: in class-based components with this.setState.
