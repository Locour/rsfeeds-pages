          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

This is just like .gitignore.\nWhitelist copying like COPY src src and copy build build never cause this problem.\nThe files required by a command are different by step. For example, npm install requires only package.json and package-lock.json. Overwriting them in a later step by COPY . . may cause a consistency problem. In addition, not the builder container but only the runner container requires the files under src in Node.js, Ruby, Python, and so on with builder pattern. \nI suggest to use whitelist copying to avoid some security problems.

          "description": "What Is SSH?\n\n\nSSH or Secure Shell allows people to have remote access to their servers. It uses cryptographic techniques to make sure all communication to and from the server happens in an encrypted way.\nIt gives you a method of authenticating remote users, transferring inputs from the client to the host and relay information back to the client.\nLinux and macOS users can use the terminal to SSH into their remote server directly. Windows users have to use something like Putty.\nYou're able to use shell commands in the same way you would if you were physically using the remote computer.\nThe SSH command has three pieces;\nssh {user}@{host}\n\nSSH tells the system that you want to open an encrypted connection.\n\n\nUser is for the account you want to access (root === admin for example).\n\n\nHost is th…",

It is considered public because it can be accessed and changed outside of bird's definition.\n\n\n\n\nbird.name = \"Duffy\";\n\nTherefore, any part of your code can easily change the name of bird to any value. Think about things like passwords and bank accounts being easily changeable by any part of your codebase. That could cause a lot of issues.\n\n\nThe simplest way to make this public property private is by creating a variable within the constructor function. This changes the scope of that variable to be within the constructor function versus available globally. This way, the variable can only be accessed and changed by methods also within the constructor function.\n\n\n\n\nfunction Bird() {\n  let weight = 15;\n\n  this.getWeight = function() {\n    return weight;\n  }\n}\nlet ducky = new Bird();\nconsole.log(ducky.getWeight()); // will display 15\n\nHere getWeight is a privileged method, because it has access to the private variable weight. This is possible because weight is declared in the same context as getWeight. In JavaScript, a function always has access to the context in which it was created. This is called closure.",

This is a follow-on to show what the current upgrade path looks like using Angular v9.0.0-next.6 pre-beta, which contains optimizations for bundle size and performance as well as some bug fixes that were not present in v8’s preview.\nAs a reminder, Ivy is not ready for production. This is still a compatibility opt-in preview. Use at your own risk. Your mileage may vary.\nI’ll be upgrading a large commercial application that leverages many third-party dependencies and a wide gamut of the Angular framework.\nThe initial step is to upgrade Angular:\nng update @angular/cli@next @angular/core@next\n\nOn first attempt I ran …",

Now it was totally on me, which one should I choose, obviously it was going to affect my audience and performance of website too.\nI was also aware about the SEO part,🥰 obviously how could I forgot that, because that was the entrypoint of my orgaic readers.\nFinally I had these options:\nAngular\nReact (Or NextJS)\nVueJS (Or NuxtJS)\nNow I compared all of these and found something in Angular and React, which does not fits to my requirements.\nAngular Too Hactic🤯\nReact Server Side Rendering was complex to achieve for a production grade application.😩\nNextJS Server Side Rendering was supported, but deployment on personal server was removing some important features.😡\nNow the last one\nVueJS  I explored VueJS and found that there is a awesome framework on the top of Vue, NuxtJS. I explored it more and more and found these keypoints:\nServer Side Rendering Support\nBuilt on Top of VueJS\nLightweight\nCan be deployed to own servers, without any performance loss\nOpen Source\nLot of Options For handling SEO\nAt this point, I had no doubts & no questions. I had decided that I will go with NuxtJS and create this awesome site.\nNow its been 1 month passed, everything is running fine and smoothly with NuxtJS.\nHashcodec.com now. We are planning to launch it on 01st June 2021.\nThanks For Reading This Guys.😇\nDon't forgot to visit our website Hashcodec.com\n\nSuggestions are welcome and appreciated.",
