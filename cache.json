Indeed there are many different types of APIs, and the word API stands for application programming interface, while REST means representational state transfer, and this type of API will be the main focus of this article.

Terdapat banyak cara untuk melakukannya, tergantung dengan apa kita akan melakukanya. Kali ini kita akan mencoba melakukan set node_env ke production atau development dengan menggunakan beberapa cara.\nCara melakukannya cukup mudah, yaitu hanya cukup menggunakan command prompt atau power shall, sebelum memulai aplikasi Node.js kita. Berikut beberapa cara untuk melakukan set node_env pada aplikasi Node.Js kita.\nUntuk yang menggunakan OS Linux atau unix based system lainnya, dapat menggunakan perintah berikut ini:\nexport NODE_ENV=production\n\nApabila kita menggunakan OS Windows kita bisa menggunakan perintah berikut ini:\nSET NODE_ENV=production\n\nApabila kita menggunakan PowerShell kita dapat menggunakan perintah berikut ini:\n$env:NODE_ENV=\"production\"\n\nKita juga bisa melakukan set di setiap running aplikasi kita dengan menggunakan perintah berikut ini, tapi perintah ini hanya akan berlaku untuk aplikasi tertentu yang sedang kita running tidak secara global. Cara ini dapat digunakan untuk melakukan testing pada aplikasi kita:\nNODE_ENV=production node app.js\n\nKebanyakan akan menemui error saat menggunakan perintah di di atas, seperti berikut:\n'NODE_ENV' is not recognized as an internal or external command\n\nUntuk melakukan set node_env dengan perintah di atas, perlu untuk install dependensi berikut win-node-env, dengan cara menuliskan perintah berikut ini:\nnpm install -g win-node-env\n\nCara lain, kita dapat menggunakan package tersendiri untuk melakukan set node_env, yaitu dengan menggunakan package cross-env.\nSaat mengubah NODE_ENV ke dalam mode production, semua devDependencies pada file package.json akan diabaikan semuanya saat melakukan running aplikasi. kita juga dapat menggunakan perintah berikut ini:\nnpm install --production\n\nuntuk dokumentasi lengkap dapat dilihat di sini.",

          "description": "After you've upgraded to Angular v12 from a previous version of Angular, you may notice your ng serve times have increased, along with missing sourcemaps, and longer rebuild times during development. This post helps you set a default configuration to development to get your application serving the same as previously.\nIn Angular version 12, running ng build now defaults to production mode. This is a welcomed change, as there is less chance of accidentally deploying a development build to production, which is a lot slower and bigger, giving the perception that Angular is slow. This also aligns with other web frameworks that build for production out of the box.\nThe way Angular serves the application, it essentially does a build with watch mode. As mentioned before, doing a build is now done by default with production optimizations enabled. This adds more time to the build process.\nThere is a migration to add a \"development\" build configuration.\nTo run this migration, run:\nng update @angular/cli --migrate-only production-by-default\n\nOne caveat is that it only supports migrating first-party Angular builders for development mode, including:\n@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server\n@angular-devkit/build-angular:protractor\nTo fix this manually, you add the development options as defaults, and a defaultConfiguration set to an empty string so it doesn't default to production.\nNow, when running ng serve you will get a development build, which is faster for local development.\nIf you liked this, click the ‚ù§Ô∏è so other people will see it.

I have 2.5 years of experience in this and I can teach a few thing about this !\nFor this course we will focus on v-model directive !\nFirst problematic, how do we manage an input value in <input> ?\nWe could do the next :\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: \"HelloWorld\",\n  data: function () {\n    return {\n      message: '',\n    }\n  },\n  methods: {\n     updateMessage(event) {\n         this.message = event.target.value\n     }\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n<template>\n<div>\n    <input\n        :value=\"message\"\n        @input=\"updateMessage\"\n        >\n</div>\n</template>\n\nWe need to bind value of input to our current data message and handle event from this input in order to update our current data message.\nIt's not really friendly and we have to do this for every  component...\nYou can use the v-model directive to create two-way data bindings on form input, textarea, and select elements. It automatically picks the correct way to update the element based on the input type.\nSo we can replace the code above by\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: \"HelloWorld\",\n  data: function () {\n    return {\n      message: '',\n    }\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n<template>\n<div>\n    <input v-model=\"message\">\n</div>\n</template>\n\nWe can remove the method that update value ! Since v-model will directly update it.\nIt's very useful !",

Due to the support we get with most languages we can pass functions as arguments to to other functions, we can also return a function from another function.
