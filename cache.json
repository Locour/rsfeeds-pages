          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

It does so by generating many inputs to be executed until on of them crashes the target program. In other words the objective is to crash a program, but how can we guide the fuzzer in the right direction? \nAFL added to the objective a notion of code coverage: Any input that reaches an area in the code that was unreachable before is interesting. Even if it did not crash the program we can mutate that input to get even more coverage, we call this feedback. Over the past years coverage had proved to be a great feedback mechanism, but collecting it was not simple if one did not own the source code of the target binary.\nAFL originally used compile time instrumentation to insert assembly instructions at the be…",

          "description": "The Dog constructor from the last post worked well. However, notice that all Dogs that are created with the Dog constructor are automatically named Anakin, are brown in color, and have four legs. What if you want dogs with different values for name and color? It's possible to change the properties of each dog manually but that would be a lot of work:\n\n\n\n\nlet husky = new Dog();\nhusky.name = \"Rex\";\nhusky.color = \"blue\";\n\nSuppose you were writing a program to keep track of hundreds or even thousands of different dogs in an aviary. It would take a lot of time to create all the dogs, then change the properties to different values for every one. To more easily create different Dog objects, you can design your Dog constructor to accept parameters:\n\n\n\n\nfunction Dog(name, color) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.color = color;\n  this.numLegs = 4;\n}\n\nlet terrier = new Dog(\"Ewok\", \"tan\");\n\nThen pass in the values as arguments to define each unique dog into the Dog constructor: let terrier = new Dog(\"Ewok\", \"tan\"); This gives a new instance of Dog with name and color properties set to Ewok and tan, respectively. The numLegs property is still set to 4. The terrier has these properties:\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(terrier.name); // will print out Ewok\nconsole.log(terrier.color); // will print out tan\nconsole.log(terrier.numLegs); // will print out 4\n\nThe constructor is more flexible. It's now possible to define the properties for each Dog at the time it is created, which is one way that JavaScript constructors are so useful. They group objects together based on shared characteristics and behavior and define a blueprint that automates their creation.",

In a short object definition, it isn't a problem, but if an object has many references to its properties there is a greater chance for error.\n\n\nA way to avoid these issues is with the this keyword:\n\n\n\n\nlet dog = {\n  name: \"Anakin\",\n  numLegs: 4,\n  sayName: function() {return \"The name of this dog is \" + this.name + \".\";}\n};\n\ndog.sayLegs();\n\nthis is a deep topic, and the above example is only one way to use it.

Today, I will explain what is WSL 2 and how to install it on Windows.\nBut first what it's first. What is WSL 2? The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications such as bash, ssh, sudo, apt, curl, etc. -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or the extra disk space needed for a dual boot setup.\nWSL 2 is a new version of the Windows Subsystem which primary goals are to increase file system performance, as well as adding full system call compatibility.

It works fine on Raspberry Pi, Odroids and Intel servers.\nThe unixorn/cupsd image is a bit on the large side because I crammed a lot of printer drivers into it, you may want to look for docker images that only support single printer families.\nWe're going to store printers.conf in a directory outside the container so that we don't lose our printer configuration every time we upgrade our container.\nI run the cupsd server on an Odroid HC2 because I have /var/lib/docker on the 2TB drive attached to it. I could have put it on one of the Raspberry Pis in my cluster, but didn't want it spooling print jobs and causing excessive wear on a rPi's microSD card.\nMake a directory to store your printer configuration.

Whether it’s internal state or data fetched from an API, state management is a key element to building software. \nHowever, as an application grows, it becomes harder to track and manage those stateful variables. Updating the state in a predictable and effective manner becomes more difficult and can make it easier for bugs to sneak in. This is especially worse when there are no strict guidelines and code documentation.\nA better alternative to managing state like this are state machines. State machines offer a predictable way to manage state by utilising a well-known mathematical concept called Automata Theory.\nLet’s dive in a little deeper and break down what this means.\nBefore we define state m…",

In my case, I was finally getting the hang of using NGRX for state management on an angular application until I realized that all of the state in the application I was working on was using Services and RXJS 🤯. \nAnd because I very well understood how to use NGRX, it was compelling to see how others had implemented state management without the need for an external library. Needless to say, this was one place I needed to take a step back in order to be reminded that there's always more than one way to tackle a hurdle or issue. \nAs of now, I will have to delay my desire to have the ideal workstation, and learn how to develop in any space I environment as I travel to different places - and much of this will require a certain level of unlearning and establishing habits that help me become a better developer and person.

          "description": "If you're working with NodeJS applications, you probably has process.env.VARIABLE statements all around your code base. The most simple method to configure an application is installing dotenv and creating that lovely .env file on the root folder of your project.\nThis approach, however, has some pitfalls and is error prone. What if you don't set that process.env port? You'll probably have a default value (maybe 3000?), but you will need to run your application to discover such type of thing.\nThat same problem has been solved by typescript for almost anything. When you have the help of static typing, you can discover some errors a lot faster. That said, how can you use Typescript to have a type-safe way to access configurations?\nTake a look at that short snippet:\nexport class EnvironmentService<Environment> {\n\n  public constructor(\n   private readonly variables: Environment\n  ) {\n    // some logic to assign process.env to this.variables\n    // you can use, for instance, \n    this.variables = Joi.attempt<Environment>(process.env))\n  }\n\n  public get<T>(name: keyof Environment) {\n    return <T><unknown>this.variables[name];\n  }\n}\n\nIn a nutshell,\nFirst, you need to define an interface for you environment;\nThen, you do pass it as a type parameter to the EnvironmentService class when instantiating a new object;\nFinally, use something like class-validator, Joi or you library of choice to assert if the process.env object has all required variables and assign its value to the variables attribute;\nAfter those simple steps, you can use the method get to fetch all possible environment variables with the help of typescript to guide your choice - and if you need, you can cast the value to some desired type:\n\nThat's all folks! If you liked that simple content, don't forget to comment and share with someone you might help.

Usually with HTTP, the client makes a request to the server, specifying that they would like some data please, the server responds with that data or an error and then the connection closes.\nSince the client is the one opening the connections and initiating the requests, that leaves no room for the server to push data to the client when the server knows that an update is available.\nThat's where WebSockets kick in.\nLike with any other HTTP request, the b…",
