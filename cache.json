I listed all the necessary tasks to be done and sent the issue. After she accepted and assigned me to the issue, I started to write code right away and created a pull request for the code I wrote. It's actually not a big deal for me at all because her code was pretty clean and understandable. Although she requested a few changes in my code, everything went well and my pull request got merged right after that.\nSame thing happens in my code I guess because we had no trouble understanding each other's code. The process was quite straight forward, she filed an issue -> I accepted it -> she coded it -> I requested some changes as she added some extra lines that were not necessary. However, there was one thing I had to do which is pulling her code into my machine so that I could test it out. While testing her code, I just realized that I had a quite big bug in my code that I didn't know about. However, her issue was just for the new feature about config file, so I decided to create another issue about the bug I mentioned above and resolved it after her code got merged.\nMy issue link\nMy pull request\nHer repo\nHer issue link\nHer pull request\nMy repo\nThank you for reading!",

We've made a series of good first issues that includes both a video tutorial and a checklist, such that you can easily get started building in public.\nThe issues chosen for the series deal with API fixture generation. Currently, our fixtures are all stored within the same file, which is suboptimal due to 1) loading large files on the client (our API reference) is bad for performance and user experience and 2) referencing a single fixture in such a large file requires us to look for a needle in a haystack. \nThe goal is to split each fixture into their own dedicated file making them lightweight and easy to reference.\nThe issues can be found filtering on label api-fixture, or use this link for easy access.\nTo easily get started use the following checklist:\ncheckout docs/api\n\nbranch out to docs/api-[ns]-[endpoint]\n\nif necessary clear dist and run yarn bootstrap\n\ncd integration-tests/docs\n\nyarn && yarn build\nmedusa-dev --scan-once\nOpen __tests__/[ns].js\n\nImport from ../test-input/[ns]/[endpoint]\n\nAdd test to the toTest array\nyarn test --watch __tests__/[ns].js -t [operationId]\nMake changes\nMake sure that snapshots are correctly defined so that tests pass across two runs\nOnly add the fixtures and test changes related to your generated fixtures\nPush and open PR against docs/api\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you can watch this video tutorial \nIf you encounter issues, reach out to the community on Discord or submit them to our Github issue board.",

          "description": "Introducing Messageraft  🎉. A single API that can be used to dispatch email, SMS, and chat-based notifications all from a single interface.\nSince I sold my startup, I have been left with a void that my creative mind was looking for ways to fill.\nOne of the ideas that I kept coming back to prior to selling my startup was a notification gateway as a service. I went ahead and scratched my itch and MessageRaft is the result of that.\nLet's get some things out of the way first.\nA notifications gateway as the name implies is a portal where notifications pass through. In layman terms, it's basically a server that has an API exposed to other services/apps and receives requests.\nAnd you guess it, notification requests. Simply put, it is a single API that can process multiple types of notifications and dispatch accordingly.\nWhile it is still in its infancy, it is fully functional, the core is open-source hence it is free to use and you can get started in under 2 minutes (your internet connection and computer is the only bottleneck on that!!!)\nSo, without further ado, I have built and released a CLI which you can use to get started here\nMessageraft is going to be 100% build in public and its core will always be free. I am looking to see if it picks traction and if it does I plan to create a product around it for people who don't want to host the service themselves plus a magnitude more providers support.\nIn addition, I have recently released a helper tool that makes it even easier and faster to develop and test emails locally from your machine with the help of MessageRaft which I am going to cover in another article so stay tuned for that!\nThis is the first time I am building in public and would appreciate any type of feedback you can provide.

This means that you need to define a set of text styles and use them consistently wherever text appears in your UI.\nBoth major mobile platforms provide default text styles for different situations such as headings, subheadings, paragraphs, captions, or labels. However, these styles don't match across platforms, and it's also likely that your product needs won't fit neatly into these preset categories.

It is awesome, let's see how the guard implemented:\n@Injectable()\nexport class LogoutGuard implements CanActivate {\n  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {\n  }\n\n  canActivate(): UrlTree {\n    this.store.dispatch(logout());\n    return this.router.createUrlTree(['auth', 'login']);\n  }\n}\n\nThat's it!\nThe canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!\nAfter this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.\nThank you for reading 🙏🏽\nHope you liked ☕",

A single API that can be used to dispatch email, SMS, and chat-based notifications all from a single interface.\nSince I sold my startup, I have been left with a void that my creative mind was looking for ways to fill.\nOne of the ideas that I kept coming back to prior to selling my startup was a notification gateway as a service. I went ahead and scratched my itch and MessageRaft is the result of that.\nLet's get some things out of the way first.\nA notifications gateway as the name implies is a portal where notifications pass through. In layman terms, it's basically a server that has an API exposed to other services/apps and receives requests.\nAnd you guess it, notification requests. Simply put, it is a single API that can process multiple types of notifications and dispatch accordingly.\nWhile it is still in its infancy, it is fully functional, the core is open-source hence it is free to use and you can get started in under 2 minutes (your internet connection and computer is the only bottleneck on that!!!)\nSo, without further ado, I have built and released a CLI which you can use to get started here\nMessageraft is going to be 100% build in public and its core will always be free. I am looking to see if it picks traction and if it does I plan to create a product around it for people who don't want to host the service themselves plus a magnitude more providers support.\nIn addition, I have recently released a helper tool that makes it even easier and faster to develop and test emails locally from your machine with the help of MessageRaft which I am going to cover in another article so stay tuned for that!\nThis is the first time I am building in public and would appreciate any type of feedback you can provide.

          "description": "Introduction\n\n\nLately, I'm learning React and its frameworks (like Next.js) and libraries. I even remake my personal site as my first portfolio in React. Just made it using Next.js and Chakra UI and integrated it to my Notion workspace.\nTo connect my web to my Notion workspace I used React Notion from Splitbee. You can check it for a while.\nSo, React Notion use Notion API Worker to handle its requests. It can be also self-hosted using Cloudflare. Cloudflare offers a generous free plan with up to 100,000 request per day.\nI will not explain about React Notion details, you can check it alone by yourself. I'll write about how to self-host the Notion API Worker using Cloudflare.\nYou can login to Cloudlfare worker site or register if you don't have an account yet.\nBefore go further, you can fork and clone the Notion API Worker.\nAfter you cloned it, install the dependencies using yarn.\nRename the file named wrangler.example.toml to wrangler.toml.\nEdit wrangler.toml according to your preferences. Here's also example of mine.\n\n\n\n\nname = [Your worker url]\nwebpack_config = \"webpack.config.js\"\ntype = \"webpack\"\nworkers_dev = true\ncompatibility_date = \"2021-10-07\"\n\naccount_id = [Your Cloudflare account ID]\nzone_id = [Your Cloudflare zone_id]\n\nroute = \"[Your domain]/*\"\n\n\nMake sure you have installed wrangler. You can see how to install it here.\nYou can edit the scripts in package.json if you want so you can run it with your custom command.\n\n\n\n\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"webpack\",\n    \"dev\": \"wrangler dev\",\n    \"preview\": \"wrangler preview\",\n    \"deploy\": \"wrangler publish\"\n  },\n\nTo run it locally, you can run yarn dev and open the link.\n\n\nTo see the preview you can run yarn preview.\nThe last thing, you can deploy it to Cloudflare server using yarn deploy or wrangler publish. Then open the link in your browser.\n\n\n\n\nTadaaaaa, it's done. You can check your API worker in your Cloudflare dashboard. This is my first english article, LOL. I hope it can help and inspire you.",

Think about what the console output will be. I recommend taking some time and actually thinking about it!\nconst numbers = [7, 3, 5];\n\nconst sortedNumbers = sortNumbers(numbers);\n\nconsole.log(sortedNumbers);\nconsole.log(numbers)\n\nThe first output is pretty simple. It is [3, 5, 7].  But now listen. The second output is the same! And you might be asking: Why? I defined the array as const how can it be changed?.\nWell, arrays and objects are quite special in JavaScript. If you pass them to a function it will pass the reference to the array or object which means it will mutate the original arr…",

          "description": "by author Kristofer Selbekk \nTypeScript just turned 9 years old, and it’s more popular than it’s ever been. As a matter of fact – it’s close to becoming the de facto standard for most JavaScript projects being started today. But is it still the best choice in 2021?\nIn this article, we’ll look at some of TypeScript’s main benefits, and what alternatives are out there.\nIn order to look at how relevant TypeScript really is, we need to look at the main benefits we get from using it in our codebases. Here are some of the main upsides from going from .js to .ts:\nApplying a type system to your codebase makes you much more confident your code will work. You can specify what kind of arguments are required, and enforce those constraints with near-instant compiler feedback. This makes it much easier …",
