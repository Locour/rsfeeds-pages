It borrows some of its syntax from the fetch API and it is of course type-safe. Let me show you how I'd like to write my endpoints.\n\nHaving an endpoint of about three lines of code is pretty nice to me, specially because there's type-safety involved.

The Index is being created, but while querying using _SEARCH/ QUERY methods, the result set is inappropriate. Like for eg, when I initialise the DB with the S3 bucket and use the PUT method to add documents, where my text is \"Final is the file name\".. and \"what is the version\" . This is how its created ::\ncurrent Indexed one:: { key: 'description:file#0.60', value: [ '1635744247556-1-1' ] }.\nI am able to see the above in my store, when I do a createReadStream. But when my search keyword is \"version\", my expected result should be only the 2nd indexed document. But it gives me both 1st and 2nd.I tried using both _SEARCH/ QUERY methods, but both r giving same wrong/additional results.\nhttps://github.com/fergiemcdowall/search-index/blob/master/test/src/memdown-test.js .\nCan someone guide on the correct approach for implementing other backend store options like AWS-S3 ?",

The more information contained in the log, the more clues to solve problems, so it is useful to post as much information as possible (although there is a limit), or to be able to increase the amount of information through configuration.\nOn the other hand, however, there is some information that is undesirable to output on the server side.\nCredential: Passwords, API tokens, session tokens, and other informa…",

One of the key differences is the use of code to help solve problems within cloud-native systems and infrastructure.\nAny system that requires high availability and/or scalability needs SRE as a dedicated practice.\nSRE can also stand for site reliability engineer, which are the individuals who handle site reliability engineering. SREs perform many tasks and are focused on the production cloud environment…",

          "description": "We often hear SRE and DevOps interchangeably used to describe operational activities done by engineers for applications running in private or public cloud environments. What’s the difference?\nFrom Wikipedia\nDevOps brought a change to this culture that brings the responsibility of building and running software to both dev and ops, with increasing collaboration and shared responsibility across various aspects of software development life cycle (code, build, test, deploy and management)\nThe field of site reliability engineering (SRE) originated at Google with Ben Treynor Sloss, who founded a site reliability team after joining the company in 2003. The Google SRE books have formalized many of the ideas that are developed in these site reliability teams since then.\nUnlike DevOps, SRE is both a job function and a set of principles that are followed by a team to achieve high reliability for software services offered by a company to its customers. SRE also brought engineering principles of writing “infrastructure-as-code”, testing and deploying operational software similar to how product services are developed.\nFor an in-depth explanation of “What’s SRE”, check out our other blog on www.Fylamynt.com\nFylamynt is an SRE platform that helps SREs build and run automation workflows.",

          "description": "I recently needed to stand up a test consul cluster, and I thought it might be useful to share my notes. Here's what you can do to quickly get a consul cluster going...\nFirst, create an IAM role named consul and attach the AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess policy to the role.\nNext, boot three Ubuntu instances, assigning the just-created role to them as the IAM role, and the following user data:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncurl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo apt-add-repository \"deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main\"\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install consul\n\necho \"datacenter = \\\"$(ec2metadata --public-hostname | cut -d. -f2)\\\"\" >> /etc/consul.d/consul.hcl \necho 'server = true' >> /etc/consul.d/consul.hcl\necho 'bootstrap_expect = 3' >> /etc/consul.d/consul.hcl\necho 'retry_join = [\"provider=aws tag_key=Role tag_value=consul\"]' >> /etc/consul.d/consul.hcl\n\nsystemctl start consul\n\nThis will install the latest consul on each of the instances, configure consul to operate in server mode, and bootstrap the cluster.\nYou also want to add the Role tag with the value of consul to the instances. This is how the instances will find each other to form a cluster.\nAfter you boot the instances, edit the security group to allow inbound traffic from the security group (so the instances can connect to each other).\nOnce those steps are done, you can confirm the cluster is working by connecting to any of the instances and running consul members. You should see the three instances listed as servers.\nNow you can use your consul cluster by pointing consul clients at the private IP of any of the instances.",

The greatest thing about it is that it allows you to take advantage of asynchronous rendering in your template without having to worry about subscribing and unsubscribing from Observables.\nimport { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';\nimport { of, Subject } from 'rxjs';\nimport { delay, startWith, takeUntil } from 'rxjs/operators';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'my-app',\n  template: `\n    <h1>Async example</h1> \n    <h2>Items</h2> \n    <ul>\n      <li *ngFor=\"let item of items | async\">{{item}}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>Other Items</h2> \n    <ul>\n      <li *ngFor=\"let other of otherItems\">{{other}}</li>\n    </ul>\n  `,\n  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ]\n})\nexport class AppComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy  {\n\n  items = of([1, 2, 3])\n    .pipe(\n      delay(2000), \n      startWith(['...'])\n    );\n\n  // vs \n\n  otherItems: any[];\n  private destroy$ = new Subject();\n  ngOnInit() {\n    of([1, 2, 3])\n      .pipe(\n        delay(2000),\n        startWith(['...']),\n        takeUntil(this.destroy$)\n      )\n      .subscribe(other  => this.otherItems = other)\n  }\n  ngOnDestroy() {\n    this.destroy$.next();\n    this.destroy$.complete();\n  }\n}\n\n\nCheck it out on Stackblitz.\nAs you can see, in the first example, we are rendering a list (items) using the async pipe in the HTML template. There is no need for the additional handling after the component is destroyed, which you can see is not the case for the other list otherItems.   That is simply because the async pipe is going to take care of that for you.",

In such scenarios most of the time BehaviorSubject is used which acts as a single store to hold updated shared data.\nBehaviorSubject is both observer and type of observable.\nBehaviorSubject always need an initial/default value.\nEvery observer on subscribe gets current value.\nCurrent value is either latest value emitted by source observable using next() method or initial/default value.\nLet’s implement BehaviorSubject to understand a concept better!\nFor e.g In order tracking app, display total items in cart and total items in wish list on UI in header and dashboard section based on user action.\nNow we have three components -\n\nRun Live\nWhen user add items in the cart/wishList, total count needs to be updated in the header and dashboard component.\n1.First create a BehaviorSubject in order service which holds the initial state of order count ,so that it can be used by any component.\n\n\n\n\n3.When a user performs any action, call the next() method of BehaviorSubject. When the next() method gets called it will update current count with new count and notifies updated count to all observers(3 Components) who subscribed to source observable.\n\nThis way BehaviorSubject makes components communication more effective.\nThanks for reading!

          "description": "Hey guys,\nIt was Halloween day, but in this self-restraint mode, it's hard to go out and enjoy dressing up in costumes.\nHalloween has already passed, but you can even enjoy this app!\n\nURL: https://ohmyface.ai/\nThe usage is as shown in the following slide.\n\nFirst, when you visit to https://ohmyface.ai/, you can choose a favorite style from this week's popularity ranking or the overall ranking.\n\nThis ranking is based on the number of styles converted, and is updated daily at 9pm (JTC).\nOnce you have selected a style, all you have to do is just upload the image you want!\nDon't worry, the uploaded images are not retained by the server.\nThe configuration is as follows.\nBackend...python\nIn order to develop the ranking, I created an API to post which style the image was converted in, along with a timestamp, then store the data in dynamo.\nIn order to aggregate the data, I create a Lambda function that returns the style data sorted by the number of conversions, and save the results in another table in dynamo.\nThen, I also created an API to access the dynamo table where the aggregate results are stored and retrieve the data, and call it from the client side to display the ranking order.\nFor the frontend, I used the usual Next.js + TypeScript, but this time I used Chakra UI for the first time.\nHalloween is over, but I think it's an app that can be enjoyed even after Halloween, so I'd be happy if you could play it!\nPlease send me a message if you need.\nyuiko.dev@gmail.com\nhttps://twitter.com/yui_active",

          "description": "A few days ago I posted about a library I made called typed and it never happened to me before that people would actually use something I made. The thing is that I made typed to be a companion library to resty which is a thin wrapper around Node's http core module.\nResty is what I think is the best way I'd like to write RESTful APIs in Node. It borrows some of its syntax from the fetch API and it is of course type-safe. Let me show you how I'd like to write my endpoints.\n\nHaving an endpoint of about three lines of code is pretty nice to me, specially because there's type-safety involved. Take a closer look at request.json and request.query. They both require a typed function to be passed in. If the validation fails, a 400 Bad Request error is returned with a detailed explanation of what we…",
