In that way, GraphQL is \"self-documenting\". Some great tools like Playground and Anvil's own SpectaQL leverage the Introspection Query.\nOverall, the Introspection Query is a great thing, but there is one major downside: everything in your GraphQL schema will be visible to the world. Chances are your schema contains some Types, Fields, Queries, Mutations, etc, that you do not want the world to see or know about.

          "description": "JavaScript is a single threaded language so how does it handle processes that require multi threads?\nLETS FIND OUT\n Why do people say JS isn't a stand alone language? \n\n\nThe first thing that comes to our mind is JS needs an environment to run (node or browser), so we call it dependent language.\nSo basically JS is a single threaded language so how can it perform api or any processes that require another thread? \nIT CAN'T \nBut when its run on browser or node environment, it takes help of something called event loop. \n What is event loop?  \n\nBefore we get into the understanding of event loop. It's ideal to understand how call stack works. (will make another blog on call stack or please refer to another blog on call stack). \nAny process that is async goes into the call stack. It is directly thrown into the event loop and new call stack is formed to call the next process. \nWhat happens in the event loop?\nThe event loop is something that is at core done by c++ and c to do the non-blocking I/O operations that couldn't be done with vanilla JS. \nIt would be easier to understand doing it with an example. \nLet's take the most basic function of asynchronous call which is setTimeout().\nStep 1: \n\nStep 2: Since setTimeout is an async call it gets put in the event loop immediately. \n\nStep 3: Now the call stack looks for the next process while the setTimeout() process is happening in the event loop. This is what they call async programming. Doing multiple tasks at the same time. \nOnce the process in the event loop is done. It goes to the event queue so that the call stack can pick it up once there are no more processes left for the call stack to read. \n\nOnce no more processes are left for the call stack, the event queue then pushes the call backs to the call stack so that the script can finally end.",

Due to this friction, password reuse is a major issue with over two-thirds of end users reusing passwords across sites, creating widespread security vulnerabilities. The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) found that credential vulnerabilities are involved in more than 80% of all data breaches. Since password reuse is so common, a single compromised password can endanger multiple accounts. \nAuth0 was the first IAM system to build support for passwordless authentication, and all of these reasons are as pertinent as ever:\nPasswords are insecure: users pick insecure passwords and reuse them across sites. Since data breaches are common and they frequently include password information, this creates a situation where more and more sites are vulnerable to hacking attempts.\nPasswords are expensive to manage: users forget them, and resetting passwords can be an expensive and time-consuming process.\nPasswords negatively impact customer retention: remembering and typing a password, particularly on a phone keyboard, carries friction, and can cause returning customers to abandon the login flow, therefore impacting retention.\nWe believe that moving away from passwords as an authentication method is key to making the internet safer while reducing friction and positively impacting user acquisition and retention. \nSince our initial release, the authentication industry has been hard at work finding better ways to implement passwordless authentication. For example, the FIDO Alliance successfully led the specification and implementation of WebAuthn.

With its typing layer on top of JavaScript, TypeScript verifies that your program uses the right type as you write code, avoiding potential issues at runtime.\nIn JavaScript, you reassign any type to any variable, or even access attributes that do not exist. Not with TypeScript since TypeScript checks types, ensuring only a value of the correct type to a variable or that attributes from an object actually exist.\nFor example, let‚Äôs take the following code.\nlet foo: number = 42;\nfoo = \"bli\";\n\nThis code assigns a string to a variable that can only contain numbers and, therefore, will raise the following error at compile-time, as shown below.\n\nTypescript error for not using the correct type.\n\nany?\n\n\nThe special type any is used to tell TypeScript ‚Ä¶",

We like Composition API, it really helps you to keep your code clean and composable. The component's api became more predictable. Making components, we also used new features as Teleports, plural v-model and others.\n\nTypes included, you can build your components with clear predictions. (p.s. I couldn't imagine how useful Typescript can be, before I try.)\n\nWe build components with Vite (rollup.js inside), with treeshake and separate css files, so you can use a few components only and take care about your bundle size. (but no so fast).\n\n\n\n\nAdded simple animations for dropdowns \n\n\n\n\nThe library is under development, so if you find a bug feel free to make an issue in our repo Qui-max",

Literal types allow us to define types that are more specific, instead of something that is generalized like string or number. \nLet's say you have a switch; it can have the value of either on or off. One way of defining the types of this, is to use literal types, giving it the type of either On or Off:\ntype Switch = \"On\" | \"Off\"\n\nIn the case above, the value of any variable of type Switch can only be On or Off:\nconst x: Switch = \"On\"\nconst y: Switch = \"Off\"\n\nIf you tried to assign any other va‚Ä¶",
