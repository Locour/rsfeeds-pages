There are multiple other options available to achieve the required result. One of the more popular ones were the usage of a third party API, called Serverless. But, It was particularly challenging for me to find a clean and vanilla solution as I was juggling between different options.\nBelow, I will demonstrate the usage of AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy Angular SSR.     \nOpen AWS Management Console and go to Elastic Beanstalk homepage. Click on Create Application.\n\nNext, Give your application a name, and select Platform and Platform branch as illustrated below.\n\nOn the same page, proceed with uploading the zipped dist folder of your Angular app which gets generated upon building your app in the local system. Now, click on Configure more options button. \n\nOn the next screen, click on the Edit button on the software tile.\n  \nProvide the Node Command considering dist as root. The path used in Node Command generally is of the folder where file to be run is placed.\n\nSave the Configuration and click on Create App subsequently. Environment setup will take a few minutes, after which it will provide the Health status, logs and Deployment URL, as, can be seen below.\n\nHope, This article is useful for the readers.

Gartner defines the Access Management market as: \"The access management (AM) market is defined by customers’ needs to establish, enforce, and manage run-time access controls for internal and external types of identities, as well as machine identities, interacting with cloud, modern standards-based web and legacy web applications\" Auth0 focuses on SaaS-delivered developer-centric and Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) use cases.\nFor more information, please download the full 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management report.\n\nThe Magic Quadrant recognized Okta (Auth0) as a Leader based on our Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision.  \nAuth0 believes that CIAM should do more to balance the three forces of security, privacy and convenience — not just keeping the bad actors out, but also driving customer loyalty and conversion and revenue to create a great experience for our customers, partners, and their end-users.\nWe believe vendors' experience in the space is a key consideration for Gartner in their Magic Quadrant Evaluations. As stated by one of our customers in their review of Auth0, included in the 2021 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer Access Management Report, Auth0 comes with great features out-of-the-box. We went live easily with Auth0 as our Identity Provider.

Despite most organizations' desire to be \"data-driven\", much of the quality storytelling we do remains anecdotal and story driven.\nOn the one hand, quantifying abstract concepts like \"maturity\", \"quality\", or \"maintainability\" is problematic. On the other hand, quantifiable metrics like \"time-to-hello-world\" and \"uptime percentile\" don't describe the health of an API ecosystem or whether improvement efforts are improving the speed and safety of overall API development.\nI joined Postman in April, just as the company was preparing its latest survey. I saw it as an opportunity to build upon existing industry devops insights by testing whether they also apply to API program performance.\nIn the 180th Net #API Notes, I deep dive on the Postman 2021 State of the APIs Report; specifically, what are the four behaviors of high-performing API teams? And how do we measure them? \nMore in the newsletter:\nhttps://tinyletter.com/NetAPINotes/letters/net-api-notes-for-2021-11-04-issue-180-state-of-the-api-report",

As stated by one of our customers in their review of Auth0, included in the 2021 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer Access Management Report, Auth0 comes with great features out-of-the-box.

          "description": "I have many different places where I have to use the same logic, so I have generalized my logic system into a class...\n...\nconst contextLayer = new contextLayerCore(...useState([]));\n...\n\nThis class provides me with a bunch of functions like addContext, removeAll, etc. However, the addContext function is a bit problematic...\n...\naddContext(context: listing) {\n  this.setState([...this.state, context]);\n}\n...\n\nSimple enough; all it does is append an object using the setState function which should re-render any components using the state. Here's the problem, this causes an infinite loop...\n...\nthis.setState([...this.state, context]);\n//                     ^\n// also updates when state updates, hence re-runs the setState function\n...\n\nThis causes and infinite loop. I could using useEffect(..., []) to make it not be dependant, however, this is a function inside a class, thus it breaks React's rules of hooks.\nI have to retain the functionality of this class, so I cannot move the function up into the component(s) as a lot of components use this class and would simply create duplicate code.\nAnd example of where it is used...\n...\n<ContextSuperContainer render={contextLayer.state} />\n...\n\nWhat should I do? Is there an alternative of useEffect? Should I be using a different system for this purpose?",

          "description": "Most people have seen them, those immensely long import paths like the example below:\nimport module from \"../../../../../modules/module.ts\";\n\nTo improve this, you can use import aliases and make it look like the example\nimport module from \"@/modules/module.ts\";\n\nThe benefit of this is readability and that you can move files and folders to sub or parent directories without changing the import paths.\nTools like Vue CLI are supporting this out-of-the-box, but if you want to use the new blazing-fast build tool Vite, you'll need to (at the time of writing)\nFor this to work, all tools need to know that import aliases are used by modifying each tool's configuration file.\nVite has a configuration file called vite.config.ts and by adding the resolve object Vite will know that import aliases are being used:\n// vite.config.ts\nimport { defineConfig } from \"vite\";\nimport path from \"path\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  resolve: {\n    alias: {\n      \"@\": path.resolve(__dirname, \"./src\"),\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nBy adding a paths object to the compilerOptions inside the tsconfig.json like the example below TypeScript will also know that import aliases are being used:\n// tsconfig.json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/*\": [\"./src\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nAt last Jest knows that aliasses are being used by adding the moduleNameMapper to the jest.config.ts configuration file like the code below:\n// jest.config.ts\nmodule.exports = {\n  moduleNameMapper: {\n    \"^@/(.*)$\": \"<rootDir>/src/$1\",\n  },\n};",

          "description": "Before digging into the details, let me first do a very quick introduction to what GraphQL is.\nGraphQL is a query language designed to build client applications by providing an intuitive and flexible syntax and system for describing their data requirements and interactions.\nGraphQL does not mandate a particular programming language or storage system for application services that implement it. Instead, application services take their capabilities and map them to a uniform language, type system, and philosophy that GraphQL encodes.\nThis provides a unified interface friendly to product development and a powerful platform for tool-building.\nspec.graphql.org/October2021\nMy journey with GraphQL started when its adoption was still surrounded by some skepticism; at that time there were not many to…",

It’s a popular principle among back-end frameworks - Laravel heavily reuses parts of Symfony, Symfony by default comes bundled with Doctrine, Nest depends on Express (which even can be replaced with other implementation on demand). Yet, in the front-end field, each of the big frameworks is built fully independently (correct me, if I’ve missed something). \nFor the initial build of Ovee.js, we’ve chosen on-change for handling simple reactivity, and lit-html for templating. We’ve also built an optional module on top of Barba for asynchronous page transitions. This decision helped us to…",
