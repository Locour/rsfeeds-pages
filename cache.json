You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

          "description": "Have you ever wandered what is .map() function in Javascript? Then this tutorial is for you! Today we will look at how .map() works, and what does it do.\n.map()\n\n\nIn Javascript, map function is a method used on arrays, it cycles through every element and executes a callback on each iteration. After finishing iterating through elements, it returns a newly constructed array, that has been constructed according to values returned by callback functions, ran in each iteration.\nmap() method takes in 2 parameters\nCallback Function\nThisArg (Value to use as this, in callback function)\n\n\n\n\narray.map(callback, thisArg);\n\nAs an argument, callback has 3 parameters\nCurrent Element\nCurrent Index\nCurrent Array\n\n\n\narray.map((element, index, array) => {});\n\nIn today's example, we aren't going to be using Current Array and Index, we'll stay on Current Element.\nLet's now look at how it works. Throughout each iteration, our callback function is execute, and returned by this very same function is an element which is pushed into an array that is returned to us at the end. Don't worry, you don't need to store array in anywhere through iterations, it is automatically stored in function memory. Let's now look at examples of the .map()\nEXAMPLE\nconst numberArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\nconst newArray = numberArray.map((x) => x * 2)\n//newArray is [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];\n\nIn the script above, as you can see, it make an array with all of the elements multiplied by 2, and then returns it to us. This is basically the whole functionality for .map().\nThanks for reading this post!

Labels are used to identify a certain loop, and give developer the ability to conitnue or break the loop at will, which would either continue or stop the execution of the loop as you might have realized from the keywords.\nLabel syntax is fairly simple, only things you need to know are 2 keywords, and syntax\nThis, down here is an example of syntax\nlabel:\n  function\n\nNow I will show you how to use continue and break in labels\nlet i = 0;\n\nlabel: \nfor (i = 0; i < 1000000000; i ++) {\n  if (i === 6) {\n    break label;\n  }\n  console.log(i)\n}\n\n…",

So If your API data is not frequently changing then we can cache the previous API result data and on the next requests re-send the cached data from Redis\nAs you know some websites which show live score of matches like cricket match updates the data on the website after every fixed second.

          "description": "Have you ever wandered what is .reduce() function in Javascript? Then this tutorial is for you! Today we will look at how .reduce() works, and what does it do.\n.reduce()\n\n\nIn Javascript, reduce() method is used on arrays, it cycles through every element of an array, and for each it executes a function that you have provided in the method.\n.reduce() has 2 parameters, which are:\n1. Callback Function\n2. Initial Accumulator Value\n\n\n\n\narray.reduce(callbackFunction, initialValue)\n\nCallback method has 4 parameters, which are:\n1. Accumulator\n2. Current Element\n3. Index of Current Element\n4. Array Method is Used on\n\n\n\n\narray.reduce(() => {accunulator, currentElement, index, array} => {})\n\nIn todays example, we will not be using last 2 parameters, we will keep it to just Accumulator (we'll call it a) and Current Element (we'll call it b).\nThroughout each iteration, returned value from callback function is added to the accumulator, which is stored until the end of the iteration and then returned as a single value.\nEXAMPLE\nconst array = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n\nconsole.log(array.reduce((a, b) => a + b))\n// 1 + 2 + 3 + 4\n//Logs out \"10\"\n\nconsole.log(array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 10))\n// 10 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4\n//Logs out \"20\"\n\nAs you can see above, we reduced an array by adding all of the values up into one, single number. If initial values is not provided, then array will take first element's value, and start iteration from the index of 1. If array is empty, then it will throw a TypeError stating Reduce of empty array with no initial value. Although if array only has only one element, then it will return an element, without calling the callback function.\nThanks for reading this post, if you found it helpful then feel free to leave a reaction and or follow for more posts like this, or tutorials on how to make different small things.",

This is made possible by Kernel Namespaces and Cgroups. This decoupling allows applications to run consistently anywhere isolated from the rest of the applications. Containers run images, which contain everything required to run: application code, runtime environment, dependencies, scripts, etc. Containers run layers of stacked images (eg. a base linux image (mostly alpine due to its compact size), node image and application image on top). \nNote that docker containers do not run in their …",

          "description": "Data binding is the automatic synchronization of data between model and view. In Angular, we have 3 fundamental ways to make to-and-fro binding between view and source.\nSource to View (one-way)\nView to Source (one-way)\nView to Source to View (two-way)\nThis refers to as Property binding method, it includes all following patterns to share data from source to view.\nInterpolation refers to embedding expressions into markup text. By default Angular interpolation uses {{ and }} to encapsulates the expression.\n<p>{{title}}</p>\n<div><img src=\"{{itemImageUrl}}\"></div>\n\nThe [] brackets cause Angular to consider right-hand side value as dynamic, without brackets Angular evaluates the right-hand value as static string.\n<img [src]=\"itemImageUrl\">\n<app-item-detail childItem=\"parentItem\"></app-item-detail> \n\n\nApart from element properties, we have element attributes ARIA and SVG for which we can use attribute bindings:\n<button [attr.aria-label]=\"actionName\">{{actionName}} with Aria</button>\n\nSingle class binding\n[class.sale]=\"onSale\"\n\nMultiple Class bindings\n[class]=\"'my-class-1 my-class-2 my-class-3'\"\n\nSingle style binding\n<nav [style.background-color]=\"expression\"></nav>\n\nMultiple styles binding\n<nav [style]=\"stylesExpression\"></nav>\n\nMore specifically, we call this Custom Event binding, utilizing Angular Event Emitter. \nConsider the following code showing button which alerts on click. The alert content is passed through <app-button> component template using custom event showMessage():\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  3. View to Source to View (two-way)\n\n\nAngular two-way data binding is the combination of square brackets [] and parentheses (). [()] refers to property binding followed by event binding.\n<app-sizer [(size)]=\"fontSize\"></app-sizer>\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, which methods you have already used or would love to use soon, or something else?

My dream was born at that moment!\nCurrently, when it comes to all existing frontend frameworks, those widely popular or not, I prefer React since it has a beautiful integration with the typescript. Using JSX as part of a language is really convenient. It offers a lightweight version with perfect compatibility (4 kB Preact instead of 30), with the possibility to inject it on the Webpack level without changes to your codebase.

Lately, I've been playing around with React and Svelte. To be fair, I am liking Svelte a lot for a small single-page website.

          "description": "Data binding is the automatic synchronization of data between model and view. In Angular, we have 3 fundamental ways to make to-and-fro binding between view and source.\nSource to View (one-way)\nView to Source (one-way)\nView to Source to View (two-way)\nThis refers to as Property binding method, it includes all following patterns to share data from source to view.\nInterpolation refers to embedding expressions into markup text. By default Angular interpolation uses {{ and }} to encapsulates the expression.\n<p>{{title}}</p>\n<div><img src=\"{{itemImageUrl}}\"></div>\n\nThe [] brackets cause Angular to consider right-hand side value as dynamic, without brackets Angular evaluates the right-hand value as static string.\n<img [src]=\"itemImageUrl\">\n<app-item-detail childItem=\"parentItem\"></app-item-detail> \n\n\nApart from element properties, we have element attributes ARIA and SVG for which we can use attribute bindings:\n<button [attr.aria-label]=\"actionName\">{{actionName}} with Aria</button>\n\nSingle class binding\n[class.sale]=\"onSale\"\n\nMultiple Class bindings\n[class]=\"'my-class-1 my-class-2 my-class-3'\"\n\nSingle style binding\n<nav [style.background-color]=\"expression\"></nav>\n\nMultiple styles binding\n<nav [style]=\"stylesExpression\"></nav>\n\nMore specifically, we call this Custom Event binding, utilizing Angular Event Emitter. \nConsider the following code showing button which alerts on click. The alert content is passed through <app-button> component template using custom event showMessage():\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  3. View to Source to View (two-way)\n\n\nAngular two-way data binding is the combination of square brackets [] and parentheses (). [()] refers to property binding followed by event binding.\n<app-sizer [(size)]=\"fontSize\"></app-sizer>\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, which methods you have already used or would love to use soon, or something else?
