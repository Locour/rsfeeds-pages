          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalistic routing and middleware web framework for node. An Express app is literally a series of middleware function calls. However, before diving into Morgan, first we need to understand what are middleware functions.\nAn Express app is literally a series of middleware function calls.\nMiddleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle (commonly denoted by a variable named next()).\nLet's take a look at these three function arguments:\nRequest object (req): represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request qu…",

Thinking about it, your project build will consist of plain ol' JS, HTML and CSS files(and images). All you have to do is spin up a server to serve those files. \nnpm run build\n\nor whatever command you have set in your package.json file. This should spit out a dist folder containing your files in the root directory of your project.\nNow, spinning up a server might seem like a lot of work, but with Express( a Node.js framework), it's relatively easy. First, we have to install the Express package.\nnpm install express\n\nThen create an app.js file and add the following lines of code.\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, \"dist\")));\n\napp.use((req, res) => {\n  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, \"dist\", \"index.html\"));\n});\n\napp.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, () => {\n  console.log(\"Server Started\");\n});\n\nThe code above sets up the server and sends your files whenever a request is made to the server.\nTo deploy to Glitch, simply log in, create a new project and import your code from Github. Glitch would handle the rest from there on out. However, if you want to watch how it progresses, you can click Tools > Logs.\nRepo Link(Vue Project):  Here \nYou can reach out to me on Twitter\nThank You.",

Mas antes de entender o Mtls, você tem que entender o TLS, ele é a \"segurança da camada de transporte\", após isso fica mais fácil de entender o que é o MTLS.\n\nO TLS é um padrão que segue o RFC 2246, na verdade com a mudança das versões ele mudou de RFC, mas a RFC 8446 é a mais recente. \nUma observação, quem publica todos os RFCs, seja do jwt, jwe, TLS, e afins, é a IETF | Internet Engineering Task Force (https://www.ietf.org/). Mas voltando... \nO TLS, ele usa criptográfia simétrica, em palavras simplórias, a criptográfia simétrica, são ambos os lados compartilhando o mesmo segredo, e iso torna ela menos segura, se for compara a criptografia chave pública/privada. Porém, você ganha mais velocidade ao usar o modo simétrico, sabemos que existe esse grande impace VELOCIDADE x SEGURANÇA.\n Por que não se utiliza chave assimétrica durante toda a comunicação?\nEste tipo de criptografia é muito custoso em termos computacionais, devido à quantidade de operações que são realizadas.\nAlgoritmos mais famosos usados no TLS\n\nBenchmarks dos Algoritmos:\n\nE o intuito do TLS, é substituir o SSL, já que  ele se tornou mais eficaz no quesito proteção de acesso a sites.\nBenchmarks com o TLS ativado e TLS desativado \n\nO TLS possui três subprotocolos que permitem às partes chegarem a um acordo sobre os parâmetros de segurança que serão utilizados na camada de registro para autenticação, comunicação e para reportar condições de erro entre as partes.\nO sistema é tão forte quanto mais forte for o mais fraco algoritmo de troca de chaves e autenticação suportado pelo TLS, e somente algoritmos de criptografia dignos de confiança dever ser usados. Chaves curtas só devem ser usadas se o valor do dado vale menos que o esforço necessário para decriptá-lo.",

Messing about with JSON files wasn't my idea of fun, so when I first saw Bicep I was keen to give it a go.\nI'm also planning to do more content with Azure Data Factory, so I'd thought it be good to make a video combining the two.\nIf you have any questions about the video, feel free to comment here or on YouTube.",

On the other hand, it has several powerful features that allow you to work around these problems. In other languages, you learn language features. In JavaScript, you often learn patterns instead.

On top of that, they are a great way to ship best practices.\nSo, how do we write our schematics now? Unfortunately, it is not yet as easy as you might think. You can create a blank schematics project like this:\nnpm install -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli\nschematics blank hello-world\n\nThe schematics-cli creates a pre-configured project for you with a ready-to-use ng generate schematic.

Yes, at the moment, I am a nomad who decided I would travel to different cities before I settle down somewhere later in the summer. \nI recently had that feeling of having worked placed so much effort in learning something and finally have the opportunity to use this newly acquired skill. In my case, I was finally getting the hang of using NGRX for state management on an angular application until I realized that all of the state in the application I was working on was using Services and RXJS 🤯. \nAnd because I very well understood how to use NGRX, it was compelling to see how others had implemented state management without the need for an external library. Needless to say, this was one place I needed to take a step back in order to be reminded that there's always more than one way to tackle a hurdle or issue. \nAs of now, I will have to delay my desire to have the ideal workstation, and learn how to develop in any space I environment as I travel to different places - and much of this will require a certain level of unlearning and establishing habits that help me become a better developer and person.

          "description": "Have you ever written code like this?\nconst result = a || b;\n\nIt works pretty well until it doesn't.\nUsing the logical OR to get a value or a fallback works 90% of the time you use it. But the other 10% are actually when you hit falsy values, which might otherwise be perfectly valid.\nOne point you can usually see such code at is the beginning of functions that don't use default parameters, like seen here:\nconst myFunction = (parameter) => {\n  const cleanedParameter = parameter || 'a default value';\n// ... more code ...\n}\n\nIf you call it like this:\nmyFunction();\n\nor like this:\nmyFunction(null);\n\nit works perfectly fine.\nBut what if the following call was actually a valid one?\nmyFunction('');\n\nWell, the empty string is a falsy value and will thus be replaced with the default value. And this is where you hit the 10% where the logical OR doesn't help you anymore.\nThe nullish coalescing operator works nearly identical to the logical OR, but it only reacts to null and undefined. Instead of two pipes, you place two question marks, and it looks like below:\nconst result = a ?? b;\n\nIf you now replace the logical OR in your function with the nullish coalescing operator like this:\nconst myFunction = (parameter) => {\n  const cleanedParameter = parameter ?? 'a default value';\n// ... more code ...\n}\n\nmaking the same call with the empty string as before:\nmyFunction('');\n\nwill lead to the empty string being treated as a valid value again.\nNo matter what falsy value you pass from now on, be it the empty string, the number 0, or else, only null and undefined will be treated.\nIf you like visual content more, or if you want to store it for later, I put all this into one single image for you. I hope you like it!\n\nIf you would love to read even more content like this, feel free to visit me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\nI'd love to count you as my ever-growing group of awesome friends!",
