Today, I found a new resource which lets you create serverless functions for absolutely free! Vercel. So, lets build & deploy our first Serverless function on it!\nThe platform requires us to install its CLI in order to develop & deploy our functions. Lets do npm i -g vercel to install the CLI globally. After creating a new directory, we'll initialize it as a new node project.\n\nVercel cli expects us to put all of our .js files in a folder called /api.\n.js files will contain 1 default exported function which represents a REST API endpoint taking 2 parameters request & response representing the express's Request & Response objects respectively (just like in normal express.js GET/POST endpoints).\n/api/{name-of-file}\nSo I have created a basic node.js project with following files:\n\n\n\n\"But how I will create functions without even testing them?\"\nThe vercel cli which we just just installed globally provides a functionality to run the functions on our own local machines.\nYou will be required by the CLI to login/signup into a vercel account, join me from here after completing that ;)\nvercel dev. For the first time running the cli, it requires us to do some quick configs & settings, after completing that you should see something like this:\n\nTo check how the functions are working locally, we have to go to http://localhost:3000/api & to access the endpoint in hello.js, we will go to http://localhost:3000/api/hello\n\n\nEverything looks awesome! lets deploy it on vercel!\nVercel's CLI makes deploying functions as easy as running a command on the terminal, we'll now run vercel on our terminal in the root of the directory.\n\nHERE YOU GO!\n\nYou can check limits for a free plan set by the platform here.",

          "description": "console.log is useful in a lot of situations (although there are usually better ways to debug if that's what you're doing).\nIn the browser console.log works well with objects, you can drill down as much as you need. But in Node.js, when you look at the output of a nested object, you'll often see this:\n$ console.log({a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}})\n\n{ a: { b: { c: [Object] } } }\n\nd: {} was replaced with [Object]. But why?\nIt's because the command line / terminal doesn't have a nice UI for drilling down, so Node attempts to print up to three levels deep. Beyond three levels it just prints [Object].\nThis is controlled by a variable in the node 'util' module, called depth, which defaults to 2. You can set it yourself here:\nrequire('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = 0; // top level only, e.g.:\n// { a: [Object] }\nrequire('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = null; // print everything, e.g.: \n// {\n//  a: { b: { c: { d: {} } } }\n// }\n\nIt's not a great idea to change an underlying variable, as it might come back to bite later. So a cleaner way is to convert the JSON object to a string and log that. We can use node's built in JSON class and the stringify method:\ncomplexObject = {a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}}\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(complexObject, null, 2))\n\n// {\n//   \"a\": {\n//     \"b\": {\n//       \"c\": {\n//         \"d\": {}\n//       }\n//     }\n//   }\n// }\n\nNote that the 3rd parameter of JSON.stringify, Number 2, controls the number of spaces of indentation, and the 2nd parameter can be used to filter or adjust the objects and properties shown.\nNow you can really see what's in those deep Objects.",

We'll look at the changes and how they impact your web application environment.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \nOctober is National Cyber Security Awareness Month. On top of that, OWASP just celebrated its 20th anniversary. To celebrate, we’re going to run through the newly updated OWASP TOP 10 to remind everyone of how you can better protect your applications, your businesses, and your customers from unlawful and damaging cyber attacks. We’ll also be highlighting where the updates were made and why and throw in some tips on how strengthening your identity solution can help mitigate these threats.\nThe new Top 10 is still a working draft, and OWASP is soliciting feedback on errors and corrections.\nThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organization that was set up to help raise awareness around web application security and provides guidance on how to incorporate preventative measures into your applications, infrastructure, and internal processes.  \nThey have several projects, including an insecure JavaScript application used for security training, but the one that we’re focusing on today is the newly updated 2021 edition of their list of the top 10 threats to web app security.  \nUpdated regularly, the OWASP Top 10 lists the main security threats that affect web applications today. Each entry enumerates the threat, shows possible attack vectors, and highlights preventive measures to reduce the risk of such threat. At Auth0, we take steps to mitigate most of the issues outlined below, so when you delegate your authentication needs to us, a lot of this is already taken care of for you.\nLet’s run through the list, looking at the threats and what we could be doing to make sure our own applications are secure and examining some features of the Auth0 platform that help to mitigate or entirely remove such threats.\nFor a high-level overview of the list updates, please refer to this handy chart, provided by OWASP:\n\nRead more...",

However, even when an organization espouses a blameless culture, individuals may hold themselves to impossible standards and blame themselves when things go wrong.

          "description": "If you’ve ever faced such temptation to wrap inner exceptions within some neatly-defined exception type, you’d better off fight the devil. Let exceptions be themselves and freely fly high the call stack. 💸\nTo elaborate on the issue, consider the hypothetical DataProcessor and the general purpose exception type DataProcessingFailure below:\nclass DataProcessingFailure extends Error {\n  constructor(public innerError: Error) {\n    super();\n  }\n}\n\nclass DataProcessor {\n  process() {\n    try {\n      // Some processing\n    } catch (err) {\n      throw new DataProcessingFailure(err)\n    }\n  }\n} \n\nHere, the process() method only raises a DataProcessingFailure exception, if any. Whatever exception occurs (e.g., DivisionByZero) the caller of process() just catches a DataProcessingFailure instance. So, DataProcessingFailure is a wrapper exception.\nThe reason behind advising against wrapper exceptions is the change of behavior that you exert on the downstream system seen by higher level controllers. For instance, you could mask a well-defined exception that itself is an intricate part of the domain model. Another example is when your wrapper could mask network related exceptions, most of which resolve just by retrying, albeit if some caller at higher level of call stack could catch them as they are.\nPutting it all together, you’d logically prefer minimizing footprints/side-effects of various components/implementations on each other, so that you could avoid unwanted couplings/special-treatments.\nAbout Regular Encounters\n\nI’ve decided to record my daily encounters with professional issues on a somewhat regular basis. Not all of them are equally important/unique/intricate, but are indeed practical, real, and of course, textually minimal.",

          "description": "Let’s say that you’re building a mono-repo app. The structure is dividing some services like fronted, backend and docs. This application and the structure can be handled by Lerna — a tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages. What Lerna does (as a part of many features) is the ability to resolve local and global package.json files to use one and correct packages list and representation of dependencies. This means that you can use global packages in all of your services but if you use some package in the frontend app you don’t need to install it for the backend one. And with the Lerna boostrap feature, you can install and manage dependencies for all of your services with one command and process.\nOK, take a look at the repo structure.\n|root\n|--- frontend\n|--- backend\n|--- …",

          "description": "console.log is useful in a lot of situations (although there are usually better ways to debug if that's what you're doing).\nIn the browser console.log works well with objects, you can drill down as much as you need. But in Node.js, when you look at the output of a nested object, you'll often see this:\n$ console.log({a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}})\n\n{ a: { b: { c: [Object] } } }\n\nd: {} was replaced with [Object]. But why?\nIt's because the command line / terminal doesn't have a nice UI for drilling down, so Node attempts to print up to three levels deep. Beyond three levels it just prints [Object].\nThis is controlled by a variable in the node 'util' module, called depth, which defaults to 2. You can set it yourself here:\nrequire('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = 0; // top level only, e.g.:\n// { a: [Object] }\nrequire('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = null; // print everything, e.g.: \n// {\n//  a: { b: { c: { d: {} } } }\n// }\n\nIt's not a great idea to change an underlying variable, as it might come back to bite later. So a cleaner way is to convert the JSON object to a string and log that. We can use node's built in JSON class and the stringify method:\ncomplexObject = {a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}}\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(complexObject, null, 2))\n\n// {\n//   \"a\": {\n//     \"b\": {\n//       \"c\": {\n//         \"d\": {}\n//       }\n//     }\n//   }\n// }\n\nNote that the 3rd parameter of JSON.stringify, Number 2, controls the number of spaces of indentation, and the 2nd parameter can be used to filter or adjust the objects and properties shown.\nNow you can really see what's in those deep Objects.",
