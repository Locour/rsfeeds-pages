Eg. ^10.17.0 || >=12.0.0 and >=8.0.0 now properly calculates.\nThe new @voxpelli/semver-set also fixes an issue with the license of the former module. Since its a full rewrite I could pick a license myself, so it's now under MIT.\nOther news for the installed-check modules includes a swap from the non-standard VError to my pony-cause pony-fill for the now standardised Error Causes\ninstalled-check in general now also has much more tests and have fixes for issues those tests uncovered, making for a much more robust experience going forward.\nAdd it to your project:\nnpm install -d installed-check@latest\n\nThen add it (early) to the tests in your package.json:\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"test\": \"installed-check\"\n}\n\nA more full-featured example can be found in eg. my list-installed project.\nHappy compatibility checking! 🥳",

Here in upcoming lines, there will be a bit of theory background behind it.\nIn case your system is healthy (understand as an official system with applied updates), you are the only physical user logged in. You can check this logged in information with a simple command you will enter into the terminal. But there is a trick in that, will explain in next lines hereunder. Open your Terminal.app you'll find out in Finder in the section Applications and Utilities. For more informations check official Terminal User Guide.\nBy entering uptime command you'll be informed in one line output about the current time, number of days your system is up, number of logged-in users etc.\nuptime\n\nIf you'll enter this very same command into the terminal in capital form as UPTIME, you'll receive a more readable summary of the logged-in sessions by the user.\nUPTIME\n\nThe same output can be given by entering w command into the terminal.\nw\n\nDo remember you will always have a minimum of 2 logged-in users. By default when you open another terminal session it will be counted as another active user logged in.

          "description": "Zip vs Container Approach\n\n\nThere are two ways to use Lambda functions in AWS. One is to provide the deployable artifact in the form of a zip file. You then have a variety of runtimes you can choose from: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html.\nThe other approach is the Lambda container approach. IMO, the container approach to Lambda management has two main advantages over the zip approach. \nRuntime selection\n\n\nWith the zip approach, you have to rely on Amazon supporting the desired runtime. For example, if your code depends on Python3.10, you better hope that Amazon supports that. In a container approach however, the runtime is something you have full control over. Just make sure either your base image supports the runtime or you install the runtime as part of one of your RUN statements.\nBuilding dependencies\n\n\nNon-native packages such as pandas, lxml, etc have to be built in the target environment for the compiled binaries to work. For example, if you build pandas on Mac, then the compiled binaries will work on Mac - not on Amazon Linux 2 which is what Lambda runs on.\nWith containers, you no longer have to worry about building for a target OS, as you're able to encapsulate OS details in an image. Put simply, the image you build locally will just work in Lambda. How easy is that!",

          "description": "For those of us in the tech industry, we may have come across the phrase 'API' several times. It is important to clarify what an API means. An API is the gateway to your application, the interface that users and other services can use to interact with it. Traditionally, building APIs has been a challenging task until recently when web frameworks like FastAPI were introduced. FastAPI is a modern, fast and high-perfomance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. Today, we are going to take a deep dive into how FastAPI works and also learn what Docker is.\nSince I have already outlined what FastAPI is, I shall discuss a few thing about Docker. Docker is an open source containerization platform which enables developers to package applications into co…",

          "description": "It’s not that unusual to need to see/check/verify the binary output of a shell command in HEX format. Clearly, I mean without picking up a HEX editor or something like that. Last time, it happened to me a few days ago when I was to inspect the content of a base64-encoded string. The tool to the rescue is (of course not limited to) xxd. 🏅\nUsing xxd, to get the HEX representation for some binary content you just need to call it with no argument:\necho -n 'Computer says: \"Hello World!\"' | xxd\n\nDepending on the case it could be more insightful to also have the ASCII values column. That’s simply done by calling xxd with -C option:\necho -n 'Computer says: \"Hello World!\"' | xxd -C\n\nWhich results in such a neat output:\n00000000: 436f 6d70 7574 6572 2073 6179 733a 2022 Computer says: \"\n00000010: 4865 6c6c 6f20 576f 726c 6421 22 Hello World!\"\n\nAlso, xxd can do things the other way. For instance, may you need to turn a HEX string into a binary content, just call xxd with -r option, like this:\necho -n \"0x48656c6c6f20576f726c6421\" | xxd -r\n\nWhich would result in:\nHello World!\n\nThere are more xxd options which you can find by checking:\nxxd --help\n\nor\nman xxd\n\nAbout Regular Encounters\n\nI’ve decided to record my daily encounters with professional issues on a somewhat regular basis. Not all of them are equally important/unique/intricate, but are indeed practical, real, and of course, textually minimal.",

          "description": "<button (click)=\"doSomething()\">Do it</button>\nBut how does Angular know how to deal with this (click) thing? \nIt works because of the so called Event Biding. Basically it binds the target event name (click) to a method from the component (doSomething).\nAs explained in this nice article , Angular doesn't have a list of it's own event names, but it actually uses the names of the underlying DOM events.\nSo the event binding part of the <button (click)=\"doSomething()\">Do it</button> snippet is the equivalent of this vanilla snippet:\nelement.addEventListener('click', () => { doSomething() });\n\n\nThis means the if I want to know which events I can bind to in Angular I can search them here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events\nWhat about the $event?\nIf the event is a DOM event, like click, mouseenter, keyup etc then the $event is the event itself.
