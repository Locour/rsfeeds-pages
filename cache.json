Due to this friction, password reuse is a major issue with over two-thirds of end users reusing passwords across sites, creating widespread security vulnerabilities. The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) found that credential vulnerabilities are involved in more than 80% of all data breaches. Since password reuse is so common, a single compromised password can endanger multiple accounts. \nAuth0 was the first IAM system to build support for passwordless authentication, and all of these reasons are as pertinent as ever:\nPasswords are insecure: users pick insecure passwords and reuse them across sites. Since data breaches are common and they frequently include password information, this creates a situation where more and more sites are vulnerable to hacking attempts.\nPasswords are expensive to manage: users forget them, and resetting passwords can be an expensive and time-consuming process.\nPasswords negatively impact customer retention: remembering and typing a password, particularly on a phone keyboard, carries friction, and can cause returning customers to abandon the login flow, therefore impacting retention.\nWe believe that moving away from passwords as an authentication method is key to making the internet safer while reducing friction and positively impacting user acquisition and retention. \nSince our initial release, the authentication industry has been hard at work finding better ways to implement passwordless authentication. For example, the FIDO Alliance successfully led the specification and implementation of WebAuthn. In the last few years, Webauthn has been implemented in all major OS/browsers, with iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 being the latest to join the party in September 2020.  \n\nRead more...",

It returns a new array and does not mutate either of the original arrays. \nHere's an example:\n\n\n\n\n[10, 20, 30].concat([40, 50, 60]);\n\nThe returned array would be [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60].\n\n\nNow let's use the concat method in the nonMutatingConcat function to concatenate attach to the end of begin.

          "description": "The Angular‚Äôs Core contains most of the functionalities you might need in your application, while with React and Vue, you have to find external libraries, maintained by independent contributors. Therefore, when working with React and Vue, you have to be more careful when choosing libraries, being aware that libraries with a poor maintenance might be deprecated in future.\nTo build an app with Angular you have to learn Typescript, which is a superset of JavaScript, while with Vue and React you can use pure JS. Regarding the view, with Angular and Vue you write it with HTML, where in React you have to write JSX, which is a syntax that allows coexistence between HTML and JS. Thus, Angular and Vue are ideal if you want to reuse HTML from a huge codebase.\nVue and React use a Virtual DOM (VDOM), which is a node tree listing content, and elements and their attribute as objects and properties. The browser DOM is not updated directly but instead, they use the VDOM as abstraction layer. On the other hand, Angular is based on the MVC pattern and manipulates the DOM directly. Changes in your application will update it without any middleware.\nAs common, when creating our apps, the components will have their scoped state, and Angular, and Vue works in a way that the data is mutable. User inputs and code can modify the state directly. In React, the state is immutable. To update it, you have to use a specific function that will do it asynchronously.\nAngular and React have a powerful community behind. Angular was created by Google, and React by Facebook. Therefore, both have longer life expectancy. Whereas Vue, is an open source project, created by Evan You. Nevertheless, Vue gained a huge fame, because the creator‚Äôs idea was to take the best of the other two. From Angular, it took similar templates with good syntax, and from React, it got many features, specially the component-based approach. Vue is actively maintained, with almost 300 contributors and supported by many big companies.",

I just never found a reason to use it, being a content creator and Jamstack developer for the past 3 years I have just been using JavaScript without much issue. If I ended up working on a project with typescript I just understood the system coded and moved on. \nWhen I started writing Collabstream, I wrote an early implementation in JavaScript that used about 30 components, and a half dozen hooks with a bunch of API calls that required specific types. I was trying to pass props and data around and at least 30% of the time I was struggling to keep what variable type was supposed to where. I managed to finish the early POC but probably added hours of development time for no reason. I decided the POC worked really well but the code was an absolute mess, it was probably the worst \"production\" code I've written. I am okay with this, POC's sometimes need to be dirty to see if what you originally came up with works and can scale.  One of the two was true, it worked but the scaling in it's current form would make any dev team run off and live in a hut in the woods with no electricity. \nThis is a simple answer, no. It has a time and a place, and I evaluate it on a case by case basis with a few simple questions:\nAm I making a tutorial? \nDoes this need scale?\nIs this a node package?\nI will never make a tutorial in TypeScript unless is a specific tutorial on Typescript as it makes the barrier to entry higher. If it's a node package, it makes sense to be in TypeScript as it provides auto completion of what I am expecting. \nIf you are thinking of learning TypeScript here are a few resources: \nTypeScript Lang\nLearn Typescript basics in 5",
