In a dynamic language with functional constructs like JavaScript, it is harder to detect breakages statically.

          "description": "Migrating to Deno can be hard when you depend on Node modules. Until those Node modules get ported to Deno, you can use these three methods to import Node modules in Deno.\ncompatibility layer\n\n\nThere is a Node compatibility layer in Deno standard library, which allows you to require() anything which is in node_modules.\nimport { createRequire } from 'https://deno.land/std/node/module.ts';\n\nconst require = createRequire(import.meta.url);\n\nconst path = require('path');\nconst cjsModule = require('./my_mod');\nconst leftPad = require('left-pad');\n\nIt was buggy for me as I wasn't able to import every module, and the need to have node_modules is also a downside, which brings me to...\nIf you are lucky, the authors of the library may have the source code using ES6 imports (and doesn't import any node builtins) and you can import the source code directly from the URL (remember, you can import any URLs!)\nFor example, you could import lodash like so:\nimport cloneDeep from 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lodash/lodash/master/cloneDeep.js';\n\nI got that URL by going to the file on GitHub and then clicking the raw button.\nBut sometimes, you also need to support all those node builtins. That brings me to...\nJSPM is a module CDN which allows you to import any node module in the browser, and by extension that means that you can use it to import to deno too! \nJSPM is the most reliable method so far, it is used in my Web Framework Sleek too!\nSo if you want to import the wonderful recast library, you can do this:\nimport recast from 'https://jspm.dev/recast';\n\nAnd that's it, you can now use recast!\nIf you found this post helpful, spread the word! or follow me on twitter or over here to stay updated on my blog posts!",

          "description": "It is not easy to start programming in Python, but it is worth the effort. Some people say that Python is easier to learn than other programming languages because it has less syntactic distinctions.\nYou can compare Python with other programming languages, but the readability of its code makes it easier for beginners to start their journey in coding. It also has a well-documented syntax that makes it easier for learners to understand the language.You can start learning python from Pythonscholar.com they explain each topic with multiple examples.\nPython is one of the most popular programming languages that can be learnt by anyone. It is especially popular for scientific computing and data science due to its simplicity.\nPython was created in 1991 by Guido von Rossum. It has an easy syntax with which you can write up to 100 lines of code without needing to use curly brackets {} at the end of each line.For more dept about python history you guys can refer this artical in what is python.\nThe environment for Python is cross-platform, so if you are working on Linux or Windows, you will find Python coding very similar to what you are used to. The downside is that it takes longer than other languages like C++ or Java, but once you learn it, Python will become your favorite language because it's flexible and able to solve many problems that many other languages cannot.\n—\n\nPython is a very powerful and popular programming language. It is used in websites, games, and even the International Space Station!\nPython is easy to learn for beginners because it has a simple syntax and gets rid of the need for semicolons. Python also doesn't require any import statements when writing programs.",

          "description": "Backstory\n\n\nHave you ever experience difficulties in software development due to unsupported / different version ? Recently I was facing the same issue. The issue was a different Node.js version from my machine (Node v14.18.0) with my company project repository (Node v10 required). The first solution that instantly pop up in my mind was \"I think downgrade my current node by uninstalling it will do the work\", But what if you need another version for another project in the near future? Do you want to endure the pain of installing and uninstalling Node.js every time you need a different version of it ? \n\nNVM is a version manager for Node.js, it allows you to quickly install and use different versions of node via the command line.\nLet's head to the tutorial !\nIf you happen to use UNIX, macOS, or WSL (Window Sub-system for Linux), you can install and read the official documentation here\nIf you happen to use Windows you can install it at NVM for windows which is developed by Corey Butler, download the nvm-setup.zip file.\n \n\nAfter the installation you can open your command prompt and check whether nvm is recognized\nC:\\Users\\YourUsername>nvm -v\n\nRunning version 1.1.8.\n\nIf nvm is not recognized as internal command or external command, try to re-open your command prompt.\nThen, You can type nvm list in order to see list of Node.js version on your machine.\nC:\\Users\\YourUsername>nvm list\n\n  * 14.18.0 (Currently using 64-bit executable)\n    10.18.0\n\nIf you don't see your desired Node.js version in the list, you can use nvm install command, for example if you want Node.js version 8, you can type nvm install 8.0.0\nTo use the installed Node.js version you can simply type nvm use 8.0.0\nIf you see an error message exit status 5: Access is denied., It is due to admin privilege issue. To solve it you can simply run your command prompt as administrator. \nThank you for your time reading this short article / tutorial about Node Version Manager, hope it helps! and Have a great day.",

In simple terms, encryption ensures only those who are meant to understand the information do so, and for others, it is just gibberish.\nEncryption transforms readable plaintext into unreadable ciphertext that only the intended users can understand. This prevents attackers from making sense of the data even if they get access to it. The intended users will be aware of how to convert the ciphertext into plaintext, a process known as decryption.\nA simple encryption example is, say alphabet A -> 1, B -> 2, C -> 3, so on.. So the word CAB would be 321. The receiver will convert the 321 back to plain text by mapping the numbers to alphabets -> CAB.\nEven though the above encr…",

          "description": "Your terminal can do some really cool things. The | operator was a stroke of genius. It lets you take the output of one command and feed it to another, chaining together a few simple tools to perform a bigger automated task.\nShell scripts are a natural extension of your terminal's power. Creating ready-to-run recipes for later use? Sweet. But once you start using these scripts for more advanced things, you run into some unfortunate Bash quirks. For example: when a part of your script produces an error, the rest of the script will still be executed, making its behavior unpredictable.\nThere are some habits that you can adopt right now to make writing shell scripts easier.\n\n\n\n\nHere's the gist of it if you don't need further explanation:\nAdd set -euo pipefail to improve how your script deals with undeclared variables and non-zero exit codes.\nAdd IFS=$'\\n\\t' so that array elements are split in a predictable way.\nWhen defining functions, return data with echo instead of return. The return keyword doesn't do the same thing as in other languages.\nReturning arrays from functions is not really possible. As a bad but easy workaround, you can pass array return values via a global variable.\nKeep your whitespace in mind. Confusingly, if [ FOO=='bar' ] will overwrite the value of $FOO. if [ FOO = 'bar' ] will perform a string equality check.\nAlternatively, for complex tasks, you'll probably have an easier time using a different scripting language like Python, Ruby or Perl.\nUnofficial bash strict mode\nYour bash scripts are rubbish, use another language",

Each of them has its pros and cons, and, of course, preference in choosing a particular library is sometimes subjective. It can cause misunderstanding in a team when you're not agreeing with using styled-components in your project because you'd already worked with one library before, and it's not prominent and easy to switch to see the benefits of a new approach. Here you have a question: \"Why should I use this instead of this?\" and we're going to answer it at first.\nOne of our team members asked this question because he always used CSS Modules and didn't understand why it's useful.

However, since this post would be so short, I though I should add a...\nWhile we're talking about static classes: do you know the best way to make a class unconstructable? This might come in handy for a utility class with only static methods. The most popular method is:\nclass Util {\n  public constructor() {\n    throw new Error('Do not initialize this class!');\n  }\n}\n\nHowever, you can shorten it by just extending null:\nclass Util extends null {}\n\nnew Util(); // TypeError!\n\n💖",
