But most of the time we have to make two or more API calls depending on the requests. That's when problem occurs. Because the more API calls you make, the longer it will need to serve the data.\nLet's assume you have to handle a request which requires five API calls. You make five API calls one by one. When all of the data is available, you clean, format and merge them and send it to the frontend. Let's say it takes six seconds to get data from all of the API calls. Six seconds may seem feasible but it's always better to make things efficient and faster whenever possible. \nSo, to serve the request faster we can make all t‚Ä¶",

And for your security teams, this means a growing variety of endpoints and threats they need to secure in order to protect your organization from a data breach.\nAs in the past, the most common threats to mobile security include mobile malware.

In other words, organizations are more likely to retain employees if they offer flexible work arrangements.\nBut shifting from in-person work to remote work comes with a full host of changes (and something to keep in mind when starting a business). The most crucial one? Making sure your remote team is set up to work safely and securely. \nBut before we touch on 10 tips to improve your remote team‚Äôs security, let‚Äôs take a look at the importance of safe and secure remote working.\nNow that more employees are working remotely, many companies are using cloud based workflows, so everyone has‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Simple is not easy, easy is not simple\nLet's first get that out of the way. People are often equating easiness with simplicity, but they are very different words.\nSimple (vs complex) - from \"sim plex\", literally: one-fold (i.e. not braided)\n\n\nEasy (vs hard) - from \"lying at, lie near\"; familiar, near to our understanding\n\n\n\nRich Hickey goes more into details about this in his presentation. If you haven't already, check it out (I don't agree with everything he said, but it's a good presentation, definitely worth watching).\nMost often, achieving simplicity is the hardest thing to do in software development and usually it requires an enormous experience.\nSimplicity is probably the most important aspect of software development. As Edsger Dijkstra put it, \"Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability\".\nIf your design is not simple, the whole thing will eventually become fragile, unreliable and starting to fall apart.\nUnfortunately, complexity sells much better and when you combine that with cargo-cult programming and resume driven development, you get the modern web development mess.\nThe same goes for modern system administration (or devops, if you will) - if you've been working with UNIX long enough, all you need to do is take a look at Kubernetes mess.\nI created devsimplicity.com as a simple, wiki-like place, focused mostly on addressing those issues, avoiding complexity traps and as a quick way to find&explore the better/saner alternatives. There's still lot of work to do, but it's getting better. If you like the idea, follow me on twitter.com/devsimplicity or here for the updates.\nNote: This is a snapshot of a wiki topic on devsimplicity.com and may be outdated.

          "description": "vim (aka Vi IMproved) is a highly efficient text editor that has inspired other editors like it, most notably MacVim (which I will refer to as vim from here on) and gVim.\nYou see, I use a code editor called Vim, which is sort of like an operating system for writing code.  I know it might seem bizarre, but there's a method to my madness:  Vim lets me write code very quickly and with very little effort. It's a great way of working that I wake up excited to do every day.  \n\nVim is one of the most popular text editors, which is why you‚Äôre either using it or wondering why you should be using it. But if you‚Äôre not a programmer, why should you care?\nIt's a matter of preference, but \nYou don‚Äôt have to open vim to write code\nIf you‚Äôre like us, you don‚Äôt want to have to switch between your text editor and your terminal while you write your code.\nYou can use it over an SSH connection\nThis is a big plus. With a few commands you're inanother computer and can edit right away\nIt works on all operating systems\nEven the most obsecure operating systems support vim. Like some router with busybox installed\nIt's completely controlled by key presses\nYou don't need to use the mouse, vim is controlled by key presses. However if you like clicking around, there's gvim.\nVim does have a steep learning curve, but you can practice vim on sites like vim.is",

          "description": "This article talks about an efficient way to implement auto-complete feature using Angular concepts. The key components used in this demonstration are as follows:\nAngular Material (v12) Autocomplete module.\nRxJS for action and data binding.\nAngular in-memory-web-api for REST services (Refer to in-memory-web-api).\n¬†\n\n¬†\n\n¬†\n\n\n\n\nLet us now see how we go about it:\nThe front-end consists of an angular autocomplete module. The input event taps the user's keystrokes and emits a new value into an action subject.\n\nAutocompleteService class.\n\nThe action BehaviorSubject starts with an empty string. The action$ is an observable built out of this subject.\n\nGET request. Since this is a higher-order observable (i.e., an observable returning an observable), we make use of one of the higher order functions like switchMap.\n\nswitchMap (and not other higher order functions like concatMap or mergeMap)? The reason is: switchMap unsubscribes from the previous observable once a new value is emitted by the parent observable.\nWhat this means is - as soon as the user types in another letter or removes a letter, there is simply no need to subscribe and execute the rest call for the previous values. The user is only interested to see the results of the search according to his/her current input. And switchMap does this automatically, and thus gets rid of unwanted rest calls.\nWe can also get additional control on when to fire the rest service depending on the length of the user's input. For example, in this demo, I fire the rest call only when the user has entered at least 2 characters. If not, then I return an observable of empty array (using of([])).\n¬†\n\n\n  \n  \n  Back to the Component:\n\n\nWe tap onto the above observable and use async pipe to subscribe to it. Since we are completely using observables, we can also use the OnPush change-detection-strategy.\n\n¬†\n@angular/cli - 12.1.0\nGitHub\n¬†\nCheers!",

Now when I view my webpage source on the browser, I get this:\n\nSo does this mean that my SSR is broken?\nNope! My SSR is perfectly fine :-) Let's run a quick check to prove this. Open up POSTMAN and run a GET request against http://localhost:4000. And voila! I see my server-side-rendered page once again!\n\n--\nindex.html is now cached by service-worker at the browser. The browser does not need to wait for the server to render the content any more, and it simply serves the cached version, and Angular takes over thereafter, like a normal SPA. Open up ngsw-config.json and verify that index.html is one of the cached resources.\n\nNote (and a small exercise): If you remove index.html from ngsw-config.json and re-build your universal, you would see that the server-rendered content is back on your browser source, since the HTML is now no longer being cached!\n¬†\nCheers -:)",

With it, you can build efficient native, web, and mobile apps with a wide range of tools and libraries it integrates. However, there are still ways apps built with it can be improved. For example, using Angular Universal, you can render your apps server-side to speed up page loads and improve SEO and performance.\nServer-side rendering involves converting an app to HTML on a server. When you send a request for a particular path to the server, it returns an entirely static HTML page as a response.
