I personally enjoyed using NestJS a lot more than ExpressJS because 1) ExpressJS doesn't provide a structure for your project and 2) NestJS requires less set up.\n1) Structure\nI guess that freedom is good for others but bad for people with little experience. Let's get into the details of how it is different. Let's say that there are two different modules: User and Game. Nest structures this by putting all the User related files into a folder called User. That module would have a controller, service, repository, entity, and other testing files. ExpressJS, based on my personal experience, structures their projects according to its function. For example, all the controllers are grouped together and other routers are grouped together, etc.\nNest Controller == Express Router\n1) Set up\nAlthough learning dependency injection, inversion of control, and other weird crazy words is difficult in the beginning NestJS really helps users focus on the project at hand instead of the set up which is really convenient for me personally.",

          "description": "Today I faced a problem while triggering the delivery pipeline and this article is about the solution to that problem. \nHave you ever faced the need to push a commit to a Git branch without changing any files in order to re-run your integration process? If yes then you are landed at the right place, my friend. 😉\ngit commit --allow-empty -m “Message”\n\nFor continuous integration, we are using  Buddy delivery pipelines which allow us to build, test and deploy applications on a single push to a specific git branch. It helps us to reduce the manual overhead of deploying code to the server and handle all the actions automatically.\nBut today I faced a problem where I needed to re-run my delivery pipeline of a branch without adding any extra space or changing any files in the repository, so I searched for the solution for a while and It turns out that Git is allowing us to push an empty commit without adding any staged files to the branch, by using one option  --allow-empty  during git commit.\nPushing a commit with staged files\ngit add .\n\ngit commit -m \"changes on app controller\"\n\ngit push origin master \n\nThe above commands will add all unstaged files and add commit and push the code to the master branch, after that our delivery pipeline will be started.\nOnce the pipeline process fails or you need to run the process again, you will have to push something to the branch but as I mentioned earlier, we will not make any changes to the files, and even then, We will be able to commit the branch with this command.\nPushing empty commit\ngit commit --allow-empty -m \"rerunning the delivery pipeline\"\n\ngit push origin master \n\nAfter the above commands, you can see that the commit has been pushed to your branch and the delivery pipeline will be started.\nYou learned that you can be able to push an empty commit with the --allow-empty option of git commit. let me know in the comments if there is any other way to do this.",

The pod consists of one or more containers that are connected to each other and share storage yet run independently.

As you can see, it's a bit more fancy than top\n\n'iostat' is a command that is used to monitor input/output devices, by telling you how long the devices have been active.\n\nDisplays the processes\n\nTells you how long the system has been up\n\n'free' shows you the amount of available memory you have.\n\nUsed to monitor individual tasks.

To do that first run\nparu dropbox\n\nNow you'll be prompt with a list of packages from AUR to choose from. You have to choose aur/dropbox which should be the first one... So press 1 and hit enter\n\nIf you want to review hit Y and enter\n\nTo close the review hit q on the the keyboard\nNow you must prompt with installation confirmation. Hit Y and enter.

Facebook updates and creates new guides for this collection on a regular basis.\nAdvantages of ReactJS:\nReactJs has a lot of experience with SEO. While other Javascript does not allow SEO, you can easily run your ReactJS with the servers.\nDisadvantages of ReactJS:\nReact technologies are evolving and developing at such a rapid pace that there is no time to properly document them. To get around this, developers write their own instructions when new versions and tools in their present projects evolve.\nAngularJS:\nAngularJS is a framework for building dynamic web applications. It allows you to utilize HTML as your template language and enhance HTML's syntax to represent the components of your application clearly and succinctly. Data binding and dependency injection in AngularJS eliminate a lot of the code you'd have to write otherwise. And because it all happens in the browser, it's a great companion for any server technology.\nAdvantages of AngularJS:\nBecause Angularjs is an open-source JavaScript MVC framework, anyone can create a custom application at a low cost.\nDisadvantages of AngualrJS:\nIn Angular, there is no server authorization or authentication. Authorization is the process of granting data access authorization and identifying a user by validating credentials. Because AngularJs is unable to fulfill both functionalities, we refer to it as \"less secure.\"\nAngularJs is totally dependent on JavaScript. If these scripts are hidden, the resulting pages appear to be rudimentary.\nIt's huge and complicated. There are numerous ways to execute the same operation in angular, making it impossible to determine which method is the most efficient.\nAngularJs is not supported by Internet Explorer 8.0.",

From there you can make decisions on your data, run it through AI models, or visualize it with powerful dashboards.\nBut what if that's just too much? What if you just want to see the data in Excel?\nThis is a common case - especially in schools that are introducing physical computing to CS students. They often don't have the money, expertise, or firewall access to spin up cloud services to ingest data, and visualization services to show it. What they do often have is Excel - either running on PCs, Macs, Chromebooks or iPads, and usually want to connect a simple device to something, and plot data from it so students can work on projects.\n\nOne example is digital agriculture, wh…",

The requirement was for the library to make an API request to an external service in order to refresh tokens if the provided token had expired. I'm not writing this post to discuss the library itself, but to talk about how I wrote the unit tests for it as I found it a little tricky to implement a solution that catered for sending and receiving dynamic data to and from the external service, whilst keeping the tests isolated.
