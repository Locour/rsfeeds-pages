LinkedIn, in turn, has successfully migrated a part of the code that has been written in Ruby on Rails to Node.js.

This method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. Any calls to setState()here will trigger a re-rendering of your component. When you call an API in this method, and set your state with the data that the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive the data.\n\n\nBelow is a mock API call in componentDidMount(). It sets state after 2.5 seconds to simulate calling a server to retrieve data. This example requests the current total actives users for a site. In the render method, render the value of activeUsers in the h1 after the text Active Users:.\n\n\n\n\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      activeUsers: null\n    };\n  }\n  componentDidMount() {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      this.setState({\n        activeUsers: 1273\n      });\n    }, 2500);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {/* Change code below this line */}\n        <h1>Active Users: </h1>\n        {/* Change code above this line */}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n\n\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      activeUsers: null\n    };\n  }\n  componentDidMount() {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      this.setState({\n        activeUsers: 2324\n      });\n    },1500);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <h1>Active Users: {this.state.activeUsers} </h1>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}",

Here For example, The MyApp component is stateful and renders a Navbar component as a child. We have to pass the nameproperty in its state down to the child component, then show the name in the h1 tag that's part of the Navbar render method. name should appear after the text Hello, my name is:.\n\n\nEx:\n\n\n\n\nclass MyApp extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      name: 'CamperBot'\n    }\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n       <div>\n         {/* Change code below this line */}\n         <Navbar name = {this.state.name}/>\n         {/* Change code above this line */}\n       </div>\n    );\n  }\n};\n\nclass Navbar extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n    <div>\n      {/* Change code below this line */}\n      <h1>Hello, my name is: {this.props.name}</h1>\n      {/* Change code above this line */}\n    </div>\n    );\n  }\n};\n\nAbout React, there's an important pattern to it. The first is unidirectional data flow.\nState flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. \nThe second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. \nLarson, Q., 2019. Frontend Development Libraries. [online] Freecodecamp.org.

As you can see, it's a bit more fancy than top\n\n'iostat' is a command that is used to monitor input/output devices, by telling you how long the devices have been active.\n\nDisplays the processes\n\nTells you how long the system has been up\n\n'free' shows you the amount of available memory you have.\n\nUsed to monitor individual tasks. Great for troubleshooting issues.\n\n'w' tells you information about users logged on and their processes\n\nThese commands can be vital for you to monitor your system, so I will be releasing a part 2 soon, as well!😆\nFor future Linux and security content, please give me a follow \n@linuxseb\n \n\n\n  \n  \n  Thank you again!😊",

It seemed to require extensive and comprehensive knowledge and understanding of commands and keyboard shortcuts. However, as I read more about it and practiced what I learned, I realized that it isn't as scary as it seemed; that It only requires a lot of constant practice. I also discovered that others feel the same way, which made me realise that I wasn't alone.\nThe other thing I discovered during this period is that we are all beginners and sharing is helpful, since no one is an island. So I decided to share my experience with others starting out as well. As we all know, learning is never-ending. There will always be new tools and new commands to learn, especially when you're a beginner. The followin…",

          "description": "TLDR\n\n\nIf you don't care about the context of these tests and want to go straight to the node-fetch mocks, skip to the here's my solution section.\nI wrote a middleware library to be used by micro-services that decodes and verifies JWTs and works with Express and Koa. The requirement was for the library to make an API request to an external service in order to refresh tokens if the provided token had expired. I'm not writing this post to discuss the library itself, but to talk about how I wrote the unit tests for it as I found it a little tricky to implement a solution that catered for sending and receiving dynamic data to and from the external service, whilst keeping the tests isolated. Hopefully this will be helpful to someone trying to do a similar thing.\nThe controller function looks a …",

Is this going to be another Nodejs vs io.js fiasco or npm vs yarn battle.” You might even have thought: “Yet another tool in the JavaScript ecosystem to make our lives miserable.” After all, JavaScript has a history of making developers feel exhausted. Is Deno going to be another reason for developers to dislike JavaScript?\nThe short answer is No. In fact, it’s the exact opposite. You should definitely learn Deno in 2022. If you want to know why, continue to read this article. If you are already convinced, great! Head over to the Deno website and start learning it for 2022.\nFirst off, let’s get this out of the way.

          "description": "Being a coder I have never limited myself to one language, one framework and I didn’t want to have a milion code editors each specialised in different thing so I have always used VSCode. Keeping the theme, the look and feel of the editor with power of an IDE one plugin away no matter which language I want to jump into is the key factor that guided my choice.\nHowever, I have tried JetBrains’ WebStorm before and just couldn’t get rid of one huge thing haunting me, the project-wide type checking.\nIn VSCode the typescript plugin works great but it only checks files that are currently opened in the editor! Other files inside the project are not being checked until opened 😕 Now this is a huge bump, having to run the check manually through console or build the whole app in order to check if one type alternation hasn’t influenced anything else? Madness…\nThis is when I decided to research this problem — and there really is no out of the box solution! After trying every way on the internet I have finally pieced together the final solution for this problem:\n{\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n    \"tasks\": [\n      {\n        \"label\": \"tsc-watch project\",\n        \"type\": \"typescript\",\n        \"tsconfig\": \"tsconfig.json\",\n        \"option\": \"watch\",\n        \"problemMatcher\": [\"$tsc-watch\"],\n        \"group\": \"build\",\n        \"runOptions\": {\n          \"runOn\": \"folderOpen\"\n        },\n        \"presentation\": { \"reveal\": \"never\" }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\nThis is an automated task for VSCode — it runs when the project folder is opened and keeps on running, checking the whole repo real-time based on the changes you make! Finally! 🎉\nPut it in\n\n.vscode/tasks.json\n\n\n\n\nRe-open the project folder and accept the popup asking whether Automatic Folder Tasks should be allowed\nIf the popup isn’t there do:\n⌘⇧p\n-> Manage Automatic Tasks in Folder\n-> Allow Automatic Tasks in Folder\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  🎉 All done!

Vou deixar alguns links legais pra você estudar TypeScript:\nO próprio site dará todo o suporte que você precisará: https://lnkd.in/dC4bbuX\n\n\nNo próprio site tem uma área pra você começar do zero: https://lnkd.in/dB8pTuj\n\n\n\nAgora só depende de você, estude, pratique e use TypeScript em seus novos projetos.\nFiquem com Deus e até a próxima.\nNunca desista de correr atrás dos seus sonhos",
