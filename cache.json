As we need to generate thumbnail images in the application where we think all aspect to improve the performace of the application. A very basic steps are needed to perform the task. In nodejs applicationi it is verydifficult to resize or compress the image while uploading with multer package(in case of uploading file to our own server).\nClick here to get complete working code.\nFor the image compression task we will use imagemagick package of nodejs. So at first we have to install imagemagick in our system, I am using linux with ubuntu. sudo apt-get install imagemagick will install the software in our system.\nNow create a file named server.js and create a basic app of nodejs. I am not adding much thing here in the demo to clear the actual concept for image compression task in nodejs application. So I have written very basic code in my demo. Lets have a look in code of my package.json.\n\n{\n    \"name\": \"node-resize-example\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"dependencies\": {\n       \"imagemagick\": \"0.1.2\"\n   }\n}\n\nIn the above file we can see that only one npm package has been installed.\nNow move to the next file, server.js. Lets have a look inside it.\nvar im = require('imagemagick')\n, path = require('path')\n\nlet convertArgs = [\n'./images/tes.jpg',\n'-resize',\n300 + 'x' + 300,\n'./images/thumbnail_test.jpg'\n];\n\nim.convert(convertArgs, function(err, metadata){\nif (err) throw err;\n\nconsole.log('success! Checkout your new thumb: ');\n});\n\nIn the above file at top we have required the node packages. below that we have created a variable named convertArgs having first value as the current image second and value as the required size of thumbnail/resized images and last value as the name of the new file. At the end we call the convert method of imagemagick which  is performing the actual task. By following these easy steps we can compress/resize image in our nodejs app.\nFor more info visit its official site : Click here to redirect",

Nowdays, it's hard to imagine software development lifecycle without automated solutions that take care of all those repetitive tasks. There is a ton of different technologies that can solve our problems and in this post we will focus on GitHub Actions.\nGitHub Actions are event-driven workflows that come right in your code repository. By saying event-driven, it means that you can execute series of commands when specific event occurs. For example, every time someone creates a pull request for a repository, you can automatically run a command that executes a software testing script. Aside from event trigger, procedure can also be scheduled.\nProcedures are defined in YAML file called workflow. Workflow co…",

Any write to a linux local filesystem is done 'buffered', unless explicitly defined it not to, which is done by opening the file with the O_DIRECT flag. So all file interactions from the shell likely are done buffered, and the Postgresql database is also using buffered IO.\nWhat happens when you perform a buffered write is that you don't actually write to the disk, but instead you write to memory. Because currently the latency of most disk IO/writes is still much higher than memory IO latency (~ 25us/modern SSD vs 160ns/memory, although very configuration specifi…",

The database is PostgreSQL. They are deployed as containers on Heroku and the HTTP communication is protected by JWT tokens.\nI describe the technique used to deploy them as containers on Heroku in this article on medium.\nYou can access this demo version running on Heroku and try it right now. But as this is only a demo, please don't use a real password there!\nThe application get dormant after some time without use, so the first access can take some extra time.\n\nShopping List is a web application that was created especially for mobile devices.\nYou'll be able to organize the products you want to buy and do your shopping more quickly.\nOnce you create one account, you can create shopping lists and add products to them.\nWhen you're buying products at the market, you can check the products updating your list and switch from one shopping list to other very easily.\nYou can, for instance, create one shopping list for fruits, other for cleaning products and another for grocery. So, in the top menu, you will be able to switch between these shopping lists while you're checking the products you already bought.\n\nApplication\nAPI swagger\nI used Angular Material and Angular Flex-Layout in this project.\nOn the Quarkus project I used Hibernate Panache to control the database and SmallRye JWT to protect the endpoints.\nPerhaps you can find it interesting the Swagger-UI, created automatically by the SmallRye OpenAPI, that has the possibility of doing one Authentication to test the endpoints protected by JWT.\nThanks for reading this article and feel free to talk with me in case you got interested in this project!",

We must define the generic model of all resources.\nIn this article, we assume that all models have some common properties like id, createdAt, and updatedAt.\nThus, we create a generic abstract class that contains all these common properties.\nT type to identify the model that we are g…",

          "description": "Let's see how easy it is to add heatmaps to tables in Angular using Directives. We'll go for a really simple and elegant solution to have separate heatmap colors to different columns in the table.\nAs I always say, Directives are a really powerful feature of Angular. It can be used as an elegant solution to implement a lot of cool functionalities. You can clearly see why the directive approach makes more sense when you reach the end of the post.\nEven though it's not that often we see heatmaps in tables, but heatmaps can really add some value in terms of visualization. It would make sense in data sets where there is some kind of comparison or range.\n\nIf you have this question in mind, here are some reasons which justify why creating a directive for implementing this feature will make sense.\n…",

It's been around in the industry for more than a couple of years (some of you reading this document are probably younger than layering) and it's one of the first architectural styles created. In short, layering is nothing more than dividing the concerns of your application into different layers, like in a cake, where the upper layers can talk to the bottom layers but no the other way around.\nLayers interact through facades, so as long as the public APIs are honored, a layer doesn't have to know anything about internal implementation details of other layers.\nLet's take a look at the following diagram:\n\nThe most typical layered architecture has th…",
