Basically it takes all your code, assets, dependencies and bundles them into static files that are easier to work with and deploy.

This can be simplified with managed identities available in the Microsoft Azure cloud. Let's see how to deal with secrets management in ASP .NET Core applications hosted on the Azure cloud.\nManaging secrets in cloud solutions can be a big challenge. Whether it's a database password or a connection string to access a specific service ‚Äî these values should be stored securely. In the Microsoft Azure cloud, there is a dedicated service called Azure Key Vault. It is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets. When thinking about secrets, we should have in mind that they can be in many different forms. A database password is a secret, a certificate is a secret, and a cryptographic key is also considered a secret.\nStoring secrets in places like a configuration file can expose our application to vulnerabilities similar to the ones due to bad programming practices or bugs. Many developers struggle with managing secrets properly and looking for a solution to test the application locally without worrying about secrets management after deployment. This is where Azure Key Vault and Azure managed identities can help.\nIn this article, we will explore how to set up Azure Key Vault, store the secret in it, and access this secret from the ASP .NET Core application using Azure managed identity. We will learn how to combine using secrets locally and access them after the deploying to the Azure cloud.\nRead more...",

Or does your company have requirements to be able to reproduce deployments and trace exactly what dependencies were used at a specific time? Great - continue reading!\nBeing dependent on open source üì¶ npm packages means dependencies to the public npm registry and npm package maintainers = constantly changing environment. This also means that you have the responsibility to keep track of what package versions were used in a specific deployment. This is a crucial task to reduce risks and make sure unintended changes have not been made.\nEven without any change to package.json your builds may produce a different set of dependencies at different points in time (semver versioning and addition of new minor versions to public registries).\nThe slightest change in patch versions means your builds are no longer deterministic where you are guaranteed the exact same results - and deploying dependencies that have not been tested is never a good idea...\nüí° For me, the way to go is to freeze your registry when you want to avoid accidental updates. Freezing a registry effectively locks down the state of your package versions and makes the registry read-only so that only intended changes are applied to code you trust.\nThe video below shows the easiest way to make your registry read-only using the Freeze policy in Bytesafe:\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of using the Freeze policy in Bytesafe:\n‚úÖ Guaranteed exact same versions when testing and building your applications\n‚úÖ Deterministic and consistent results across all your environments such as Test, UAT and Production\nüîó This blog post also describes how to work with the Freeze policy to achieve consistent tests and builds.\nI would love to hear what you think of this solution and how you avoid accidental updates today.

          "description": "The text editor I use daily is called vim (vi improved). It‚Äôs not a program for everybody, but it suits my needs well.\nVim is one of the most powerful text editor that exists. It's a program that you can configure to make it do anything. It has a steep learning curve, and can take months or years to master. \nVim can be used without the mouse, everything using key presses. My first experience with vi was really bad (I forgot everything about it) but once I got used to it and learned a couple of commands and a few ex commands I fell in love with vi.\nYou could wonder, when writing code why use a mouse at all?\nOnce you know the vim commands it's very easy to use. It's a great bonus that it can be used in the terminal, because it lets you quickly edit your system files or edit files remotely using ssh.\nI was a fairly experienced computer user. I started using a computer around age 12 or so, taught myself basic programming when I was about 13, and eventually became rather adept at various aspects of the art of computing.\n\nI found myself needing to do a lot of system administration, and in the past I would have used nano, but I decided to try vim. I‚Äôd heard good things about it in the past but had never really tried it, so I was curious.\nHere are some reasons I switched to vi/vim : \n1) It is extremely fast \nVim is probably installed on your computer, if you open a terminal you can type\n$ vim\n\nAnd to exit press ZQ. If in the rare situation it's not installed, it is available in your package manager. However, even on a commercial OS like Mac OS X vim is available by default.\nIf you are new to vim, you can practice here",

The end result would be something like this:\n\nLet's break up this implementation into 3 steps:\n‚úîÔ∏è Set up the scroll-to-top button (with some nice styling).\nI have used @angular/material for some easy styling. In order to display the button fixed to the bottom-right corner of the page (and some nice hover effects with opacity), I have used the below properties on the :host -\n\nThis is an interesting section. To begin with, we need to set up an Observable on the scroll event of the DOCUMENT. You may directly access the document object, or you may use an InjectionToken<Document>, provided by angular.\nThis observable starts emitting values as soon as the user starts to scroll up or down. Now we are not really interested in the actual scroll event, but we would like to check something important every time the scroll event is fired - and that is the scroll position. Angular makes this quite simple with the ViewportScroller service from @angular/common package. This service has few useful methods, and I am going to use two of them - getScrollPosition and scrollToPosition.\n\nThe getScrollPosition method returns an array of 2 numbers - the X and Y coordinate. I check if the Y coordinate is more than 0 (which means the user has scrolled down) and I enable the scroll-to-top button.\nFor this last part, I make use of the scrollToPosition method, which again takes in the X and Y coordinates, and I scroll to [0, 0].\n\nCheers :-)",

In our case we could split a deck of cards into clubs, spades, diamods and hearts correspondently.\nFor the sake of simplicity our deck will have only 4 cards, namely 4 aces, one from each suit, here's our small deck:\ninterface Card {\n  name: st‚Ä¶",
