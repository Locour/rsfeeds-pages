          "description": "Our goal at Knock is to empower people to move freely. A large part of achieving that goal is to make real estate transactions as easy and seamless as possible for our customers. Real estate transactions are very complicated. Calling them a \"big ball of mud\" is being gracious. If we could sum up such transactions up in one image, it would be the image of Charlie Day explaining how a person named Pepe Silvia doesn't exist:\n\nFor us as an engineering team, this translates into a lot of complex business logic. And we want to do our best to make sure that logic is sound. If our logic is faulty it can lead to thousands of dollars of disappointment. We do not want that. Thus, we thoroughly test our code via unit testing.\nWe are in a growth stage at Knock so we are regularly bringing on new engineers. During this process we have learned that it can be difficult for new engineers to come to grips with our testing code base while at the same time recognizing the patterns and strategies used in our unit tests. As a result, we have started a new open repository that provides lessons for any engineer to learn from and reference. We think this repository fills a gap in the community and are thus making it available for anyone to reference and contribute to: https://github.com/knockaway/unit-test-patterns-and-strategies.\nHave we missed any patterns or strategies? We welcome pull requests to add more. And if you're looking to join a team that cares about the quality of their code, we're hiring!",

It is not uncommon to have to wait 30 seconds or more before your application can begin serving traffic, which becomes a problem on platforms that scale down to zero waiting for incoming traffic and expect to quickly launch an application to process a request.\nQuarkus is a container native platform that addresses many of these performance issues, and in this blog post, we'll take a look at a simple Quarkus web application exposing a REST endpoint protected by Auth0.\nQuarkus has been designed to address the needs of serverless and container environments by reducing startup times and memory consumption. Perhaps the most exciting thing about Quarkus is its tight integration with GraalVM to allow applications to be compiled into native binaries.\nQuarkus integrates with a huge range of libraries, giving developers access to many familiar platforms and allowing for the migration of existing code bases. These libraries are selected or customized to run seamlessly on Quarkus and to be able to take advantage of native compilation.\nOf course, authentication is a central requirement of any modern web application, and Quarkus has out of the box support for OAuth, which in turn can be integrated into Auth0.\nRead more...",

          "description": "The split method splits a string into an array of strings. It takes an argument for the delimiter, which can be a character to use to break up the string or a regular expression. For example, if the delimiter is a space, you get an array of words, and if the delimiter is an empty string, you get an array of each character in the string.\n\n\nHere are two examples that split one string by spaces, then another by digits using a regular expression:\n\n\n\n\nlet str = \"Hello World\";\nlet byWords = str.split(\" \");\n\nlet otherString = \"How9are7you2today\";\nlet byDigits = otherString.split(/\\d/);\n\n// byWords would have the value [\"Hello\", \"World\"]\n// byDigits would have the value [\"How\", \"are\", \"you\", \"today\"]\n\nNow let's use the split method inside the splitify function to split str into an array of words. The function should return the array. Note that the words are not always separated by spaces, and the array should not contain punctuation.\n\n\n\n\nfunction splitify(str) {\n  // Only change code below this line\n\n\n  // Only change code above this line\n}\nsplitify(\"Hello World,I-am code\");\n\nIf you remember from my other posts simply split the string to create a new array of words. A simple regular expression can be used to achieve this result.\n/\\W/ Matches any non-word character. This includes spaces and punctuation, but not underscores.

In this post, we‚Äôll go through the steps to ensure that your script will run correctly üòâ\nThe first step is to make a bash script. Any bash script uses the Linux commands.  A script can simply be a file with a list of commands and the .sh extension. If you are new to Linux, you can use this site to practice. \nThe second step is to make sure that your script file is executable. In Linux and macOS, you can check if a file is executable by running the ls -l command and then looking for an x in the permissions column. \nThe example below shows the difference:\n$ ls -l *.sh\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 frank frank   43 mei 29 16:30 hello.sh\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 frank frank 8192 jul  1 19:41 not-executable.sh\n\nIf it isn‚Äôt executable, run the following command in Terminal.\nchmod +x script.sh\n\nTo start a script you write:\n./script.sh\n\nI can write a shell script when I need to, but then continue working in Python or Perl or C++ or whatever real programming language I'm most comfortable with at the time (these days mostly C++).\nFor example, one of my recent side projects involved crunching data from a database, working with various embedded systems and more. Shell is not the right tool for that kind of application.\nBash is more suited for when you write a lot of commands in the shell anyway and want to automate that.",

Of course you can write Python code in any editor you want, I find for small scripts it's very practical to fire up vim.\nAn introduction to vim. This article shows you the basics of vim.

You can also use vim-mode inside visual studio code or phpstorm.\nA cheatsheet for vim. Shows an overview for the vim commands.

How to create an LVM volume, how to configure and mount it in your operating system, how to add and remove disks, and how to recover the information you have accidentally deleted? In today‚Äôs article, you will find all of that ‚Äì and even more.\n\nLVM (Logical Volume Manager) is a standard disk management feature available in every version of Linux. The volume manager provides a new level of interaction between your operating system and disks or volumes which this system is using. In a conventional disk management pattern, Linux looks for available drives first, and then checks what volumes are available on these devices.\nWith the help of LVM, disks or volumes can be united into a single space.
