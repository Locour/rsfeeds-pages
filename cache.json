In this post, I'll explain what IDOR is, what causes it, and ways to protect your application against it.\nIDOR is an access control vulnerability that occurs when an application uses an identifier for direct access to an object in a database but doesn't perform proper access control or authorization checks before querying or modifying the database.

          "description": "Today I will show you how to install Docker in Linux Mint and Ubuntu. Docker is a very useful tool which every developer should know. Using Docker you can run many applications with special containers. They are beside your system. For instance you code in php and you need php in your system to run application. With Docker you can install and run many versions of php. Let’s start!\nFirst of all we should update the package lists:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNext we have to install dependencies:\nsudo apt-get -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common\n\nPerhaps you have installed all dependencies. After installing dependencies we have to add GPG key:\ncurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -\n\nand repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release; echo \"$UBUNTU_CODENAME\") stable\"\n\nWhen we add a new repository we have to remember to update package lists. So one more time we run sudo apt-get update .\nThen we can install Docker in Linux Mint and Ubuntu (we install also docker-compose):\nsudo apt-get install docker docker-compose\n\nAfter installing Docker we have to add our user to a docker group:\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n\nIt is necessary in order to run Docker without root privileges (without sudo). In my opinion running Docker with sudo is not a good idea. Remember restart machine after adding your user to group!\nWe can check our installation:\ndocker -v\ndocker-compose -v\ndocker run hello world\n\nYou should see the version of docker and docker-compose.\n\nI wrote a shell script which install Docker in Linux Mint and Ubuntu automatically:\nYou can get it on my GitHub.\nYou can see tutorial on YouTube.",

Well, my dad uses Windows, but that's not the reason you should hate Windows OS.\nMicrosoft Windows is with us from the start of OS development, from 1985. But this is also not the reason you shouldn't hate Windows.\nThe only reason I am stuck on Linux/Debian OS is that it is good enough to fulfil my requirements. Similarly, many people are stuck in Windows because it is good enough to fulfil their requirements. \nWell, one of my college friends tried Linux, he search for a piece of software to do some writing stuff, he got LibreOffice, and tried it. FOR HIM, LibreOffice wasn't good enough. I told him to use Google Docs as well, but at the end of the day, it didn't match with him.\nAlso, he was a Valorant player friend. He search how to install Valorant in Linux? And guess what, he got disappointed, Valorant isn't playable in Linux, aka: BANNED\nSo, we need to keep in mind that if something fulfils our requirement why one should change he/her workflow.\nIn a nutshell, we all want our tasks to be accomplished as soon as possible. If something we currently own and does the task we want without any issue, we're good to go with it.\n#peace #linux #amen",

Added features in typescript include the use of types, it also helps us be more explicit and clearer about our code.\nLets look at two code snippets one with Plain Javascript and another in typescript .\nPlain Javascript\n  let inputA = 1\n  let inputB = 2\n  function sum(inputA, inputB){\n     console.log(inputA + inputB)\n  }\n  sum(inputA,inputB)\n  //this will return 3\n  //Now what if we change the inputs to be\n  inputA = \"1\"\n  inputB = \"2\"\n  sum(inputA,inputB)\n //this will return 12\n\nDespite the second answer being wrong, we dont get an error notification at run time. Here is when typescript comes in with its additional type feature that guarantees we get the correct answer or an error.In typescript this would be written as(you can test this code in the TS playground):\n    let inputA = 1\n    let inputB = 2\n    funtion sum(inputA: number,inputB: number){\n     console.log(inputA + inputB)\n    }\n    sum(inputA,inputB)\n    //prints 3\n    //Now what if we change the inputs to be\n    inputA = \"1\"\n    inputB = \"2\"\n    sum(inputA,inputB)\n    //script.ts(6,9): error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.\n\n\nThrough the introduction of types in typescript, it easier to write more intuitive code.

You might have wonder why would we need a test if our program is running and not crashing? From my point of view, testing not only figure it out the bugs, make sure very branches is tested but also help you with the designing of your software. When making test for this week, I have to actually refactor my code a bit more so as to be able to test it out such as exposing proccessMarkdown() in html-maker so as to test it out\nmodule.exports.processingFile = processingFile;\nmodule.exports.processMarkdown = processMarkdown;\n\nThe test I have written is very simple since my program is still very small.\nTo be able to use Jest proficiently with Typescript, we will need help from ts-jest\nnpm i -D j…",

It gets a bad rap, but there is a lot to like about XML as a config file format, including great tooling support and a robust schema definition language in XSD. \nJSON: Extremely common as a data interchange format in REST APIs, and also very popular as a config file format.
