When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

          "description": "If you are new here, then please visit our earlier article over here for some context. \nAfter the last article we were trying to find out ways to improve upon the approach but at the same time didn't want to do anything crazy either. \nThat is when we found out about Buddy. Buddy is one of those easy DIY devops tools out there. Best part is the UI and how easy it is to create a deployment pipeline. \nOkay so back to our task. We added this line in our package.json file under the build script.\n    \"build\": \"nest build && mkdir -p build && node obfuscate.js && find ./build -name '*.ts' -type f -delete && cp package.json build/\",\n\nThe above line creates a folder called build, obfuscates(make it unreadable) and remove all the .ts files. We also had to copy our package.json file into the build folder so that we can install our dependencies at our destination.\nThen we setup a pipeline in Buddy. \n\nWe made 3 actions. Actions are more like a sequence of steps.  \nThe first one \"Execute\" created a build folder and obfuscated code.\n\n\n\nThe second one copied the build folder to the client's server.\n\n\n\nThe third one basically started the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Feel good moment\n\n\nOnce the actions were setup we started our pipeline and kept looking at this \"feels good\" UI while it was running.\n\nAfter the pipeline completed, we logged into our server and were able to see our instance running. Phew!!! And this is how our code looks now. Not the best of encryption, but pretty hard to read/modify.\n\nThis solved our problem to a major extent. The only drawback we found was the speed of execution. It takes around 2-3 minutes for the entire process to complete. But we are sure there are ways to optimize it. So we are looking forward to it.\nLet us know your comments.\nHappy programming!!!",

From one-click checkouts on Amazon to Single Sign-On across all of Google’s services, consumers have never had it better for digital experiences….and they are now expecting it everywhere they go online. \n\nLogin boxes are the first thing many people engage with on a website.

But one that might get overlooked is the filename.\nChecking the filename is especially important when it displayed on a web page to prevent HTML or XSS injection. That’s just on the frontend. On the backend, there are the other usual injections to worry about. Like SQL injection, when storing the name in a database.

          "description": "Computer Vision(CV) is a field of Artificial Intelligence(AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs- and make recommended output based on that.\n\n\nIf AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.\nCV trains their machine to do such work but it should do those work in lesser time with the use of cameras or algorithms as compare to retina or nerves.\n48.6 billion by 2022.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  How does Computer vision works?\n\n\nComputer vision requires lots of data for getting good accuracy.\nopenCV \nThere are many research has done in this field, but apart from it there are many uses of CV in business, entertainment, transportation, healthcare and everyday life.\nImage Classification:\nIt sees an image and can classify it (a dog, an apple, a person’s face).\nObject detection:\nIt can use image classification to identify a certain class of image and then detect and tabulate their appearance in an image or video.\nObject Tracking:\nIt follows or tracks an object once it is detected. This task is executed by with image capturing in sequence or real-time.\nContent-based image retrieval:\nIt uses computer vision to browse, search and retrieve images from large data stores, based on the content of the images rather than metadata tags associated with them.(PS:This is most useful application of CV)\nYou can check out my github repository where I have made many projects based on CV.\nOpenCV-Tutorial\nProjects\nNow it's time to explore friends.\nLinkedln\nTwitter\nThanks for reading.\nRishabh Dwivedi",

          "description": "For the last couple of years, I have been in the Linux space and mostly tried to find the best distro, best file manager, best terminal etc. I was caught up in the loop of finding the best programs to handle a job. This approach, unless controlled, usually leads to low productivity in the long term.\nHow so you might ask ? Well, this behavior is really relatable for some people. When I am talking about this subject, some of you might probably say, \"Oh yes I have been there\". In Linux world, there is even a term for this. Ricing.\nRicing means tweaking the configuration of your working environment to suit your personal needs. At particular level, one might consider this useful, and it indeed is. There are some workflow approaches, shortcuts and others that helps the developer access files and folders faster, learn by muscle memory and perform some set of actions quicker. Past that particular level and you are now in the over-ricing zone. Where you are essentially tweaking every aspect of each program, work environment to your needs, but at the same time you are never satisfied so you keep tweaking and changing settings, configs and what not. It reduces your productivity and at the end of the day when you look back, you realize you have done nothing but tweaking some stuff to find the best work environment.\nThis is what I call the loop (referring to the Bandersnatch here). You are in the loop. You need to get out and you need to get sh*t done. Don't worry about using the best tool out there, don't try to find the absolute efficient program. Just get it done.\nThis is in actuality a paradox. The paradox goes as such, \"The more choices you have, the less satisfied you are\". Seems about right when you think for a bit.",

I absolutely love being part of this vast community of great individuals.\n\"Linux is difficult\" - \"Packaging is hard\" was once the most predominant ways for software companies to tell users, why they didn't support Linux. \nBut these days we got things like AppImages[1], which I think is very underappreciated within the community (just a feeling, no figures to back it up). Actually I'm unaware why AppImages aren't already part of all Linux distros out there. I guess it's because everyone is trying to roll their own distribution formats?\nAnyway, An AppImage is a container format much akin to Mac Applications. You just download an AppImage from e.g. AppImageHub[2], set the execute permission on the file and off you go. No installation required - you can even place the AppImage file where ever you'd like. If you want to skip the \"set execute bit\" step and need tighter GUI integration there's a daemon called appimaged[3] that you can run beforehand which will take care of all this.\n[1] https://appimage.org/\nhttps://www.appimagehub.com/\nhttps://github.com/probonopd/go-appimage",

It's not just for programmers, though. Vim is perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing configuration files.\nThe vim text editor is an extremely powerful tool for developers, but it can be difficult to master.  If you are new to vim, I recommend these exercises\nIf you're using a Mac or a Linux machine, it's likely that your terminal has vim built in, so it's worth being familiar with to work on those systems. \nIf not, you can install vim with your package manager or test if vi is installed.\nTo install vim for Ubuntu, follow these instructions.\n1: Open a terminal window and type sudo apt-get install vim\nsudo apt-get install vim\n\n2: If you want to get updated version of vim, open a terminal window and type sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get update\n\n3: Then type sudo apt-get install vim\nsudo apt-get install vim\n\nThe installation process will take some time, after which all the commands of vim will be available.\n\nTo start vim, just type vim in the command line\nvim\n\nThen you can type ESC followed by :e filename to open filename.\nTo open a vim directly from the command line, type:\nvim filename\n\nPress ZQ to quit vim without saving. Press ZZ to save and exit.\nTo move the cursor, you can press ESC and use the keys h,j,k,l.  You can also use the arrow keys in vim.\n\nVim has modes.

This can lead to extremely messy code or Angular code that is hard to maintain as a project grows.\nThe reason I feel this happens is Angular is an opinionated framework, there is an approach you take to write Angular apps.

These applications regularly employ components in which the majority of the component’s runtime display is driven by external data. We are all familiar with using binding to alter some portion of a component. A fully data-driven component will also have other aspects of its display controlled by external data.\nFor example, it is common in the utility industry to display, analyze, and even edit load profiles. Each profile contains one or more time series such as ‘raw data,’ ‘cleansed data’, ‘gross’, ‘AMI’, etc. Each of these series has some meaning t…",

Up until recently React didn't have a built-in solution for application state management. For many years Redux was a go-to library which solved that problem. But things have changed, React evolved and now we've got Hooks! One of them is especially interesting. Everyone, welcome useContext!\nIf you're building a small web app, you might not need to use Redux for managing your application's state, React already comes with Context and in this tutorial I'll show you how to handle sitewide file uploads, so that you can freely navigate in your app without having to worry that that 1GB file which you've been uploading for the last half an hour suddenly stops and you'll need to upload it again... an…",

E.g. if they were functions they would be implemented like this.\nfunction or(a, b) {\n  if (a) {\n    return a\n  }\n  return b\n}\n\nfunction and(a, b) {\n  if (a) {\n    return b\n  }\n  return a\n}\n\nIt may sound and look a bit confusing, but let’s dive into examples.\nlet obj = { prop: 1 }\n\n// boring part\ntrue || false // -> true\nfalse || true // -> true\ntrue && false // -> false\nfalse && true …",

          "description": "TypeScript is 🔥 - this seems to be a common understanding now in the frontend community. Many developers expect libraries to either be written in TypeScript, or at least provide good type definitions. For me, if a library is written in TypeScript, the type definitions are the best documentation there is. It's never wrong because it directly reflects the implementation. I frequently look at type definitions before I read API docs.\nReact Query was initially written in JavaScript (v1), and was then re-written to TypeScript with v2. This means that right now, there is very good support for TypeScript consumers.\nThere are however a couple of \"gotchas\" when working with TypeScript due to how dynamic and unopinionated React Query is.

This is beneficial, because it allows us to change our app configuration without changing any of the code in our codebase.\nHowever, we want to ensure that all of the environmental variables needed for our app to run are set when our app starts.
