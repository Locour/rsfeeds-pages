Each generated process has it's own event loop, V8 instance and memory. The primary process and worker process communicate with each other via IPC (Inter-Process Communication).\nNote: Code from this tutorial will be available in this repository\nLet's initialize and setup our project!\n$ yarn init -y\n$ yarn add express typescript ts-node\n$ yarn add -D @types/nod‚Ä¶",

So this is the lab 03, which I have to create 2 parallel branches to work on different aspects of the program.\nFirst off, I needed to decide what to add to my program. At the time, I had a few options like changing code block, or hr, or exit code for my program... So I thought that the exit code is a must that my program needed to have and the code block thing is quite more interesting than hr. After choosing what I needed to do, I had to file 2 issues so I had something to refer back to. \nThe 2 issues I was talking about:\nFirst one\nSecond one\nWriting code for these 2 issues are quite straightforward. It took me a few minutes to finish it. However, I'm not so sure about the inline code block thing, and should ask my professor about it to make sure that's what he's looking for. \nSo, for the first issue, I created a new branch called issue-18 and issue-19 for the second issue. When finishing the first issue, I had to git add and git commit and switched to branch issue-19 to continue coding. As I've done it, I also had to git add and git commit. After that, I had to use merge to merge those 2 branches. \nI used git merge issue-18 which is my first issue, git had no problem merging it. It was fast forward right away. However, for the second issue, when I git merge issue-19, instead of fast forward, Git used three way recursive strategy. Then, I just needed to push it to github so the code will be visible to everyone. \nProject Repo\nCommit 1\nCommit 2",

          "description": "üîç Here‚Äôs an easy-to-understand analogy to help your non-technical friends and customers understand public keys and private keys, and how they relate to cryptography and digital signatures.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \nIf you work in cybersecurity or any computer-related field, sooner or later, you‚Äôll have to explain public-key cryptography and digital signatures to non-technical people. With the recent rise of remote work and stories about system breaches, computer security has become a topic of discussion even among laypeople.\nAfter trying to explain public-key cryptography and digital signatures to some clients with varying degrees of success, I wanted to develop an analogy that explained them and was easy to remember. I‚Äôve found that even techies get confused by the formal definitions, and many non-technical explanations just seem unsatisfying.\nThat‚Äôs when I stumbled upon Panayotis Vryonis‚Äô article, Public-key cryptography for non-geeks. It became my go-to analogy until my computer science professor, Dr. Robin Dawes pointed out a flaw. I refined it with his help, and a suggestion from Matthew Ernest, and the result is below. I hope you find it helpful when trying to explain these concepts to anyone!\nImagine a box with a special lock, as pictured below:\n\nThe lock has three positions:\nWhen the lock is at the ‚Äú9:00‚Äù position, the box is locked, and its contents are inaccessible.\nWhen the lock is at the ‚Äú12:00‚Äù position, the box is unlocked, which means you can open it and view its contents.\nWhen the lock is at the ‚Äú3:00‚Äù position, the box is locked, and its contents are inaccessible.\nIn order to avoid wandering into endless ‚ÄúWhat if...?‚Äù tangents, assume that it‚Äôs prohibitively costly to pick the lock or break the box.\nRead more...",

By using symmetric encryption algorithms, data is converted to a form that cannot be understood by anyone who does not possess the secret key to decrypt it.\nAdvanced Encryption Standard (also known as Rijndael), is one of the best symmetric encryption algorithm. AES is a block encryption algorithm and thus supports five modes which are as follows:\nECB mode: Electronic Code Book mode\nCBC mode: Cipher Block Chaining mode\nCFB mode: Cipher Feedback mode\nOFB mode: Output ‚Ä¶",

In this post we shall be exploring AWS load balancer, types of AWS load balancers, when to use them and how to setup load balancers on AWS Management console.\nload Balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 instances) downstream.\n\n1.Spread load across multiple downstream instances\nAn ELB(EC2 Load Balancer ) is a managed load balancers by AWS. Meaning AWS guarantees that it will be working. AWS takes care of upgrades ,maintenance, high availability across multiple zones. It costs less to setup your own load balancers but it would be a lot of effort on your end.\nThey are support important for load balancers. They enable the load balancer to know if instances it forward traffic to are available to reply to requests. The health check is done on a port and a route. If  the response is not 200 (OK) ,then the instance is unhealthy.\n\n1.Classic load Balances(V1 -old generation)-2009\nLoad Balancer can scale but not instantaneously if you have a massive scale to do you need to contact AWS for a \"Warm-up\".\nFor Troubleshooting\nIn the next post we shall be setting up ELb .Thanks for reading.",

For eg : if you have a dual boot system established in your pc and your linux OS doesn't have access to the D folder.If you run this command on your linux terminal then you wont be able to see the partiton of used and unused space of D folder. this command is same as when you open the disk management tool in windows.\n\n\n\ntop\n\nThis command when you type in your terminal it will show the active linux processes which are managed by your linux kernel. This command is used like how you would use task manager in windows, the difference being , it shows the details of all the processes in far more depth than windows does.\nit will look something like this when you type the command.\n\n\nthis is what is meant by each column head.\n\nyou can press 'q' to exit this window in your termial.\nls\n  \n\n\ncd\ncd [directory name]\ncd ..\n\n\ntouch\ntouch [filename.extension]",

If there's any clarification needed because my question is not preicse enough I'll gladly provide!\nSo as part of my current education we're doing something they call pop-up internship where you go to visit a company for a day or two and run through a couple different departments to get a feel for how different companies might tackle some of the daily tasks they encounter.\nOne company in particular had an app in development that really got me interested. They were building a web application for one of their customers based on the Angular framework from what I understand. The backend/serverside code was written in Java. The interesting part is that they used some way to turn the expoted Java-WAR into a file they would include in the Angular project. This allowed them to call methods from that service and, what was the most interesting to me, the classes for the project were only defined in that Java code yet perfectly usable in that Angular code. I saw some kind of service URL in the code which I assume is somehow being used to make the actual calls in some way.\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to dig deep enough/get into the deeper questions I had regarding the whole procedure. \nI don't have any experience with Java, writing mostly little PHP and C# applications so far so I wondered - is a model like this possible to set up with Angular and PHP? If yes, where do I need to look in terms of guidance to set something like that up with my Angular project? What are some key things I need to know before tackling something like this? Is it even worth doing like that?\nThere's a lot floating in my head right now regarding this because this is kinda exciting to me, any and all help would be greatly appreciated",

Today we‚Äôre excited to announce the new free Tailwind theme to join the already impressive lineup featuring Material, Bootstrap, FluentUI and PrimeOnes themes.\nThe new theme uses the official color palette from Tailwind and based on the design bits at Tailwind UI such as forms, modals and menus. If you are utilizing tailwind ui and looking for a fully featured UI component library, PrimeFaces with the Tailwind theme will be an excellent choice. Note that, the theme does not use tailwind classes and instead provides a look-alike style for a unified design when used together.\n\nImage is a new addition to the UI suite to display an image with transformation options like rotate and zoom. For multiple images, please see the Galleria.\n\nThere are over 30 improvements in this release, defect fixes are mostly based on community feedback so thank you for helping us to make the library better.\nPrimeNG is licensed under MIT and free to download at NPM.\nOur current focus is on improving accessibility by creating a dedicated section per component for keyboard support and screen readers along with scores from audit tools.",

I've finally got around to turning it into an open-source library called \"Be Our Guest.\" The name is inspired by the Disney song from Beauty and the Beast and the lyric \"put our service to the test.\"\nIt is an ASYNC service container that enables your node or browser applications to implement an Inversion of Control architecture for it's modules and dependencies. You may be thinking, \"why do I need this?\"\nAs an example to illustrate it's value, let's say we have a module that handles auth within our application.

So, to take advantage of all the cores available we need to launch a cluster of Node.js processes.\nFor this we can use the native cluster module which creates several child processes (workers) that operate parallelly. Each generated process has it's own event loop, V8 instance and memory. The primary process and worker process communicate with each other via IPC (Inter-Process Communication).\nNote: Code from this tutorial will be available in this repository\nLet's initialize and setup our project!\n$ yarn init -y\n$ yarn add express typescript ts-node\n$ yarn add -D @types/nod‚Ä¶",

In the case of action:'setTitle', the value would then be the title you want to set on the state object.

The responsiveness of react-avatar-group is meant to be similar to the Google Docs user icons. Some live examples are available here.\nIf you need a more in-depth tutorial on using this package with actual, live users, check out this post here. Otherwise, here's a quick walk-through on how to use this package.\n\nFirst, install the package:\nnpm install react-avatar-group\n\nThen open up your React file and import the package, as follows:\n// App.tsx\nimport AvatarGroup from 'react-avatar-group';\n\nexport default function App(){\n  <AvatarGroup\n    avatars={[\n      \"James\", \n      \"Ava\", \n      {\n        avatar: \"Jackson\",\n        fontColor: \"FF00FF\",\n        tooltip: \"This is a custom tooltip\"\n      }\n    ]}\n  />\n}\n\nThe only required prop to the AvatarGroup component is avatars, which is an array of strings or IAvatar objects, for more customization.\nAnother important prop is max. This will hide the avatars beyond a certain length with a custom overflow avatar (as seen in the gif above). displayAllOnHover will show all minions passed when the mouse hovers the avatar group, if there is a max number passed.\nAll the props for react-avatar-group can be seen here.\nUsing these other props, your AvatarGroup may look like the following:\nimport AvatarGroup from 'react-avatar-group';\n\nexport default function App(){\n  <AvatarGroup\n    avatars={[\n      \"James\", \n      \"Ava\", \n      {\n        avatar: \"Jackson\",\n        fontColor: \"FF00FF\",\n        tooltip: \"This is a custom tooltip\"\n      }\n    ]}\n    initialCharacters={1}\n    max={3}\n    size={60}\n    displayAllOnHover\n    shadow={2}\n  />\n}",
