                    <span>Introduction


Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 13 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
Form validation enables the quality, accuracy, and integrity of the user input data. It’s possible to validate a form in Angular in two ways, one with reactive (using functions in the component class) and the other with template-driven forms (using attributes in the HTML) and we will use the template-driven forms way.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the application with the Angular base structure using the @angular/cli with the route file and the SCSS style…</span>

                    <span>These are some rules that I have lazily picked up over the past four years of professional development on angular.
I generally work on small to medium projects without the time to integrate a formal state management system.
It is for this reason that there are data services that try to solve the problem of carrying communication around. If anyone has any further questions or curiosities regarding these points feel free to leave a comment.
methods must be extracted into functions until nothing can be extracted anymore
the component logic shold refer only to local resources of the component as much as possible
dataservices deal with data I/O with the server
the business Logic must live within the dataservice and all components should be of assistance to the business Logic, visualization assistance and small local logics to visualize and modify data
components (internal to the feature internal to the root component) must implement the root dataservice or receive data as input (observables are strongly preferred)
avoid multi-level handovers through inputs, it slows you down and makes refactoring a hassle
if the data as input changed hands more than twice use a dataservice,
each feature must have its own module and declare components related only to that feature
putting the general dataservice next to the feature module is the best way to indicate the root from which to start exploring the code
the beginning of the end of the data flow must take place within the dataservice

the substrate cache-services for API calls must live in the provide of the feature module they belong to and refer to
components  can be interaction contexts between dataservices but services are preferred when possible
interaction services can be interaction contexts between dataservices</span>

                    <span>So, recently I ran into an issue where one of my functions was not being implemented &quot;at the correct time.&quot; The solution was to trigger it in another component via ngOnInit.
Moving the code was simple, but in the process I ran into an issue that I&#x27;ve seen before but not dug into.
The issue is that I like to use fat-arrow functions in my code (() &#x3D;&gt; {}) and somewhere along the way I converted an ngOnInit to fat-arrow. I unknowingly broke the OnInit lifecycle hook complete.
ngOnInit &#x3D; async (): Promise &#x3D;&gt; {
  await this.init();
  ...
};

The fix was actually pretty simple, I converted the code back to a traditional function pattern ...
async ngOnInit(): Promise {
  await this.init();
  ...
}

... and my function started working again.
Be careful (yes, I am telling myself this) as you may inadvertently write code that does not execute correctly. It was a simple mistake and one that was hidden by some layers of async behavior.</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(2 min)</span>
                    <span>Suppose you have the requirement that you want to show list of users if the url is /user, and you want to show user detail of a particular user when the URL is /user/useId.
To achieve this we can create a users component, then in its ngOnInit we could check if params are present.
/// Here route is ActivatedRoute

this.route.queryParams.subscribe(params &#x3D;&gt; {

if(params.userId){
//// Do Something
console.log(params.userId);
}
});


You can get the params like this and then write your logic accordindly. If params are present then show userDetails if not then list of users.
Like So
const routes: Routes &#x3D; [
  { path: &#x27;/user&#x27;, component: UsersComponent },
  { path: &#x27;/user:userId&#x27;, component : UserDetailsComponent}
];

Here we are explicitly stating that if url is /user then show UsersComponent or if it is like /users/xxxid then show userDetials page.
This is more Systematic &amp; preferred way of doing the task.
If you are using only one parameter then use parameterized route. But if you have many parameters then use querry Params as stated above in solution 1.

  {{user.name}}


Assume we are having list users and clicking on a user name will open that particlular user details.
To get the value of ther parameter use ActivatedRoute
console.log(this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get(&#x27;userId&#x27;);

Points To remember
If you are getting any error remember to recheck the route you had written. sometimes you append extra / like user/:userId/ or prepend extra slash (/) like /user/:userId.
Although you can use more then two parameters
like  user/:userId/:id/:age 
I would suggest to avoid it and if it cannot be avoided atleast limit it to two parameters.</span>

                    <span>What is RxJs?


Reactive Extensions for JavaScriptis a library for reactive programming. RxJS uses observables which will make it easier to compose call back-based code or asynchronous code.
If you are working with Angular, you should at least be familiar with RxJs.The angular framework itself is build using RxJs and around some of the RxJs concepts. We can do much more by using RxJs and observable like better and more readable code and we can even reduce the number of lines of code
The component is a key part of the Angular App structure. Everything in Angular comes around the state of the component and how it will be projected in the UI. On many occasions, we can use streams that will help us to represent volatile pieces of our data inside the view.

                    <span>You have two possibilities to access the path params in angular navigation. The first one, asynchronous, is to subscribe to the Observable observable, which you can access via paramMap method of the ActivatedRoute. Then use the get method with parameter you want to get as argument, as in the example below in the ngOnInit method:
// other imports ignored for breviyty
import { ActivatedRoute } from &#x27;@angular/router&#x27;;
import { switchMap } from &#x27;rxjs/operators&#x27;;

Na SRE, queremos dedicar mais tempo ao trabalho de projeto de engenharia de longo prazo, ao invés do trabalho operacional. Como o termo trabalho operacional pode ser mal interpretado, usamos uma palavra específica: toil.
toil


toil não é apenas “trabalho que não gosto de fazer”. Também não é equivalente a tarefas administrativas ou trabalho sujo. As preferências quanto aos tipos de trabalho que são satisfatórios e agradáveis variam de pessoa para pessoa e algumas pessoas até gostam de trabalhos manuais e repetitivos.

GitHub Actions helps automate tasks within your software development life cycle. They are event-driven, meaning that you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred. For example, every time someone creates a pull request for a repository, you can automatically run a command that executes a software testing script. In fact you can create any sort of creative automation using GitHub Actions.
GitHub Actions consists of a few different components, let&#x27;s take a look at some of these components in a bit more detail.
Workflows

Idea was to create some checksum for every subproject, then use that checksum for cache-from, cache-to source/destination.

In our case it worked but did not give a very significant advantage. Given the number of different builds, we got that the time to download all the cache was comparable to the build time.
Also having that we use yarn based monorepo to reuse docker layering we created internal prune util which is not that simple and adds additional steps to the build. (about prune you can read at amazing turborepo)

This post was full of personal preferences, and i&#x27;m writing this based on my experience as hybrid mobile (React Native) developer.
As a mobile developer we are expected to build the apps artifacts (.apk/.ipa). Here was my problem when dealing with build/archiving apps artifacts:
As the code base grew larger, so does the build time. My current project took almost 15 mins for android and 35 mins for iOS.
When we are building the artifacts we can&#x27;t change branch or run our code in simulator. Thus, (i assume) we can&#x27;t code the new feature or fixing the issues while waiting for our build.
Building artifacts take a lot of computer resources (at least for iOS).
Those was my biggest problem aside from being noob to setup local environment to build the artifacts 🥲.
And App Center Buil…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


I ran into a situation where I had to put certain metrics alert for a couple of mongodb instances. This was a challenge as I couldnot find direct resources for the setup we were trying to achieve. So this article will help you plugin multiple mongodb sources and visualise them on Grafana. 
The setup we are doing would require Docker installed on your system/server.
Go to your mongodb shell and create a user . This user will be used by mongodb exporter to export the metrices and forward them to Prometheus.
&gt;use admin
&gt;db.createUser(
  {
    user: &quot;mongodb_exporter&quot;,
    pwd: &quot;your_unique_password&quot;,
    roles: [
        { role: &quot;clusterMonitor&quot;, db: &quot;admin&quot; },
        { role: &quot;read&quot;, db: &quot;local&quot; }
    ]
  }
)

Here I am using Bitnami&#x27;s Docker Image for exporting the metrices.

                    <span>Let’s say you are writing a shell script for a systems housekeeping task. Perhaps the script is uploading backups to a remote server, or it is cleaning up old data, or it is making a measurement and submitting it to a somebody else’s HTTP API. What is the least cumbersome way for the script to contact you in case of problems? Let’s say you want to be contacted via email – how to make it work?
If you run the script from cron, you can look into using cron’s MAILTO&#x3D; option. You put a MAILTO&#x3D;you@example.org line in your crontab, and, when a job fails, cron will send a notification to the specified address using system’s MTA. OK, then, what MTA to use?

2. Socialite:
This packages offered in Laravel 5.0, socialite implements an easy and clear authentication tool for sites like GitHub, Bitbucket, Facebook, and Google. Envoy uses syntax templates to Artisans commands, simply setup tasks for deployment, and many more.
3. Horizon:
Packages control the system as it presents the code-driven configuration and elegant dashboard. The primary goal of the Horizon is to have look at Job output, time is taken to perform the job, and track the job details like job crashes. 
4. Passport:
Package used for validation of user by API applying the OAuth server. And we know that API doesn’t support the HTTP session.  Its practices the validation of the user.

  - job_name: &#x27;prometheus&#x27;

    # metrics_path defaults to &#x27;/metrics&#x27;
    # scheme defaults to &#x27;http&#x27;.

    scrape_interval: 5s
    metrics_path: /metrics

    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - :9100

This is a good starting place for a monitoring system for Linux boxes
Running the services in docker is also advised as it simplifies the rollout.
Docker node exporter:
sudo docker run --restart always -d --net&#x3D;&quot;host&quot; --pid&#x3D;&quot;host&quot;  -v &quot;/:/host:ro,rslave&quot;  prom/node-exporter:latest  --path.rootfs&#x3D;/host

Docker prometheus:
sudo docker service create --replicas 1 --name dockerprometheus     --mount type&#x3D;bind,source&#x3D;/home/ubuntu/prometheus/prometheus.yml,destination&#x3D;/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml     --publish published&#x3D;9090,target&#x3D;9090,protocol&#x3D;tcp     prom/prometheus

When you get around to making panels in Grafana, these queries are very useful:
100 - ((node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint&#x3D;&quot;/&quot;,fstype!&#x3D;&quot;rootfs&quot;} * 100) /            node_filesystem_size_bytes{mountpoint&#x3D;&quot;/&quot;,fstype!&#x3D;&quot;rootfs&quot;})

node_filesystem_avail_bytes


OR you could just setup a template for Node Exporter:

Enter 405 for the Grafana ID.

Pick up the name and choose a Data Source for the dashboard.

To make an alert, start a NEW dashboard and NEW panel. Template dashboards like above will not work. 
Enter the query for the item you want to track and press the Alert tab.
That should do it for a basic monitoring service.</span>

When using the Command Line Interface, we often find a few long and / or confusing commands. And this post intends to ease the pain of getting along with that.
When things start to get complicated, there are some things that can be done. In this post, we are talking about three of them:
Aliases
Functions
Comments
An alias is exactly what it means: a nickname. It is very useful when running commands that take too much arguments. For example:
alias lah&#x3D;ls -ltrah

Now, when running the lah command, it will be exactly like running ls -ltrah.
A function is probably the best way to run a group of commands. When adding a if or a for statement, it gets even more interesting. Let&#x27;s suppose we want to connect to a server which is still being provisioned or rebooted:

One thing i spotted when i started using Tech Twitter was people would post screenshots of there system specifications in terminals with pretty logos etc and i wanted to know how it was all done!...... its actually SUPER simple.
NeoFetch is a free, easy to install application which gathers system information and prints it to the terminal in a &quot;pretty way&quot;. It pulls together all of your system information and strips out the crap and displays it in a way that doesnt hurt the brain....
Installing NeoFetch is as easy as typing the following two commands....
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dawidd0811/neofetch


and
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install neofetch


this add the official NeoFetch PPA to your ubuntu installation and means you will always get the most up to date version.
after that simply type neofetch in your terminal and you will get a screenshot like below.

Another app you can use is screenfetch which does near enough the exact same thing!.
Install it with the following command:
sudo apt install screenfetch


and then just type screenfetch in your terminal to get your system specs like below.

Well thats going to do it today hope this quick blog post will be of interest and help you out. as a side note you can also get Screenfetch for MacOS.

                    <span>Docker es un software de código abierto que automatiza el despliegue de aplicaciones con el uso de contenedores. Esto hace que sea más fácil empaquetar y aislar el  software para que  pueda implementarse más tarde en otro entorno. Todo esto proporcionando una API muy fácil de usar.
Podrá surgir la duda &quot;¿Qué es un contenedor?&quot; en algunos. Un contenedor es la unidad  de software estándar que encapsula el código y todas sus dependencias para que una aplicación se ejecute de manera eficiente y sólida independientemente del entorno en el que se implemente.
Las instrucciones para crear el contenedor son llamadas &quot;imagen&quot;. Esta imagen se puede compartir, y podrá replicar con totalidad el contenedor original en cualquier sitio donde se despliegue. Dentro de estas instrucciones se encuentra el cód…</span>

                    <span>I bet that everyone here has heard about Linux. However, only a few can use it because their hardware doesn&#x27;t work with Linux.
In my case, I want to use Ubuntu 21.10 on my laptop, Acer Swift 5 - SF514-52T, but I can&#x27;t because there&#x27;s no sound coming out of the HDMI port. I have filed this issue here.
I also can&#x27;t connect my Bluetooth headset, Sony WH-CH710N, at all. The headset paired successfully but it just won&#x27;t connect. I believe that this could be solved using the method provided here but I didn&#x27;t have a chance to try it yet.
In fact, I had tried to run Linux on this laptop since Ubuntu 19.04 came out but fail because the integrated mic didn&#x27;t work at all. Fortunately, this issue is fixed on Ubuntu 21.10.
Nevertheless, the sound system on Linux is a mess...
Linux will not succeed in the desktop market unless it works on most laptops considering that laptops already sell nearly 3 times more than PCs.
Hey, Linux, see you again in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, KDE neon, or SteamOS 3.0!</span>

                    <span>In the last few weeks, I&#x27;ve finally wrangled my head around Docker a bit. 
As a demo, I&#x27;ve built a docker container for kiterunner.
Kiterunner is an API-fuzzing tool, very useful for bug bounty hunters and pen-testers. Shoutouts to @insiderphd for introducing me to the tool. I should have watched that video sooner!
Like any good tool, it requires some installation stuff beforehand.
I realized this is a good opportunity to begin integrating Docker into my workflow in a potentially useful way.
To quickly get Docker installed on debian or ubuntu:
# Install Docker
sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

                    <span>Today we released the latest edition of our Monster project. Monster is a collection of javascript classes that we need for daily work in our web projects.
Besides small helper functions and classes it also provides useful functions to enable reactive programming.
Monster is available via jsdelivr and npm.
Only the changes are described here. The full functionality can be found in the documentation.
We have added a new class to handle resources. Resources are external content such as scripts, data, or stylesheets.
These classes are usually used by the ResourceManager.
The class takes care of creating the tags and monitors the load event.
With the new class RessourceManager scripts, styles and data can be included in an HTML page simply by specifying the URL.

                    <span>Proyectos como Plant vs Undead, Decentraland, Sandbox, Crypto Cars, Axie Infinity han sido el primer arcercamiento con el modelo Play to Earn. En este video vamos a ver que necesitas para crear tu juego que premie a los jugadores con tokens por jugar.





  
  
  Dependencias


Para este tutorial ocuparás NodeJs que recomiendo descargarlo en Linux via NVM , también necesitarás un URL de RPC te recomiendo usar INFURA, y finalmente Metamask con fondos de Rinkeby Testnet que puedes conseguir desde el Faucet.
Primero bajamos el proyecto Demo.
git clone https://github.com/FilosofiaCodigo/PlayToEarnDemo.git
cd PlayToEarnDemo/

Ahora instalamos las dependencias.
npm install

Antes de lanzar debemos agregar el archivo de configuración .env que puedes construir en base al arhivo de ejemplo .env.example.
Finalmente lanzamos.
npx truffle deploy --network rinkeby --reset

Primero ingresamos en la carpeta del backend e instalamos las dependencias.
cd backend
npm install

Luego crea un nuevo archivo .env pero esta vez en la carpeta /backend, este archivo contiene lo mismo que creamos en el paso 1.
También debes copypastear el archivo ./build/MyToken.json en ./backend/MyToken.json.
Finalmente edita acorde las variables CONTRACT_ADDRESS y BACKEND_WALLET_ADDRESS en ./backend/backend.js.
Ahora levantamos el servidor backend.
node backend.js

Para poder jugar en el frontend debemos lanzar la web del cliente. Para eso ingresamos en la carpeta del cliente e instalamos la única dependencia de manera global.
cd client
npm i -g lite-server

Igual como lo hicimos antes, debes copypastear el archivo ./build/MyToken.json esta vez en ./client/MyToken.json.
Una vez hecho esto lanzamos el juego.
lite-server

Recuerda agregar el contrato a metamask para observar cómo obtienes tokens por jugar.

                    <span>So recently I started learning Node.js and I was looking for some blogs that can help me get started with Node.js and I didn&#x27;t find any good blogs that give a brief introduction to Node.js So I thought why not write one.
In this article, we will look at:
Introducing Node.js
The Node architecture
How Node.js works
Installing Node.js
Your first Node.js program
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on Chrome&#x27;s V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
(Chrome&#x27;s V8 Engine is a fast Javascript to the machine-code compiler to load, optimize and run Javascript code which is written in C++)
Node is single-threaded, based on event-driven architecture, and non-blocking based on the I/O model.
Why we use Node.js ?

                    <span>👋 Hello everybody! I recently helped a friend who is very new to web development get started with creating an express REST API for the mobile application they are creating. I figured I would share how I created the base template I drafted in case it can help anyone else!
At the end of this, you will have a very minimal template for scaling up your node/express application. Everything will be in JavaScript, however I encourage you to instead consider learning/using TypeScript for the enhanced safety benefits and developer experience. Since this was for an absolute beginner, I omitted TypeScript.
The API we create will be a simple hello world example, however the larger point is to showcase how I typically structure these types of projects to allow for an organized way of scaling it up to s…</span>

                    <span>React Native with Socket.io


Let&#x27;s create a basic chat app using React Native as your frontend and socket as your backend
The formal definition is that socket enables real-time, bidirectional event-based communication between the client and the server. It consists of a Node.js server and JS Client
This basically means is that data is transported between server and client in realtime. 
item 1 On - on() listens for a ‘connection’ event and will run the provided function anytime this happens.
io.on(&quot;connection&quot;, (socket) &#x3D;&gt; {});
item 2 Emit - emit() to send a message to all the connected clients
io.emit(&quot;message&quot;, {message,sid,time,rid});




  
  
  Server Code with Socket


The server code is written on a node server using HTTP and express

Using socket.io-client connect the client to the server. The useRef hook is essential to reference the socket.</span>

                    <span>Hello 👋
I have been working on the NodeSecure project for almost three years now 😵. I have personally come a long way... At the beginning I didn&#x27;t know much about the field in which I started 🐤.
That&#x27;s why I thought that writing articles about &quot;some&quot; of the technical difficulties and the tools I used could be valuable 🚀.
I will try to make articles that focus on one aspect 🎯. Let&#x27;s get started 💃.
One of the first challenges I had to solve was how to get the dependency tree and all the information attached to the packages.
My first instinct was to work with the public API of the npm registry.
What I wanted to do has already been implemented in the package named pacote.
Note: Arborist did not exist yet. I will come back to this in a future article. The first versions of NodeSecure did …</span>

                    <span>What is Serverless?


We often hear about this term called Serverless in the software industry, but what does it mean? Sometimes people think that Serverless means there are no servers and their code is running in some quantum space, jokes aside! Serverless doesn&#x27;t mean that there are not servers it just means that the servers are being managed by the Hosting company, so in case of AWS (Amazon Web Services) if we use their Serverless technologies then it means that they are the one managing our servers.
In very simple terms managed servers means that all the tasks related to -
Scaling - Adding resources or servers according to the usage.
Backups - Taking backups on a daily, weekly or yearly basis.
Security - Adding different kinds of firewalls and anti DDOS and other security related stuff…</span>

import Button from &quot;@kenaz/button&quot;;

VS
const buttonModule &#x3D; await import(&quot;@kenaz/button&quot;);
const Button &#x3D; buttonModule.default;

Simple right? - The first imports the module statically at build-time, whereas the second imports the module dynamically at run-time. 
With the first code snippet, most ES bundler will include the button component in our final bundle. Whereas with the second snippet, our button could be split into a separate chunk. This could be an advantage when your page gets super duper complex with 1000 states, but the button is only needed in 1 of those states.
Now, can you tell the difference between these twos?

You may have found this article for several reasons. Maybe you just landed a big promotion to CISO/CSO or you’re looking to become one soon. You could have been a CISO or security lead for a while now and are looking for new ideas. Whatever brought you here, you will come away with a game plan for strengthening your information security program.
First and foremost, a CISO is an advocate for good information security practices within the business. Stating it like that makes it sound simple, but there are so many responsibilities and considerations that go into a complete information security program. Security considerations go far beyond just technical controls. The many domains of cyber security could be listed along with key components of each, but it’s much easier to provi…</span>

                    <span>Hello 👋
I have been working on the NodeSecure project for almost three years now 😵. I have personally come a long way... At the beginning I didn&#x27;t know much about the field in which I started 🐤.
That&#x27;s why I thought that writing articles about &quot;some&quot; of the technical difficulties and the tools I used could be valuable 🚀.
I will try to make articles that focus on one aspect 🎯. Let&#x27;s get started 💃.
One of the first challenges I had to solve was how to get the dependency tree and all the information attached to the packages.
My first instinct was to work with the public API of the npm registry.
What I wanted to do has already been implemented in the package named pacote.
Note: Arborist did not exist yet. I will come back to this in a future article. The first versions of NodeSecure did …</span>

                    <span>In most CRUD operations and REST APIs, primary keys are used to reference models that you want to access or modify. A majority of APIs will take an ID as a parameter in a route:
GET /api/v1/posts/:id

// Return the Post resource with an ID of 457
GET /api/v1/posts/457

While it&#x27;s the simplest and most effective way of specifying the model to use, we often don&#x27;t want to show these IDs to the user. By displaying primary keys, you give users the ability to estimate the number of rows in your tables. If authorization isn&#x27;t effective or routes aren&#x27;t protected, users could input random numbers to access information that they otherwise shouldn&#x27;t have.
Using obfuscated IDs can be useful in social media or feed contexts, where the content isn&#x27;t used in the URL, but you want something less signific…</span>

                    <span>Helloooo, in this post I&#x27;ll show you how you can use vuex with TypeScript and class-components.
In this tutorial I will be using:
Vue 2
Vuex ^3.6.2
TypeScript 4.5

Now let&#x27;s start coding! First we have to create our Vue.js app. To do that run:
vue create vuex-counter

and make sure you include Vuex, TypeScript and Use class components in your options.




Let&#x27;s now create the Vuex store. The store will consist of a singular state which will contain the main count from where we&#x27;ll derive the incremented and decremented ones.
src/store/index.ts
import Vue from &quot;vue&quot;;
import Vuex from &quot;vuex&quot;;

Vue.use(Vuex);

export default new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    count: 1,
  },
  getters: {},
  mutations: {},
  actions: {},
  modules: {},
});

  Why Rust?



As a Front-End developer, there is a lot you need to learn and keep up to date. One of the biggest changes coming to web development is  web3.0, if you are not living under a rock you have probably heard about it,  at least a little. With these changes coming to the web I decided to learn rust to make myself more valuable, this decision also comes after researching the kind of projects you could do. One of them is a compiler, which funny enough my favorite React framework Next uses. I am a big fan of Next and my goal is to understand how rust  made a framework that was already fast even faster.

                    <span>One distinctive difference between TypeScript and JavaScript is the difference in typing: JavaScript is dynamically typed, where the data type is determined at runtime, while TypeScript is statically typed, where the type is defined in advance.
While being able to type makes it easier to notice errors at compile time, there are many times when typing does not work. So, let&#x27;s practice typing!

The one on the official MUI&#x27;s Github repo featuring Next.js with TypeScript (my framework of choice) didn&#x27;t follow standard Next.js folder structure, as of this writing.
So I felt inclined to create one with the most basic features that I would use myself. The result is on my Github (link below).
Here&#x27;s a screenshot of the About page:

It features a standard folder structure as generated by create-next-app and the leanest usable ESLint + Prettier configs for linting/formatting.

This article can be used other than React as well, but I will focused on React ecosystem, so just skip the React part if you do other than React. 😉
So, today I am discussing how you can move from the Javascript world to the Typescript wonderland. But before that, there is one question you need to ask yourself first, &quot;Why do I need to use Typescript in the first place 🤔?&quot;
Honestly, Typescript might introduce a little bit more learning curve, and maybe a little bit more on syntax, with a trade of shorter and verbose syntax. Of course, there are more to just shorter and verbose.
So, the good of Typescript:
Moving from type loosed to typed variables and functions. Imagine the reason you didn&#x27;t get your desired output, just because of &quot;1+1&#x3D;11&quot;. Ridiculous, right?

TypeScript infers a type quite smoothly — it&#x27;s a number. This fact allows developers to not write such types everywhere. TypeScript takes care of it. By the way, where will be another type in case of const usage. Try it by yourself. I&#x27;m waiting for your explanation in the comments. This is a small interactive with a reader)

import Button from &quot;@kenaz/button&quot;;

VS
const buttonModule &#x3D; await import(&quot;@kenaz/button&quot;);
const Button &#x3D; buttonModule.default;

Simple right? - The first imports the module statically at build-time, whereas the second imports the module dynamically at run-time. 
With the first code snippet, most ES bundler will include the button component in our final bundle. Whereas with the second snippet, our button could be split into a separate chunk. This could be an advantage when your page gets super duper complex with 1000 states, but the button is only needed in 1 of those states.
Now, can you tell the difference between these twos?

However, going through the whole process of successfully deploying your website to a hosting platform somewhere may sound a bit too discouraging for some developers. 
And that’s where a developer platform like Netlify comes to the rescue. With the use of their free starter plan, you can have your own personal project running in just a few steps.
In this tutorial I’ll show you these steps:
Setting up the environment.
Creating a new project. In this example I’ll create a new Angular demo project, but you can choose any other of the popular frameworks.

                    <span>If you have a requirement to create Live date or True time digital clock not exactly like above animation but at least show you running time live. For this you have to know basic Linux Command, Shell syntax &amp; Manual of Date command.
So Let&#x27;s Accomplished the Task ! (bold text are command).
If you want to create a delay in program we always use sleep Command an if you want to echo-back the command we always use $(date). But if you have requirement to remove a new-line in terminal we have -n option in echo. or If you have some other requirement to do operations like New-line, Backspace &amp; Tabulation. Then we have a options called -e stand for Sequence and you have to pass a sequence Character in string
For Example :-
    echo -e &quot;Hello\nWorld&quot; &#x3D; To add a New-line.
    echo -e &quot;Hello\bWorld&quot; &#x3D; To Backspace a letter.
    echo -e &quot;Hello\tWorld&quot; &#x3D; To add a Tabulation.

After know this syntax we are able to create live running time Clock. So let&#x27;s begin .
echo $(date +%r) &#x3D; It will give the output of this date command format.
echo -e &quot;$(date +%r)\b\b\b\b\b\b&quot; &#x3D; It will backspace the output (if command not work use below one).
echo -n  -e &quot;$(date +%r)\b\b\b\b\b\b&quot; &#x3D; It will backspace the output (Why we have to do this you will know in a minute).
echo -n  -e &quot;$(date +%r)\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b&quot; &#x3D; It will backspace all the output of command.
echo -n  -e &quot;$(date +%r)$(sleep 1)\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b&quot; &#x3D; It will add 1s delay in command.
Now we have to add this thing in Loop. So it will keep on running .
While :
    &gt; do
    &gt; echo -n  -e &quot;&#x60;date +%r&#x60;&#x60;sleep 1&#x60;\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b&quot;
    &gt; done

Now you will see the magic here the command is keep on running (Tick Tock).
If you want to save this command for some project like when creating your own module that time this mite be useful for you, So select a command and copy and create a file you can give any name and past it and save the file. To execute this file you can use bash filename.</span>

                    <span>Like many others, I spend enough time in the shell that even small improvements can yield huge productivity gains. This post is an attempt to catalog several of quality-of-life enhancements I&#x27;ve made over recent months to my shell setup.
Like most folks I know, I began my command-line life with good &#x27;ol Bash and actually still do most of my shell scripting in Bash. Even if I eventually rewrite the command in another language, many of my tools begin life as a Bash script.
At some point, perhaps ~10 years ago, I was introduced to ZSH with the venerable Oh My ZSH framework. For me, this was a huge awakening because it taught me about how much shell improvements can impact your life. I gradually evolved my ZSH setup to use package managers like antigen and began to invest more in creature comf…</span>

I studied International Relations and right after that, at the beginning of my working days, I started as Logo designer, continued as a UI designer, then moved to front-end development and ultimately I ended up being a graphic artist for a board game company called Final Frontier Games. Obviously, zero coding at the current workplace. Although I really enjoy working my current job, I needed to find a way to keep this feeling of satisfaction when I&#x27;m coding.
During my spare time while working as a graphic artist, I&#x27;ve been tinkering and creating few side projects in Python / Django.

                    <span>Another month, another amazing XSS Challenge from Intigriti, made by Ivars Vids. My first solution for this was not the intended one, but I hope you guys somehow appreciate it. 🤗
In the end of the writeup, I am going to be presenting you the intended solution, which I just figured out with a few hours of challenge remaining.
When we access the page https://challenge-1121.intigriti.io/challenge/index.php, it&#x27;s possible to see that there is a list of security issues, as known as the 2021 edition of OWASP TOP 10. There is also a search bar from where it&#x27;s possible to look for specific vulnerabilities. Whatever we type into this input will appear with the s query parameter when submitted.

If we try to submit, for example, a s value like

No matter how reliable modern gadgets are, nobody can feel safe from unexpected loss of photos for various reasons. The situation can be especially nasty when you come back home only to find the memory cards containing your photos to be broken or damaged, which means that the images of your remarkable impressions are gone.
To make sure you never face this situation, take our advice before going on a long-awaited trip, especially if the photographs you expect to bring home are one of the main reasons behind the route you have finally chosen.

The container superblock contains a link to the element known as checkpoint. Such checkpoint refers to the preceding container superblock which stores the information on an older state of the file system.This way, several older states can be restored by analyzing the chain of the container superblock.
The structure of ApFS file system is that of a B-tree, where the root directory containing data is the leaves of such tree. All branch nodes only contain links to the following node until they reach the leaf nodes. This file system uses containers as storage cells, and such cells can contain multiple ApFS volumes.

                    <span>JavaScript has evolved quite a bit from its humble beginnings. Unfortunately, some of those advances have been difficult to take advantage of. Some require features not supported by all browsers, others require complicated tools. For my latest Mojolicious web app, I wanted to see how I could use Typescript with a minimum of fuss.
We&#x27;ll start from a simple Mojolicious::Lite app, created using mojo generate lite_app:
From there, we can install Typescript using Node. Since Typescript cannot bundle itself into a single file, we will also install Webpack:
npm install --save-dev typescript webpack webpack-cli ts-loader

After installation we can configure Typescript using its tsconfig.json file. We&#x27;ll use the public directory for our output, since this directory is served by Mojolicious.

                    <span>Recently I had to work with some automatically generated types whilst using GraphQL. This is a very extremely useful feature! However, it can be a little cumbersome to specifically reach different custom nested types from the requests without it being too verbose.
But, being a little creative with some native Typescript functions we can find a way to handle this exact use case!

Let’s take for example this generated type (For the sake of the example, this will be a fairly simple type with a nested subtype):
If we wanted to extract the type of the array without it getting too verbose we could use some conditional typing from Typescript.

The following type allows us to extract it:
It can be a little confusing at first glance but let’s break down every portion. First, we have our ArrayElement which is a generic receiving the array itself as T.
Here the infer keyword from typescript (which must be used with extends) to declaratively introduce a new generic type U based on the given array.
Now let’s assume that the TStuff type is an array and we want to extract a singular TStuff. We could then supply the type of TStuff[] to ArrayElement
type TNestedStuff &#x3D; ArrayElement;

Looking at the result of the extracted type we can now use it however we wish or even assign it as its own type to make it less verbose!

Here is the code sandbox to play around with the type and the Typescript documentation :
