                    <span>If you are familiar with Angular, you might already know how to use ng update, ng add or ng generate. Every time you execute those commands, a so-called schematic gets executed.
Schematics are a great way to save developers hours of work on reading migration guides or copying boilerplate code from one place to another. On top of that, they are a great way to ship best practices.
So, how do we write our schematics now? Unfortunately, it is not yet as easy as you might think. You can create a blank schematics project like this:
npm install -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli
schematics blank hello-world

The schematics-cli creates a pre-configured project for you with a ready-to-use ng generate schematic. Everything from that point on needs to be done manually and leaves a lot of open question‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>I recently joined a team working on an Angular project (more about that later) but also had to deal with trying to find a place to live. Yes, at the moment, I am a nomad who decided I would travel to different cities before I settle down somewhere later in the summer. 
I recently had that feeling of having worked placed so much effort in learning something and finally have the opportunity to use this newly acquired skill. In my case, I was finally getting the hang of using NGRX for state management on an angular application until I realized that all of the state in the application I was working on was using Services and RXJS ü§Ø. 
And because I very well understood how to use NGRX, it was compelling to see how others had implemented state management without the need for an external library. Needless to say, this was one place I needed to take a step back in order to be reminded that there&#x27;s always more than one way to tackle a hurdle or issue. 
As of now, I will have to delay my desire to have the ideal workstation, and learn how to develop in any space I environment as I travel to different places - and much of this will require a certain level of unlearning and establishing habits that help me become a better developer and person. I have taken to early morning runs/walks to break the monotony of my sun-light deprived room and bumped into this little gift:

I am using Azure CI build to build, test and deploy my Angular App.
We will use Azure Task PublishTestResults@2 to publish our angular test results to Azure Pipelines.
As of now Azure Task only supports below Test Result formats:
JUnit
NUnit

We will use JUnit format to publish Angular Test Result. Also just let you know that Azure The default option uses JUnit format to publish test results.

                    <span>So after a long break (caused by a combination of laziness and actually being busy), I&#x27;m attempting to get back into creating more video content.
In this video, I&#x27;m using Bicep to deploy Azure Data Factory! Bicep is Domain Specific Language for deploying resources to Azure and is a HUGE improvement over ARM templates.




I&#x27;ve been trying to learn Bicep for my new job. Usually when it comes to Infrastructure code, I&#x27;d opt for Terraform since that&#x27;s the first IaC tool I learnt. In my new role, I&#x27;m using ARM a lot more.
To be honest, I never really liked ARM. Messing about with JSON files wasn&#x27;t my idea of fun, so when I first saw Bicep I was keen to give it a go.
I&#x27;m also planning to do more content with Azure Data Factory, so I&#x27;d thought it be good to make a video combining the two.
If you have any questions about the video, feel free to comment here or on YouTube.</span>

Let‚Äôs make sure we are all on the same page. The definition of DevOps that I love and subscribe to was coined by Donovan Brown at Microsoft.
DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.
This definition and the thought process behind it really drives how I was taught about DevOps and try to practice it today. DevOps is a culture or mindset that really should drive how value is delivered at an organization.

I&#x27;ve been a loyal CloudWatch user for years but only recently I stumbled upon the &quot;hidden&quot; CloudWatch Metric Filter Debugger. You can imagine the surprise on my face üò≤. This debugger is a hidden gem that helps write and test metric filter Patterns.
If you&#x27;re not familiar with CloudWatch Metric Filters:
Metric filters define the terms and patterns to look for in log data as it is sent to CloudWatch Logs. CloudWatch Logs uses these metric filters to turn log data into numerical CloudWatch metrics that you can graph or set an alarm on.
With a proper Metric Filter and alarm in place, you get notified whenever a particular message is logged to CloudWatch. The hardest part of the setup is writing the filter pattern itself. A correct pattern ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Any server or application needs some kind of logging system. It is common to skip logging in personal or practice project. But it is a must to have a fairly robust logging system in production ready servers and apps. 
Benefits of a logging system:
Logs are used by product managers and UX designers for planning &amp; design.
It helps marketers track performance of various features related to advertising campaigns.
It gives us the idea of how much traffic is the application getting.
Track errors, attacks and unsuccessful requests in production.
Morgan is a logging package for node.js. It can generate log files for all the traffic that comes to your server. It has some cool tricks to help us in both development and production. So let&#x27;s get started.

Create and setup a python development environment inside of docker in 5 minutes. (Also more or less a journal to myself of how to do this)
You will need to understand virtual environments with python. I will place the commands that are needed for setting up the virtual environment but will not expand upon them. 
Python 3.8 is the version I&#x27;ll be using in this tutorial.
fastapi
hypercorn
a few files will need to be created.
main.py
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
docker-compose.yml
The following commands will install and create the files you need.
mkdir -p ~/projects/myproject
cd ~/projects/myproject
touch main.py Dockerfile .dockerignore docker-compose.yml

Above we create the project directory and the initial files we&#x27;ll need for the app.

                    <span>Sharing my notes and thoughts about the AWS SysOps Administrator Associate Exam.
Before anything else, I&#x27;d like to say that it is extremely helpful to take the AWS Solutions Architect Associate Exam first before diving into the other two Associate exams (SysOps Associate and Developer). You&#x27;ll get a good sense of how each services of AWS functions and how they are used when building solutions.
Just like with any skills, it is essential to start with the essentials. Learn the theory, play around, break things, and fix them afterwards. When you have a good grasp on architecting solutions, you can move on to learning how to maintain them. This is where the SysOps Administrator Associate comes in.

If you are u are using Karma Test Runner then read my previous article Publishing Nx Monorepo Test Results in Azure CI Pipeline.

I am using Azure CI build to build, test and deploy my Angular App.
We will use Azure Task PublishTestResults@2 to publish our angular test results to Azure Pipelines.
As of now Azure Task only supports below Test Result formats:
JUnit
NUnit
VSTest
xUnit
cTest
We will use JUnit format to publish Angular Test Result. Also just let you know that Azure The default option uses JUnit format to publish test results.
When we run test in Angular App Test Results files are supposed to ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and NodeJS. MERN stack is one of the powerful and demandable stacks in Javascript.
Follow the steps below to become a MERN  developer:
Learn HTML &amp; CSS - HTML for markup and CSS for design.


Then you have to learn JavaScript - Javascript for dynamic functionality in web applications. If you learn Javascript you can develop the front end and back end also. 


After learning Javascript you should learn DOM - It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.


Start learning ReactJS: React is a front-end javascript library. 



Congratulation ! you are now a MERN stack developer. 
So, what after you have learned MERN stack development. Look you have learned only the basics now.  You can start making some small projects. Then gradually start learning advance and make intermediate project also Portfolio website.
Next post I will share some tools that need to know as a developer.</span>

                    <span>Any server or application needs some kind of logging system. It is common to skip logging in personal or practice project. But it is a must to have a fairly robust logging system in production ready servers and apps. 
Benefits of a logging system:
Logs are used by product managers and UX designers for planning &amp; design.
It helps marketers track performance of various features related to advertising campaigns.
It gives us the idea of how much traffic is the application getting.
Track errors, attacks and unsuccessful requests in production.
Morgan is a logging package for node.js. It can generate log files for all the traffic that comes to your server. It has some cool tricks to help us in both development and production. So let&#x27;s get started.

Morgan is an HTTP request logger middleware for node.js typically used for Express apps. Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalistic routing and middleware web framework for node. An Express app is literally a series of middleware function calls. However, before diving into Morgan, first we need to understand what are middleware functions.
An Express app is literally a series of middleware function calls.
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application&#x27;s request-response cycle (commonly denoted by a variable named next()).
Let&#x27;s take a look at these three function arguments:

                    <span>TL; DR Build your project and serve the dist folder from a server
Like me, you may have tried to deploy your React or Vue app to Glitch and failed :) but I found a way out. Thinking about it, your project build will consist of plain ol&#x27; JS, HTML and CSS files(and images). All you have to do is spin up a server to serve those files. 
npm run build

or whatever command you have set in your package.json file. This should spit out a dist folder containing your files in the root directory of your project.
Now, spinning up a server might seem like a lot of work, but with Express( a Node.js framework), it&#x27;s relatively easy. First, we have to install the Express package.
npm install express

Then create an app.js file and add the following lines of code.
const express &#x3D; require(&quot;express&quot;);
const path &#x3D; require(&quot;path&quot;);

const app &#x3D; express();

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, &quot;dist&quot;)));

app.use((req, res) &#x3D;&gt; {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, &quot;dist&quot;, &quot;index.html&quot;));
});

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, () &#x3D;&gt; {
  console.log(&quot;Server Started&quot;);
});

The code above sets up the server and sends your files whenever a request is made to the server.
To deploy to Glitch, simply log in, create a new project and import your code from Github. Glitch would handle the rest from there on out. However, if you want to watch how it progresses, you can click Tools &gt; Logs.

                    <span>Events handling and promises in particular are hands down the best JavaScript feature. You&#x27;re probably familiar with the concept itself, but in short, a Promise in JavaScript is a promise to call back with the result. 
Therefore, a promise can be constructed with two functions: one to be called on success and the other - in case of error. Here is a promise that would randomly fail or reject after one second:
const promise &#x3D; new Promise((resolve, reject) &#x3D;&gt; {
  setTimeout(() &#x3D;&gt; {
    const randomBool &#x3D; Math.random() &gt; 0.5;
    console.log(randomBool);
    // Return any value, or no value at all
    if (randomBool) resolve(&quot;I am resolved!&quot;);
    // Reject with an error, some value or nothing at all
    else reject(&quot;On no!&quot;);
  }, 1_000);
});

                    <span>Whats a Fuzzer?


A fuzzer now-days is a automated testing tool to find security bugs. It does so by generating many inputs to be executed until on of them crashes the target program. In other words the objective is to crash a program, but how can we guide the fuzzer in the right direction? 
AFL added to the objective a notion of code coverage: Any input that reaches an area in the code that was unreachable before is interesting. Even if it did not crash the program we can mutate that input to get even more coverage, we call this feedback. Over the past years coverage had proved to be a great feedback mechanism, but collecting it was not simple if one did not own the source code of the target binary.
AFL originally used compile time instrumentation to insert assembly instructions at the be‚Ä¶</span>

In this post I will explain how to exploit a vulnerability in an older version of a NodeJS library to enable RCE. Many concepts and technologies used will require an
intermmediate level of hands-on knowledge of cybersecurity
I will not explain every term. The entire process is quite simple. If you are unfamiliar with anything, try read it up. Everything mentioned is fairly common.
This Proof of Concept (POC) is a simple example of RCE. Good for demonstrating RCE to an audience without technical knowledge. I doubt it can be used in the wild for penetration testing or for any malicious purposes. In‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Trick is, use TWO password managers
First one is server-based BitWarden
Second one is file-based KeePassDX, with passphrase generator (actually, I tweaked this myself)
Then, use the passphrase generator in second password manager, BUT DON&#x27;t use it directly.
Instead, modify the passphrase, or make variations to your likings; so as to make more memorable and funny. (Then store all master password variations.)
I do have a question, though.
How long should MASTER password, that you type in (not copy) often, be?
Next step, is generating PINs, probably - this one is also highly reused.</span>

When starting with a new framework or super class such as Lit Element, Vue, React or angular, we find &quot;starter kits&quot; that have too much information that in principle is not useful or we do not know what certain files are for.
Today we have many configuration files which make Web development more complex but at the same time more robust.
The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis post is to introduce new developers to Lit with a fairly simple template that allows them to play with it locally and after playing with it for a while and you understand how everything works, you can start integrating more configurations to the project .

                    <span>Typescript is a superset of Javascript. It&#x27;s Javascript with type definitions and the code will be checked when compiling.
Why to adopt TS if ...
We can code fast with Javascript. The language is simple and allows us to do a lot of things. A prototyping time can be amazingly short. A downside of this is code readability. If we need to prototype something quickly to understand if the idea is viable, we skip thinking about architecture, writing documentation, tests. Eventually, we have a working piece. It has some bugs, but they can be fixed relatively fast. The piece is doing its intended job, we add more functionality to it, but some problems start to emerge.
To add a simple functionality, it&#x27;s hard to understand whether some service passes you an object with 20 fields, a string, or it may‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>The most common use cases for an enum are:
Keys and associated non-string values 
Keys, and string values that match the keys
Now, don&#x27;t read this wrong. I just don&#x27;t want to replicate everything that is written in the Typescript Handbook ( https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html )
The first one is adequately handled in Typescript. Just by using:
enum MyEnum {
  first,
  second,
  third
}

But the second case looks more like this:
enum MyStringEnum {
  first &#x3D; &#x27;first&#x27;,
  second &#x3D; &#x27;second&#x27;,
  third &#x3D; &#x27;third&#x27;
}

As the number of values  increase, it starts getting difficult to manage. And I see lot of boilerplate here. Also, there is scope for mistakes. For example, it is possible to get into this situation:
enum MyStringEnum {

How has been your week? I hope everyone had a great week. In todays tutorial let us go through Object Oriented Programming (OOP). 
Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects
Object programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.
The Object class represents one of JavaScript&#x27;s data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object() constructor or the object initializer / literal syntax.

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a drastic change in the lifestyle and habits of consumers. Spending more time indoors whether due to necessity or not has driven more consumers towards online shopping. E-commerce is taking over the market at a shocking rate. The e-commerce market penetration rate more than doubled during the first quarter of 2020, a feat that could have taken 10 years[1] if not for the Covid-19 outbreak. Out of those hundreds of thousands of e-commerce websites, Magento is the chosen CMS platform for almost 10%. Big brands like Nike, Coca Cola or Ford are good ambassadors for this content management system.
In comparison to other popular eCommerce platforms like WooCommerce or Shopify, Magento offers a strong advantage with its built-in security features.

                    <span>JavaScript‚Äôs creator, Brendan Eich, had no choice but to create the language very quickly (or other, worse technologies would have been adopted by Netscape). He borrowed from several programming languages: Java (syntax, primitive values versus objects),
JavaScript did not have exception handling until ECMAScript 3, which explains why the language so often automatically converts values and so often fails silently: it initially couldn‚Äôt throw exceptions.
On one hand, JavaScript has quirks and is missing quite a bit of functionality (blockscoped variables, modules, support for subclassing, etc.). On the other hand, it has several powerful features that allow you to work around these problems. In other languages, you learn language features. In JavaScript, you often learn patterns instead. Given its influences, it is no surprise that JavaScript enables a programming style that is a mixture of functional programming (higher-order functions; built-in map, reduce, etc.) and object-oriented programming (objects, inheritance).</span>

                    <span>Containerization of apps is a fast-growing practice as many companies are embracing the cloud and DevOps concepts. Docker packages an application, libraries, and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any server. Being that most applications do not run on one single component (even dinosaur apps ü¶ñ have frontend and backend components), we need a way to define and manage multi-container apps.
In this tutorial I will utilize Docker compose to get a blog up and running that consists of a Ghost Blog service and a MYSQL service; both services will use volumes for persistent storage. This tutorial assumes you have working knowledge of Docker and a server with Docker and Docker compose installed.

Compose is a file format for describing distributed Docker apps, and it‚Äôs a tool for managing them.
Ghost is a free and open source blogging platform written in Javascript.
1. SSH into the server and become root
ssh @PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS
sudo su -
Step 2 ‚Äî Create a Ghost Blog and MySQL service
2. Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root directory
vi docker-compose.yml
Add the following contents
version: &#x27;3&#x27;
services:
  ghost:
    image: ghost:1-alpine
    container_name: ghost-blog
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:2368
    environment:
      database__client: mysql
      database__connection__host: mysql
      database__connection__user: root
      database__connection__password: P4sSw0rd0!
      database__connection__database: ghost
    volumes:
      - ghost-volume:/var/lib/ghost
    depends_on:
      - mysql

  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    container_name: ghost-db
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: P4sSw0rd0!
    volumes:
      - mysql-volume:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  ghost-volume:
  mysql-volume:

3. docker-compose up -d
Congrats your blog is up and running! Validate via the public IP address of your Docker server.

                    <span>First up some basics
WSL2 with ubuntu 20.04
A lot of the logic in the scripts I write rely on bash&#x27;s if.. then.. else. The basic syntax of the statement is as follows:
 
    if [ {statement} {operator} {value} ]
[...] tells bash to evaluate the command and return 0 or 1 for the conditional expression inside the square brackets.
tldr; ensure things evaluate correctly.
&gt; is used to redirect the output of a command somewhere.
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$ cp file1 file2
   cp: cannot stat &#x27;file1&#x27;: No such file or directory
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$ cp file1 file2 &gt;&amp;- 2&gt;&amp;-
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$

$? returns the success of the previous command, 0 for success and &gt;&#x3D; 1 for failure. Lets look at the previous example and see what the output is.
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$ cp file1 file2 &gt;&amp;- 2&gt;&amp;-
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$ echo $?
   1

   #!/bin/bash
   cp file1 file2 &gt;&amp;- 2&gt;&amp;-
   if [&quot;$?&quot; &#x3D; &quot;1&quot; ]
   then
      touch file1
      cp file1 file2
   else
     echo &quot;File copied to file 2&quot; 
   fi


#!/bin/bash
# Check we have a parameter

if [ &quot;$1&quot; &#x3D; &quot;&quot; ]
then
   echo &quot;syntax: old {filename}&quot;
fi

# Copy the file as .old
newFileName&#x3D;&quot;$1.old&quot;
echo $newFileName
cp $1 $newFileName &gt;&amp;- 2&gt;&amp;-

if [ &quot;$?&quot; &#x3D; &quot;0&quot; ]
then
      echo &quot;File has aged and has had &#x27;.old&#x27; appended to it&quot;
      exit 0
else
     echo &quot;File has not been born yet or you do not have parental rights to the file.&quot;
     exit 1
fi

                    <span>In this article, we&#x27;ll explain how to install Dotnet Core on Ubuntu.
.NET Core is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications. Software developers often need to use the Dotnet core framework on the Linux system to test, run, and build the packages.
The notion of using Dotnet on Linux comes true through the new Dotnet core, which is an API based modular system of Microsoft‚Äôs Dotnet framework. But the Dotnet core doesn‚Äôt act as a single API; it functions as a shared or public library of API and codes.
Prerequisites
An Ubuntu installed system.
A root user access of normal user with administrative privileges.

                    <span>If you were using only CommonJS syntax you would &quot;solve&quot; this by using the NODE_PATH environment variable, but that won&#x27;t work with native ES modules. The good news is that we can still achieve our goal. The somewhat bad news is that you won&#x27;t be using the beloved import keyword. What I will show you now is how you can make your own require function that works with native ES modules.
Before I begin let me just say I do not encourage using non-local dependencies in &quot;production apps&quot;, or libraries or really anything that is meant to be deployed on a remote server. The use case I have for this is focused more on creating scripts for personal use.
With that out the way, lets go back to what&#x27;s important.

                    <span>I fear to even think of creating a new master password / PIN (without relying on variation play).
I mean, practically.
Passphrase?
How many words?
I don&#x27;t speak English, so which language? Non-ASCII scripts? Keyboard-layout-based? (Typing non-ASCII on QWERTY)
Does it need punctuations? How do you add them? How many?
Non-passphrase?
Next is, how long would it take to memorize it without tools / helpers? What helpers did you use?
Lastly, how many masters do you have? How closely they are related?
Related, also. How about numerical PINs?</span>

                    <span>Hello üëã
Today I&#x27;m writing to tell you about the future of NodeSecure üëÄ.
I have not been very active in the last few months because of my job which has taken up a lot of my time. But I&#x27;m back üòä.
Moving forward and updating the project has become much more complicated üòµ. So it was time to announce and make major changes.
NodeSecure is not only one tool anymore. The project is now a set of tools and packages that need to be maintained and extended. The project has also gained contributors on its way and many developers pushed me to go even further üöÄ.
That&#x27;s why I decided to gather these different projects in the same github organization (and same for npm with @nodesecure). It will also be easier to integrate new collaborators into the project.

Researchers Warn of Facefish Backdoor Spreading Linux Rootkits

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a drastic change in the lifestyle and habits of consumers. Spending more time indoors whether due to necessity or not has driven more consumers towards online shopping. E-commerce is taking over the market at a shocking rate. The e-commerce market penetration rate more than doubled during the first quarter of 2020, a feat that could have taken 10 years[1] if not for the Covid-19 outbreak. Out of those hundreds of thousands of e-commerce websites, Magento is the chosen CMS platform for almost 10%. Big brands like Nike, Coca Cola or Ford are good ambassadors for this content management system.
In comparison to other popular eCommerce platforms like WooCommerce or Shopify, Magento offers a strong advantage with its built-in security features.

                    <span>Generating certificates for your company or for development purpose can be challenging and a lot of solutions exist to provide easy setup and management of your certificates.
Eventually you also have CertsGenerator which does it in a very simple but nevertheless efficient manner: just create a json file with the appropriate configuration and let the application generate the certificates for you!
This application uses pyca under the hood , which is one of the main library for the Python language that manages x.509 certificates along with the cryptographic materials. As you may know, x.509 uses these materials to work with certificates and pyca handles under the hood all you need to safely do the job.
CertsGenerator acts as an interface between pyca, and the JSON configuration file in order to generate x.509 certificates:

this. Other examples are in these testing configuration files but you can adapt it depending on your needs.

                    <span>Em Tradu√ß√£o direta √© s√≥ uma autentica√ß√£o m√∫tua, logo as duas partes se autenticam. Mas antes de entender o Mtls, voc√™ tem que entender o TLS, ele √© a &quot;seguran√ßa da camada de transporte&quot;, ap√≥s isso fica mais f√°cil de entender o que √© o MTLS.

O TLS √© um padr√£o que segue o RFC 2246, na verdade com a mudan√ßa das vers√µes ele mudou de RFC, mas a RFC 8446 √© a mais recente. 
Uma observa√ß√£o, quem publica todos os RFCs, seja do jwt, jwe, TLS, e afins, √© a IETF | Internet Engineering Task Force (https://www.ietf.org/). Mas voltando... 
O TLS, ele usa criptogr√°fia sim√©trica, em palavras simpl√≥rias, a criptogr√°fia sim√©trica, s√£o ambos os lados compartilhando o mesmo segredo, e iso torna ela menos segura, se for compara a criptografia chave p√∫blica/privada. Por√©m, voc√™ ganha mais velocidade ao usar o modo sim√©trico, sabemos que existe esse grande impace VELOCIDADE x SEGURAN√áA.
 Por que n√£o se utiliza chave assim√©trica durante toda a comunica√ß√£o?
Este tipo de criptografia √© muito custoso em termos computacionais, devido √† quantidade de opera√ß√µes que s√£o realizadas.
Algoritmos mais famosos usados no TLS

Benchmarks dos Algoritmos:

E o intuito do TLS, √© substituir o SSL, j√° que  ele se tornou mais eficaz no quesito prote√ß√£o de acesso a sites.
Benchmarks com o TLS ativado e TLS desativado 

O TLS possui tr√™s subprotocolos que permitem √†s partes chegarem a um acordo sobre os par√¢metros de seguran√ßa que ser√£o utilizados na camada de registro para autentica√ß√£o, comunica√ß√£o e para reportar condi√ß√µes de erro entre as partes.
O sistema √© t√£o forte quanto mais forte for o mais fraco algoritmo de troca de chaves e autentica√ß√£o suportado pelo TLS, e somente algoritmos de criptografia dignos de confian√ßa dever ser usados. Chaves curtas s√≥ devem ser usadas se o valor do dado vale menos que o esfor√ßo necess√°rio para decript√°-lo.</span>

                    <span>The switch statements does not enforce exhaustive pattern matching (objective), the syntax is incredibly ugly (subjective) and is a poorly designed language feature (arguably objective). Thankfully, we can eliminate the shortcomings of the switch statement and improve the quality of our code using pattern matching instead.
There is a TC39 Stage 1 pattern matching proposal for the curious types here.
Say you have a string literal union type:
type Icon &#x3D; &quot;chart&quot; | &quot;file-check&quot; | &quot;paper-plane&quot; | &quot;users&quot;;

and you want to conditionally render the appropriate icon so your first approach is the old trusted switch statement:
const renderIcon &#x3D; (icon: Icon): JSX.Element &#x3D;&gt; {
  switch (icon) {

                    <span>Typescript unions can be very useful in a lot of cases. They can be used to implement algebraic data types when having a discriminator key. Without such a discriminator, they can be quite limiting. This guide describes merging an object union - another pattern that can be used to enhance type union usability.
TL;DR; This article shows you how to merge a type union (of objects) into a single object type. Find all the steps in the typescript playground here.
Suppose we have the following types:
type t1 &#x3D; {
  a: string;
  b: number;
  e?: string;
};

type t2 &#x3D; {
  a: string;
  c: number;

  d: string;
  b: string;

                    <span>Have you ever written code like this?
const result &#x3D; a || b;

It works pretty well until it doesn&#x27;t.
Using the logical OR to get a value or a fallback works 90% of the time you use it. But the other 10% are actually when you hit falsy values, which might otherwise be perfectly valid.
One point you can usually see such code at is the beginning of functions that don&#x27;t use default parameters, like seen here:
const myFunction &#x3D; (parameter) &#x3D;&gt; {
  const cleanedParameter &#x3D; parameter || &#x27;a default value&#x27;;
// ... more code ...
}

If you call it like this:
myFunction();

or like this:
myFunction(null);

it works perfectly fine.
But what if the following call was actually a valid one?
myFunction(&#x27;&#x27;);

Well, the empty string is a falsy value and will thus be replaced with the default value. And this is where you hit the 10% where the logical OR doesn&#x27;t help you anymore.
The nullish coalescing operator works nearly identical to the logical OR, but it only reacts to null and undefined. Instead of two pipes, you place two question marks, and it looks like below:
const result &#x3D; a ?? b;

If you now replace the logical OR in your function with the nullish coalescing operator like this:
const myFunction &#x3D; (parameter) &#x3D;&gt; {
  const cleanedParameter &#x3D; parameter ?? &#x27;a default value&#x27;;
// ... more code ...
}

making the same call with the empty string as before:
myFunction(&#x27;&#x27;);

will lead to the empty string being treated as a valid value again.
No matter what falsy value you pass from now on, be it the empty string, the number 0, or else, only null and undefined will be treated.

Indexa√ß√£o: √© poss√≠vel definir o conte√∫do que ser√° carregado a partir do servidor, sendo assim, este conte√∫do seria indexado nos motores de busca. 
Aparelho do usu√°rio: como a renderiza√ß√£o acontece do lado do servidor, ocorre uma menor exig√™ncia do dispositivo do usu√°rio.

                    <span>Hi guys! I am going to explain you to how to setup your local environment and workspace for create your first Angular application locally using Angular CLI tool. Simply following my steps finally, you can create Angular applications and configure application yourself. I am using my Windows pc to show you to understand the commands I used to create Angular application.
Step 01


Before create application there are some prerequisites.
1. You should be familiar with following.
JavaScript
HTML
CSS
TypeScript (Not required)
2. To install Angular on your local system, you must install following.
Node.js (Version: Current, Active LTS or Maintenance LTS) 
You can  download and install Node.js follow this  link. If you already installed Node.js you can run this command on terminal window.
node -v

                    <span>In this article I will show you how to dockerize an angular application using nginx server. If you would like more information about the nginx server  you can find it here: https://www.nginx.com/
To get started we create a dockerfile with two stages:
Stage 1
Copy the angular code from a local machine to a docker machine.
Copy the packages.json to install dependencies.
Install the angular-cli and npm dependencies.
Build an angular application.
For this stage we use a node machine image from the dockerhub https://hub.docker.com/_/node
Stage 2
Copy the angular dist folder from the previous docker machine named build on to the nginx location folder.
Then we use the default cmd that starts the nginx server. 
For this stage we will use a node machine from the dockerhub https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx
FROM node:12.7-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY / ./
COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install -g @angular/cli@10.0.4 &amp;&amp; \
    npm install &amp;&amp; \
    ng build
COPY . .

FROM nginx:1.17.1-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from&#x3D;build /app/dist/ui /usr/share/nginx/html

Once that is done, we will create the Dockerfile, and build the image to run it.
&gt; docker build -t  -f Dockerfile .

Now we can verify if the image is created by running the following command.
&gt; docker images

Now that we have created the image in order to run it we have two options:. 
docker-compose.yml file like this:
version: &#x27;3&#x27;
services:
    server:
        image: 
        ports:
            - &quot;80:80&quot;
        tty: true
        expose:
            - &quot;80&quot; 
        stdin_open: true
        environment:
            - MODE&#x3D;dev
        command: 

If we want to run a command when we run the image we can specify on command.
docker run -d -p 80:80  command

Hope you liked and also helps you in case you have to dockerize an angular app.</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>
