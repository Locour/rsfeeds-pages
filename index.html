Even there are many other links which provide same solution.
Now after this implementation, if I made check in code, if the meta tag is added then worked. Even, if I inspect in browser I can see the meta tag in script. 
But if I go to browser view source then it does not show, seems it is already rendered. So here I have 2 queries.

                    <span>What is DevSecOps?


DevOps is now the default approach to agile software development and deployment in most tech companies. With the promise of speed and quality, it seamlessly integrates the functions of development and operations teams to ensure that applications can be continuously pushed out to production. However, the emphasis on speed often comes at the cost of security. Critical vulnerabilities are addressed only late in development, with security patches often being tacked on right before deployment. This is where DevSecOps, also known as Secure DevOps, comes in.
Simply put, DevSecOps is the future of DevOps. DevSecOps involves integrating application security testing earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This notion of shifting security to the left is commonly cal…</span>

Stopping and starting a DB instance is faster than creating a DB snapshot, and then restoring the snapshot.

                    <span>Problem 1 - need move /var/lib/docker to large volume


Our local linux disk volume is under 30GB, so it will be quite challenge for our docker images, which take a lot of space under /var/lib/docker folder and quickly run out of space. 

It is possible to follow this artile - Use a Different Volume For Your Docker Images in Ubuntu that mount a new volume folder e.g. /dev/sda2 for /var/lib/docker and add the following line
/dev/sda2    /var/lib/docker    ext4    defaults    0    1

in /etc/fstab so the mount also happen during startup linux.
A quick tip to get volume type is using command df -T

What I did in fact follow this artile - How to move docker data directory to another loccation on Ubuntu
stop the docker daemon




$ sudo service docker stop

and make sure that docker is not running
$ ps faux | grep -i docker

make the folder and rsync the files




$ mkdir /mnt/docker
$ rsync -avxP /var/lib/docker/ /mnt/docker

Update docker configuration


Add a configuration file and tell the docker daemon what is the location of the data directory by creating a file called daemon.json under directory /etc/docker. the file should have the content:








{
    &quot;data-root&quot;:&quot;/mnt/docker&quot;
}

Update the docker service by editing /lib/systemd/system/docker.service
Find the following line




ExecStart&#x3D;/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --containerd&#x3D;/run/containerd/containerd.sock

and update to
ExecStart&#x3D;/usr/bin/dockerd -g /mnt/docker -H fd:// --containerd&#x3D;/run/containerd/containerd.sock

Re-start the docker daemon




sudo service docker start
# reload docker serivce configuration 
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

test by the following command after you pull an image




docker inspect image_id | grep WorkDir

The docker images under /mnt/docker are gone, e.g. /mnt/docker/overlay2 has no docker images that we pulled fromm DockerHub. 
See github discussion https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/36149
https://github.com/moby/sys/pull/62
No solution yet, keep looking! So far, have to re-pull the docker images.</span>

                    <span>In Brief


awk is a powerfull command line tool found included in all modern GNU/linux distributions. It is often excluded from beginner level Linux tutorials, where more fundamental commands like cd , pwd, ls etc are given more priority, and rightfully so. One must have a good grasp on the basic commmand line tools in order  to harness the full power of awk. 
awk in essence is a pattern scanning and processing language, emphasis on the language part because awk possesses functionality akin to most mainstream programming languages. 
awk loves tabulated data. So to begin with, you&#x27;ll need a piece of text represented as columns delimited by some common character. You see this pattern often in shells, for instance, the ls -l command that prints file information delimited by a space :
ls -l   …</span>

Docker is utilizing the iptables &quot;nat&quot; to resolve packets from and to its containers and &quot;filter&quot; for isolation purposes, by default docker creates some chains in your iptables setup:

API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface. The expansion of the term API may sound a bit complex initially. You may wonder what precisely the Application Programming Interface means? In layman terms, API is a service that allows two or more applications to talk to each other even when they don&#x27;t speak the same language. An API is an abstraction that allows a way to exchange data between applications written in any language.

I made this tutorial using TypeScript. But basically you can abstract the idea to your language of choose.
First, lets create an object to store our routes callbacks. The key of the object is a join of method + path and the value is the route callback. For example:
type RouteHandler &#x3D; (params: Record) &#x3D;&gt; void

const routes: Record &#x3D; {
  &#x27;get::/&#x27;: () &#x3D;&gt; console.log(&#x27;Get on /&#x27;),
  &#x27;post::/:id&#x27;: (params) &#x3D;&gt; console.log(&#x60;Post on /${params.id}&#x60;)
}

You can notice that the method and path are separated by a ::, this string was choose by me to be the separat…</span>

                    <span>With one of my projects ( rocketcrew.space A job board dedicated to the space industry ), I have to collect job offers on career pages of different companies. Every site is different, but each one can be scraped with one of three methods.
The first thing you have to look at when you want to scrape a website is the network tab of the browser dev tools.
Some websites are SSR, short for Server Side Rendered. It means that all the HTML page is generated on the backend. So what we want to scrape can be found directly in the HTML, we just have to parse it.
To do this you can use Axios to get the HTML page, and Cheerio to parse it.
Here is a simple example.
const response &#x3D; await axios.get(&#x60;https://website-url.com&#x60;);

const $ &#x3D; cheerio.load(response.data);
const description &#x3D; $(&#x27;#description&#x27;).html();

The last type of site you can encounter is a SPA ( Single Page Application ). In that case, the server only sends a basic HTML file and the rest of the site is generated with Javascript, client-side.
Here is a little example to get a page h1 text.
const browser &#x3D; await puppeteer.launch();
const page &#x3D; await browser.newPage();
await page.goto(&quot;https://website-url.com&quot;);

const pageTitle &#x3D; await page.evaluate(() &#x3D;&gt; document.querySelector(&quot;h1&quot;).textContent);

await browser.close();

CLI tools allow you to run certain tasks or operations right from your terminal or command line prompt. As a developer , chances are you spend most of your time in your terminal, typing in commands to help you get around some tasks. A good example of commonly used applications include npm , Create React App , Vue CLI etc.
First , create a directory that will hold the CLI application:
    mkdir todo-list-cli
    cd todo-list-cli

Next, we will initialize our Node.js project
    npm init -y

This will create a package.json file with defaults. Once that is done you need to install some packages that will help create our CLI application. These are:

                    <span>Ahoy there Sweetlings! Let&#x27;s send some emails! But in a SUPER FUN Way!! For a Sweeter fun, let&#x27;s add TypeScript as well! Even if you don&#x27;t know it, don&#x27;t worry, we will be going from Level 0!! As long as you know the basics for JavaScript, hop on!
Create a folder and open it in your favorite editor (mine VS Code). Then type this command on your project terminal
npm init -y

(It&#x27;ll create a package.json file to track all the packages that you&#x27;d download and so on)
For those who are a bit lost on how to set up the environment and run the TypeScript files, check this one out TypeScript SETUP by SilvenLEAF
Well anyway, in short (for details, checkout the above link)

                    <span>Ahoy there! Let&#x27;s set up the environment for playing with TypeScript and learn how to run those TypeScript files! 
First let&#x27;s install TypeScript globally if you don&#x27;t have it yet.
npm i -g typescript

(By the way, &quot;npm i X&quot; is the short-hand for &quot;npm install X&quot;)
Now, let&#x27;s create your project folder and open it in your beloved editor (mine VS Code)
Let&#x27;s init the tsconfig file, type the following command
tsc --init

(This &quot;tsc&quot; command will only work if you have typescript globally installed)
It&#x27;ll create a &quot;tsconfig.json&quot; file. Now, what does it do you ask? TypeScript is the superset of JavaScript and how we want to compile it will be defined by this tsconfig file. The best part is, it&#x27;ll give you linting (the red lines whenever there is an error in your code or logic) and also explicitly tell you what mistakes you are doing and in some cases possible solutions as well. Amazing right?
Now you created a TypeScript file, wrote your code, for example an app.ts file with this content
console.log(&#x27;Hello there TypeScript! You are AMAIZING!!&#x27;)

Now how to run this file? If it were a JavaScript file, like app.js, you might run &quot;node app.js&quot; or &quot;nodemon app.js&quot;, right? So let&#x27;s find the TypeScript versions for those!
Let&#x27;s install the packages
npm i ts-node ts-node-dev

&quot;ts-node&quot; is the TypeScript version for &quot;node&quot; and &quot;ts-node-dev&quot; is the TypeScript version for &quot;nodemon&quot;. So to run the TypeScript file use either of these commands
ts-node app.ts

(Which is basically &quot;node app.js&quot;)
ts-node-dev app.ts

(Which is basically &quot;nodemon app.js&quot;)
YIPPIE!! You just set up the environment for coding in TypeScript and also learnt how to run those FILES!! YOOOHOOOO!!! But now what?

                    <span>Any starter node.js enthusiastic would at least one time ponder, how can a single thread system out perform better than a MultiThreaded system.
And specially many people from multithreaded pardigm, who are evaluating/understading node.js,  would rather find it hard to understand : why Node.js(or any single threaded non blocking JS system) is acclaimed better than multi-threaded system (At least for serving web-traffic!)?
Node.JS is not faster (doesnot means its slower either), but rather highly efficient in handling a single thread, as compared to a blocking multi-threaded system handling its single thread!
I have made diagrams to explain this statement with analogies.


A multi-threaded blocking system is not capable of utilizing its threads power to its full potential, as a thread is blocked until it evaluates each line of code.
Now offcourse one can build a non blockig system on top of a blocking multi-threaded system (thats what Node.js is under the hood), but its very complex. And you have to do it ever where you need non blocking code in your application or program.
Javascript ecosystem (like nodejs) provide this out of the box as its syntax. The JS language sytanx provide all this feature where ever needed. Morever as its part of its syntax, the reader of the code immeditetly knows that where code is blocking and where its non-blocking.
The blocking part of multithreaded-blocking system makes it less efficient. The thread which is blocked cannot be used for anything else, while its waiting for response.
While a non-blocking single threaded system makes best use of its single thread system.
And hence node.js if used properly can out perform many multi-threaded systems.</span>

The best way to increase functionality is through APIs; i.e. email contact forms, processing of outside data, or present information like the weather forecast, flight schedules, currency exchange rates etc. How would we make these API integrations quickly and securely if we do not want to build out a backend or add infrastructure to handle these API calls? Where do we secure the private API keys? What if we don&#x27;t want user authentication prior to allowing our users to interact with the 3rd party APIs?

You can use Auth0 to create and maintain your own user store while also providing a secure authentication system on top of it. Auth0 lets you store users in your own database. Furthermore, Auth0 uses OAuth 2.0 as an authorization framework with which you can be confident in terms of security. Using a custom database as a user store in Auth0 facilitates user migration and adds an OAuth and OpenID Connect layer to your existing user database. You can configure any database or web service, including ASP.NET Membership Provider, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, as an Auth0 custom database. In this article, you will learn how to set up PostgreSQL as a custom database for Auth0.

                    <span>Validating user identity is incredibly important in mobile applications. The most common approaches to this are social login or, as seen with apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Line, WeChat and many more, the mobile phone number. Using a mobile phone number as a unique identifier on a mobile application, verified via an SMS PIN code, makes logical sense. Unfortunately, there are flaws with SMS-based verification that result in poor UX such as long waits, failed delivery, and the risk of SIM Swap attacks.
The solution? Authentication based on the SIM card, which can confirm the ownership of a mobile phone number by verifying the possession of an active SIM with the same number. It also indicates when the SIM card associated with a phone number was last changed as a signal for SIM swap detecti…</span>

I made this tutorial using TypeScript. But basically you can abstract the idea to your language of choose.
First, lets create an object to store our routes callbacks. The key of the object is a join of method + path and the value is the route callback. For example:
type RouteHandler &#x3D; (params: Record) &#x3D;&gt; void

const routes: Record &#x3D; {
  &#x27;get::/&#x27;: () &#x3D;&gt; console.log(&#x27;Get on /&#x27;),

Typescript is a strongly typed programming language like Java or C and typescript compiles into javascript so that we can use it in our browser or other platforms.

Typescript provides a complete type system so that ide/text editors eg.vs code can give you better autocompletion on your whole project and increase your productivity.

I will divide this article into 3 parts! You can only follow the first if you need to add only typescript into your project!
For adding typescript we will need to add a loader and install some dependencies!
We will install ts-loader that will handling .ts file!
We need to add tsconfig.json (ts-loader will use it for transpiling ts file into js file).
After this we will remove all file in our src/ in order to add index.ts (expect html file).
We need to use ts-loader in our webpack config!

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve done any type validation in JavaScript, you&#x27;ve probably noticed that arrays don&#x27;t have their own type.
typeof [] &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;array&#x27;;
// false

typeof [];
// &#x27;object&#x27;

To check whether a variable is an array, you&#x27;d have to use Array.isArray:
Array.isArray([]);
// true

But why don&#x27;t arrays have their own type? What are the implications of arrays actually being objects?
In JavaScript, arrays are just special objects that use numerical keys and have their own methods.
Because of this, you can use methods from the Object class on arrays.
let a &#x3D; [1, 2, 3];

Object.keys(a);
// [ &#x27;0&#x27;, &#x27;1&#x27;, &#x27;2&#x27; ]

Object.values(a);
// [ 1, 2, 3 ]

As a result, there&#x27;s also no limitations for the types of values you can store in an array. Other languages, like Java, might require you to only store values of the…</span>

We all are aware with usage of await of a promise: it basically commands code to wait for a promise to resolve or reject..... but wait until upto when? Indefinitely actually!
The asyncronous source has full power to keep all resource on stack of an async process engaged on RAM, and developer seems to have no control on it, as async source can decide when should it resolve (or never resolve) a promise, there by engaging everything on RAM.
Consider this code:
let someReallyBigItemOnRAM &#x3D; getSomeBulkyValue();

I&#x27;m trying to make my videos quite short, about 10 minutes each (except for the first one), while putting as much content there as I can. Here is the full playlist.
This time we&#x27;ll do Appointments and a way to manage them in the admin panel. We&#x27;ll also talk about separation between models and DTOs and how hard it can be to work with datetimes.
Enjoy :)</span>

                    <span>Ahoy there Sweetlings! Let&#x27;s send some emails! But in a SUPER FUN Way!! For a Sweeter fun, let&#x27;s add TypeScript as well! Even if you don&#x27;t know it, don&#x27;t worry, we will be going from Level 0!! As long as you know the basics for JavaScript, hop on!
Create a folder and open it in your favorite editor (mine VS Code). Then type this command on your project terminal
npm init -y

(It&#x27;ll create a package.json file to track all the packages that you&#x27;d download and so on)
For those who are a bit lost on how to set up the environment and run the TypeScript files, check this one out TypeScript SETUP by SilvenLEAF
Well anyway, in short (for details, checkout the above link)

                    <span>Ahoy there! Let&#x27;s set up the environment for playing with TypeScript and learn how to run those TypeScript files! 
First let&#x27;s install TypeScript globally if you don&#x27;t have it yet.
npm i -g typescript

(By the way, &quot;npm i X&quot; is the short-hand for &quot;npm install X&quot;)
Now, let&#x27;s create your project folder and open it in your beloved editor (mine VS Code)
Let&#x27;s init the tsconfig file, type the following command
tsc --init

(This &quot;tsc&quot; command will only work if you have typescript globally installed)
It&#x27;ll create a &quot;tsconfig.json&quot; file. Now, what does it do you ask? TypeScript is the superset of JavaScript and how we want to compile it will be defined by this tsconfig file. The best part is, it&#x27;ll give you linting (the red lines whenever there is an error in your code or logic) and also explicitly tell you what mistakes you are doing and in some cases possible solutions as well. Amazing right?
Now you created a TypeScript file, wrote your code, for example an app.ts file with this content
console.log(&#x27;Hello there TypeScript! You are AMAIZING!!&#x27;)

Now how to run this file? If it were a JavaScript file, like app.js, you might run &quot;node app.js&quot; or &quot;nodemon app.js&quot;, right? So let&#x27;s find the TypeScript versions for those!
Let&#x27;s install the packages
npm i ts-node ts-node-dev

&quot;ts-node&quot; is the TypeScript version for &quot;node&quot; and &quot;ts-node-dev&quot; is the TypeScript version for &quot;nodemon&quot;. So to run the TypeScript file use either of these commands
ts-node app.ts

(Which is basically &quot;node app.js&quot;)
ts-node-dev app.ts

(Which is basically &quot;nodemon app.js&quot;)
YIPPIE!! You just set up the environment for coding in TypeScript and also learnt how to run those FILES!! YOOOHOOOO!!! But now what?

The destroyAfterEach Angular testing module teardown option addresses several long-standing issues when using the Angular testbed:
The host element is not removed from the DOM until another component fixture is created
Component styles are never removed from the DOM
Application-wide services are never destroyed
Feature-level services using the any provider scope are never destroyed
Angular modules are never destroyed
Components are destroyed 1 time less than the number of tests
Component-level services are destroyed 1 time less than the number of tests
The two first issues have the biggest impact when using Karma which runs the component tests in a browser.

Overview of AngularJS

It is undoubtedly a largely used JavaScript framework that allows you to execute client web apps in browsers and create native apps. Angular apps consist of various components written with TypeScript or JavaScript. These are decorated with directives for handling things such as binding the HTML or markup to data. Your codes written with Angular will not run directly on web browsers. Therefore, you need compilers to change your code to something which the browsers can easily run.

It is currently supporting HTTP(S), HTTP/2. We are going to add as many protocols as possible. So, if you need to perform a load test for a specific protocol, please contact me.


Test plan creation can be achieved with a configuration(JSON) file. You don’t need to write any line of code.



As I said, our primary focus is creating a load test tool that can do anything related to load testing with the easiest usage. If you think current tools do not meet your requirements, please contact me so we can improve Ddosify based on your needs. ⚡

Here is a Portuguese version.
In my ongoing project, I have a CI/CD flow and one step is responsible to collect the code coverage and validate if I have the minimal value to proceed to another step.
However, even having 84% of code coverage, the SonarQube always returned 30% of the result in the step, because of that the deployment step was never executed. 
I spent some time understanding that the problem was in the Lombok annotations, the SonarQube was computing the generated code.
It&#x27;s simple to resolve this issue. I created a file named lombok.config inside the folder java (/../src/main/java/lombok.config) with this:
config.stopBubbling &#x3D; true
lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation &#x3D; true

The config.stopBubbling informs the Lombok that the folder where the file is the root and the Lombok don&#x27;t need to search for more parent folders.
While lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation  put in every generated code by Lombok annotation, another one named @lombok.Generated. This annotation informs Jacoco to not collect coverage from those codes.
Done, problem solved!

                    <span>This new Malware family is up to no good:






A very clever malware designed with 3 components: - trojanized applications, - backdoors, and - rootkits. 🐞
It employs a rootkit to conceal its presence and uses different command and control servers for each sample, maintaining a low profile on your system as if nothing is happening will it cause havoc.
It is designed to launch and mediate access to a local SSH server, update itself, and transmit collected credentials. 🔒
FontOnLake is capable of file manipulation, updating itself, and uploading and downloading files
It accepts remote connections, serves as a proxy and can download and run Python scripts, in addition to exfiltrating credentials.
Surprisingly, this malware targets the one who is immune to most viruses, Linux
And the most scary part is that, it is still under development (and it is this deadly ☠️)

Bir domain&#x27;e trust oluşturularak, domainler arası kullanıcılara, gruplara ve kaynaklara erişim sağlanabilir. Yani A domaininden B domainine trust oluşturulursa A domaini üzerindeki admin, B domaini kullanıcıları ve gruplarına erişebilir ve A domaini içerisindeki kaynakları kullanmaları için gerekli yetkileri bu kullanıcı ve gruplara sağlayabilir.
Her iki samba DC&#x27;nin de zaman ayarı doğru olmalıdır.
İlk olarak iki farklı domain&#x27;imiz olan turan.lab ile narut.lab domainlerinin ilk domain controller (DC)&#x27;ları üzerinde DNS ayarı yapılmalıdır ki birbirlerini görebilsinler. Bunun için /etc/samba/smb.conf dosyası düzenlenmelidir.

                    <span>There’s nothing like trying to deploy a minor site update and having your VM hang while SSHing 75% of the time, give up mid-build the other 25%, and then fall apart completely when you try to restart it. Since all I remember about setting up a Google Compute Engine Node instance in the first place is that it took me a while and wasn’t particularly intuitive, this seemed like a good opportunity to try a new host. I’m running a commercial Next.js site with a custom server so after browsing around DigitalOcean seemed like the best option.
And it was actually pretty painless!
Of course, it would be even quicker with a step-by-step guide so here’s a reference for my future self or anyone else who wants it. My guide for migrating a Node app to DigitalOcean (this may vary a little depending on yo…</span>

If we think that this library is a database, we can think of their organization method (alphabetical, category, author, etc...) as a database type. Database types are patterns and structures used to organize data.
The beginnings of database types go back to the early-60s, and through the years these technologies experienced an amazing development. Some of these historic types have served as the base to advanced database technologies, however, new types have been developed to solve new issues and requirements in modern DBMS. In 1969, relational databases were introduced. This database type worked with tables, having primary keys and foreign keys that connect each table. Like this, tables can org…</span>

Cross-Site Request Forgery (abbreviated as CSRF or XSRF) is an exploit which tricks a web application into sending a malicious request on behalf of an authenticated user. It is also known as one-click attack, session riding, hostile linking, or cross-site reference forgery. This allows an attacker to trick a web application into executing any actions of their choosing as if they were the authenticated user. 
Fundamentally, a CSRF attack relies on user&#x27;s identity on a given web application and the web application&#x27;s server&#x27;s trust in that identity. As the attacker does not receive the response of the malicious request, only requests with side effect …</span>

If you want to expose an API publicly on the Internet, authorization will be a requirement for you sooner or later. You want to verify that the client consuming the API has the appropriate permissions.
This guide is exactly about that. We&#x27;ll be securing an API written using Ruby On Rails, with Auth0 as the authorization server.
There&#x27;s a repository with the code so that you can follow along in Github.
I didn&#x27;t explain what I mean by securing an API yet. Essentially, we&#x27;re ensuring that protected routes are accessible only for the users with enough rights.

When I teach or lecture and mention security I always love the analogy of security as an Onion. This is a common cliché yet it’s still a powerful analogy for people who are new to the concepts. The equivalent analogy I would pick for remote debugging is like leaving your front door open with all your valuables piled in easy to spot and well labeled boxes.

The urge towards adopting microservices architecture has been a welcome trend in the software development industry.  Microservices architecture has been one of the most talked-about technologies in recent times – it has been embraced by many leading organizations worldwide. Originally developed to solve the limitations of monolithic systems, microservices architecture has seen a significant increase in popularity over the last several years, mainly due to increased scalability, flexibility, and performance.

AWS Access Keys are credentials used to authenticate to the AWS APIs.

Most applications require authentication for gaining access to restricted information or perform tasks. If adequate security is not in place, malicious users can circumvent the authentication process and gain access to these pages by simply skipping the login page and directly calling an internal page that is supposed to be accessed only after authentication has been performed. By directly browsing to the below listed pages without logging in, we are able to access and view its content without logging into the application.
Solution :
Implement session management to ensure that only users logged into the system and with
appropriate access levels are allowed access to the file.
Check for the AUTH token to ensure only proper users logged into the system.

                    <span>The Shopping List project is open source and you can find it on GitHub.
There, you are going to find instructions on how to build it and how to run it locally.
The frontend is written in Angular and the backend in Quarkus. The database is PostgreSQL. They are deployed as containers on Heroku and the HTTP communication is protected by JWT tokens.
I describe the technique used to deploy them as containers on Heroku in this article on medium.
You can access this demo version running on Heroku and try it right now. But as this is only a demo, please don&#x27;t use a real password there!
The application get dormant after some time without use, so the first access can take some extra time.

Shopping List is a web application that was created especially for mobile devices.
You&#x27;ll be able to organize the products you want to buy and do your shopping more quickly.
Once you create one account, you can create shopping lists and add products to them.
When you&#x27;re buying products at the market, you can check the products updating your list and switch from one shopping list to other very easily.
You can, for instance, create one shopping list for fruits, other for cleaning products and another for grocery. So, in the top menu, you will be able to switch between these shopping lists while you&#x27;re checking the products you already bought.

Application
API swagger
I used Angular Material and Angular Flex-Layout in this project.
On the Quarkus project I used Hibernate Panache to control the database and SmallRye JWT to protect the endpoints.
Perhaps you can find it interesting the Swagger-UI, created automatically by the SmallRye OpenAPI, that has the possibility of doing one Authentication to test the endpoints protected by JWT.
Thanks for reading this article and feel free to talk with me in case you got interested in this project!</span>

  Generic CRUD Model


Once we have walked about the theory of generics (Part 1) and we have understand the main CRUD methods (Part 2), now it&#x27;s time to see it in action.
Before start to implement the generic service of CRUD. We must define the generic model of all resources.
In this article, we assume that all models have some common properties like id, createdAt, and updatedAt.
Thus, we create a generic abstract class that contains all these common properties.

                    <span>Building your own blogging platform is no small feat. From picking the stack you want to use, along with CSS solutions, to how you&#x27;re going to organize your content are all the decisions that you have to make. I have gone down this path a few times with my own blog built with just Angular, and Angular and Scully, and hosted solutions like Dev.to. I continue to want something with low-friction so that I could get my thoughts out and be able to write blog posts more quickly about things that I&#x27;ve learned along the way or things that I&#x27;m tinkering with. This post is how I started on a different path, ended up rebuilding my blog and became an Astronaut 🚀.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s see how easy it is to add heatmaps to tables in Angular using Directives. We&#x27;ll go for a really simple and elegant solution to have separate heatmap colors to different columns in the table.
As I always say, Directives are a really powerful feature of Angular. It can be used as an elegant solution to implement a lot of cool functionalities. You can clearly see why the directive approach makes more sense when you reach the end of the post.
Even though it&#x27;s not that often we see heatmaps in tables, but heatmaps can really add some value in terms of visualization. It would make sense in data sets where there is some kind of comparison or range.

If you have this question in mind, here are some reasons which justify why creating a directive for implementing this feature will make sense.

                    <span>A Story Told Over and Over


I&#x27;ve been a part of a number of different Angular front end projects in the past years. In every one of those projects, there came a point in time where we were asked to implement:
When a call to the backend fails due to authentication errors (401), route the user to the login page.
It didn&#x27;t take long until another use case arrived:
When a call to the backend fails, alert the user of the failure with a generic &quot;The requested operation failed&quot;.
Soon after, another use case:
When the user tries to get the information of an existing contact, and the operation fails, display a toast &quot;Contact not found&quot;.
This would escalate further when the same operation failure would need a different error handling when done from different components. 
If the user tries to edit a…</span>

                    <span>Merhabalar, bugün benim de karşılaşmış olduğum ufak bir sorunun çözümünü sizlere sunacağım. Umarım faydalı olur.
Bu hata ile karşı karşılaşanlar genelde aşağıdaki iki komutu çalıştırdığında karşılaşmakta:
hostnamectl
timedatectl
Komutlar çalıştırıldığında ise aşağıdaki gibi bir output döndürmekteler.

Bu sorunu çözebilmek için öncelikle dbus adlı servisin çalıştığından emin olunmalıdır.
systemctl status dbus

Eğer bu komut sonrası dönüt aşağıdaki gibi ise servisin bulunmadığını söylemektedir.

Bu durumda aşağıdaki komut ile servis yüklenir:
apt install dbus

Sonrasında servis otomatik olarak active hale gelmiş olabilir. Yine de kesinlik kazandırmak için servisi başlatmalı ve &quot;enable&quot; hale getirmeliyiz. Böylelikle makine her başladığında çalışır duruma gelebilmektedir.
systemctl start dbus
systemctl enable dbus

Eğer &quot;systemctl status dbus&quot; komutunun dönütü aşağıdaki gibi ise servis bulunmakta fakat aktif olmadığı anlamına gelmektedir.

Servis aktif edilir:
systemctl start dbus

Böylelikle dbus servisi sorunu çözümlenmiş olur. Eğer bu işlemlere rağmen çözüm sağlanılmamış ise bunun sebebi /var/run ile /run arasındaki gerekli symbolic linkin bozulmuş olması olabilir. Bunun için aşağıdaki komutlar çalıştırılır ve servisin durumuna bakılır:
sudo rm /var/run -R
sudo ln -s /run /var
sudo reboot</span>

  1. Codec Options


Setting up codecs is the crucial part of encoding media assets. You will usually want to either keep source file’s encoding or apply a new encoder.
There are so many available codecs that ffmpeg supports. Below examples are some of the most popular combos that have been used in a number of different commercial projects.

Create new application




   ng new angular-ssr-docker

ng add @angular/material

Import indigo-pink theme to application. Add following line to styles.scss




@import &quot;~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css&quot;;

Create two components, Login and Home.

                    <span>I was playing around and testing some stuff in Linux when i suddenly did a tweak which changed how my WSL terminal opens up. This is what my terminal looks like - notice it doesn&#x27;t the distinct green + blue colors.

After some searching I found two articles (links at the bottom) which describes the &quot;sequence&quot; which Unix follows when reading files. As summary, here&#x27;s the files (in order):
/etc/profile
~/.bash_profile
~/.bash_login
4 ~/.profile
I added the function for .bashrc at the top of the .bash_profile:
## Loads .bashrc
if [[ -f ~/.bashrc ]] ; then
        . ~/.bashrc
fi

Closed terminal and reopened it 

Adding this great explanation from the reference link:
By default, Terminal starts the shell via /usr/bin/login, which makes the shell a login shell. On every platform (not just Mac OS X) bash does not use .bashrc for login shells (only /etc/profile and the first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile that exists and is readable). This is why &quot;put source ~/.bashrc in your .bash_profile&quot; is standard advice
Why doesn&#x27;t .bashrc run automatically?
How do I set up my shell execution PATH?

What is the difference between .bash_profile and .bashrc?</span>
