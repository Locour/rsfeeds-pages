                      <span>Hello everyone👋
In this article, I will try to explain the behaviour of the boolean data type of JavaScript.
We often use if statements in JavaScript to check if a value, that can be of any data type is true or false. But do you know that these values are not really true or false, rather they are considered as truthy or falsy values?
Let's understand this with an example.
var val = "blog";
if (val) {
  console.log(true);
}

So in the above code snippet, we declared a variable val which is storing a string …</span>

The first step across all the following options is to move your code into a separate Node.js project. This project will have its own package.json file.
Once you've moved your shared code into a separate project, link the project as a dependency using npm link.

One thing that I find daunting in today's web dev ecosystem is how to keep track of dependencies and plugin versions in all layers of our apps and, say, not miss a lot of versions for one tool or the other.

The core mechanism we use to achieve this are cookies. Cookies are small strings sent by a server to a client. After a client receives this string, it will repeat this in subsequent requests. We could store a 'user id' in a cookie, and for any future requests we'll know what user_id the client was.

                      <span>Hello 😄,
In this article I will demonstrate how to configure Kubernetes (minikube) to use OpenID Connect as an authentication strategy.
We will cover the Resource Owner Password flow. Feel free chose the right authentication flow depending on your application’s needs.
Please refer to this diagram in order to choose the flow:

Note that the Client Credentials flow is not supported by Kubernetes. According to the officials docs:
“To identify the user, the authenticator uses the id_token (not the access_token…</span>

Hello everybody! Welcome to this Introduction to Git and GitHub video series, where you will learn the basics of Git and start using it for your day-to-day tasks.
My name is Bobby and I've been working as a Linux system administrator for the past 7 years and a few months ago I wrote an opensource eBook on how to get started with Git and GitHub.

                      <span>Vim is a powerful text editor used by programmers and system administrators as a command line interface. Vim is widely used by Linux users. It is also available in Windows, Mac OS X and every other Unix system.
The reason why it is that popular is that vim allows the programmer to code efficiently without leaving the editor. When coding, you don't need to use your mouse. This sounds simple, but this is exactly what any programmer wants from an editor.
Most of its commands are robust and cryptic enough to be…</span>

That form has some required fields, like email and password.
Your "submit" button is disabled until the form is valid, by using &lt;button type="submit" [disabled]="myForm.invalid"&gt;, which you can find in many stackoverflow answers.
You're safe - the feature is working, a user isn't able to submit an invalid form.

Enums are used in most object-oriented programming languages like Java and C# and are now available in TypeScript too. They are one of the few features of TypeScript which isn’t a type-level extension of JavaScript. Enums allow you to define a set of named constants. Using them makes it easier to document intent or create a set of distinct cases. Today, we’ll explore the basics of TypeScript enums along with use cases, various enum types, and …</span>

Structured coursework and tutorials are a great way for most people to learn, especially at the beginning, but at some point you start to wonder... what does the actual work of development look like? How do you go from identifying a problem to a deployable project that solves that problem?

                      <span>Today, when you use React and functional components, you need hooks.
Work with hooks is easier than lifecycle methods in class components, but I've encountered some issues and today, I want to share my solutions with you.
I like to cut my code in small pieces for a better understanding. I make four blocks in reading's order. Usually, I use the same layout between functional and class components. In this article, I will only get into functional components.
The first block is for all the hooks and variables. …</span>

TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It introduces additional features like strict type binding (variables are bound to specific data types) to JavaScript and can also be compiled down to JavaScript as well.
TypeScript is an Open Source Project, and the source code for it is available on GitHub.

Longer answer:
Higher Order Functions. It is an application of JavaScript's ability to return functions from other functions.
We are replacing a function that takes n arguments with a set of n functions, which applied one by one gives exactly the same answer as original functions.
We can learn it by example right away. Btw it feels like this one is the most common one.

                      <span>Introduction


TypeScript language mainly uses structural typing. In structural typing, an element is considered to be compatible with another if, for each feature within the second element's type, a corresponding and identical feature exists in the first element's type. Sometimes this behavior may allow us to write erroneous code.
Let's imagine a function which calculates candy price based on their weight and price per unit:
// Create a type for our candy
type Candy = {

This article is suitable for new and prospective Rust programmers.
We begin, as most projects do, with Cargo - Rust's package manager. 
In the command line, Initialize a new project directory named get_input as shown below:
