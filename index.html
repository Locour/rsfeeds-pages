                    <span>Recently, I was working on a side project where I had to upload multiple files. It was a while back that I last worked on file uploads in Angular. So my first instict was to search for some resources on file uploads in Angular. As expected, I found a lot of them (e.g Angular 10 Multiple Image Upload with Preview Example, How to upload single or multiple files the easy way with FormData). I found these resources very helpful but they did not solve my problem completely, although they helped me reach a solution.
The task had a pretty straight-forward requirement.
User should be able to upload multiple images.
User should be able to view the images they uploaded.
User should be able to delete multiple uploaded images.

                    <span>TCP/IP is a connection-based protocol:
To start any communication a connection must be arranged.


Open a connection to start communications.


Close a connection to end communications. 


Meaning all communications between parties are arranged over a connection.


A connection is established before any data transmission begins.


Over TCP/IP, we&#x27;ll always need to establish a connection between clients and servers in order to enable communications. 



Moreover:
Deliveries over the connection are error-checked,
It&#x27;s really important that we continually monitor what connections are opened and closed.

Flake8 is a linter. It&#x27;s designed to find mistakes in your code that can later become bugs when your code is run.
A formatter arranges our code so that it&#x27;s more readable on the screen, but does not change what our code does. Black and isort are formatters.
Let&#x27;s install our linting and formatting tools. For a healthy coding environment use a virtual environment like venv or virtualenv (venv comes with Python).
Create a virtual environment and activate it.
# bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Let‚Äôs start exploring AWS API Gateway ‚Äì
What is API?
An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software.
What is API Gateway?

API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.
What are stages in API Gateway? How it is useful for API Gateway deployment? 
In API Gateway has different stages ‚Äì in which perform deployment of API‚Äôs and testing.
Each API is isolated to different stages.

I&#x27;ve also included the core concepts that one must know when you&#x27;re starting to dive into coding.
To start with, I want to say that you made the right choice opening this post. You might be someone who&#x27;s been dabbling with code since you were little or you could be someone who wandered around some interesting links in Google and you find yourself craving for more nuggets about programming.
Either way, you still have that one thought, or rather a question, in your mind: 

Is programming really easy?
Well, let&#x27;s clearly answer that question once and for all.
Programming is relatively easy.
Yes. For the most part, it&#x27;s actually just putting up keywords into perfect one-liners and then moving on to the next line, pretty much like when you&#x27;‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Hi friends!‚úåÔ∏è
In this article, I want to share a solution to the problem of forwarding http traffic through socks5 to rotate ip-addresses, this can be useful when parsing, testing or bypassing DNS / IP-based blocking.
SOCKS  is an Internet protocol that exchanges network packets between a client and server through a proxy server. SOCKS5 optionally provides authentication so only authorized users may access a server. Practically, a SOCKS server proxies TCP connections to an arbitrary IP address, and provides a means for UDP packets to be forwarded.
SOCKS performs at Layer 5 of the OSI model (the session layer, an intermediate layer between the presentation layer and the transport layer). A SOCKS server accepts incoming client connection on TCP port 1080, as defined in RFC 1928.

                    <span>Regardless of whether you work on the front-end or back-end, I think all developers should gain some proficiency in network troubleshooting. This is especially true if you find yourself gravitating towards lower level systems programming. 
The ability to troubleshoot the network and systems separates good developers from great developers. Great developers understand not just code abstraction, but understand the TCP/IP model:

Source: https://www.guru99.com/tcp-ip-model.html
If you are just getting into networking, here are some basic tools you should add to your toolbelt:
Perform a DNS query (e.g. dig or nslookup command)
Send an ICMP echo request to test end to end IP connectivity (i.e. ping command)
Analyze the various network hops (i.e. traceroute X.X.X.X)

                    <span>Dockerized applications and automated pipelines mean that you will eventually need a docker registry sooner or later.
It is essentially a place where you store Docker images organized in repositories. You can push images to the remote Docker registry and pull images where you want them.
Nifty service that Docker.com runs is Docker hub or a Docker Registry that has many things automated so you don&#x27;t have to bother with configuring it on your own server (which we will get to in a bit).
Free tier is also fairly generous at Docker hub because it provides you with unlimited public repositories and one private repository. More private repositories are available in paid tiers and you can find pricing info here: Docker Pricing

There are several docker images out there you can use, I made one (the source is on github at unixorn/docker-cupsd) because I wanted one that was multi-architecture - mine has AMD64, ARM7 and ARM64 all baked into the same image so you don&#x27;t have to change the image label based on what system you&#x27;re running it on.

                    <span>Home Assistant Printer Power Management


I&#x27;ve got an old HP laser printer in my basement. We barely print 10 pages a month between the two of us, so we only turn it on when we&#x27;re going to print. That&#x27;s a hassle though, because inevitably we forget to shut it off sometimes and it stays on overnight or even for days, and while it has a powersave mode, the 4050N is so old that even that burns a good amount of power.
Enter Home Assistant.
The watcher script and associated tooling all presume that we can send messages to a MQTT topic that HA is watching.
Your computers should be configured to print to the cupsd server instead of directly to the printer.
I run cupsd in a container on one of my Odroids. I could run it on the same Odroid HC2 that I run Home Assistant (HA) on, but there&#x27;s no compe‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>This is a simple instruction to help you override the Armbian&#x27;s setup utilities that require your password to be long and not a dictionary word.

Think of a disposable, long password and write it down in Notepad or other text editor
Use it as your new root password
Create a primary user account and use the same password for the account password.
Finish and exit the the setup utilities
Now, you should be able to enter commands using the user &quot;root&quot;. Use the following commands to change the password for &quot;root&quot; and your newly created user




passwd root
(Follow on screen instruction to type in your less secure password)

passwd your_newly_created_user
(Follow on screen instruction to type in your less secure password again)


There might be some debate on why you would want your password simple instead of using a complex one to improve security. 
In my case, I am setting up an environment on ZeroPi that try to match the Raspberry Pi OS in which it is easier for students to get started with Raspberry Pi&#x27;s teaching materials (And one of them is the default user &quot;pi&quot; with password &quot;raspberry&quot;). But in general if you are using this system yourself, I would recommend a more complex and secure password for root instead.</span>

                    <span>MERN Stack üöÇ


The MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack is very popular for making full stack applications, utilizing Javascript for both the backend and frontend as well as a document-oriented or non relational database (MongoDB), meaning that it&#x27;s structured like JSON rather than a large excel sheet like SQL databases are. 
This stack uses Express for the backend, and Express typically accompanies a view engine like Pug or EJS to render HTML dynamically. However, the MERN stack introduces a problem. React renders the frontend code with JSX, so you can&#x27;t use those view engines, and you instead need a new way to render backend data for the client. You might suggest using JSX as your backend view engine, but then you would be losing a lot of the functionality that React brings to t‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Trying to integrate with an E-commerce platform for a mobile app by sending PDF invoices through a node express app
So the idea was to fetch the PDF data and return it to the client
The url is not directly used in the client as the E-commerce app requires api-key which is only defined in the server app
const axios &#x3D; require(&#x27;axios&#x27;);
const url &#x3D; &quot;http://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf&quot;
axios.defaults.headers.common[&#x27;Authorization&#x27;] &#x3D; &quot;secret-key&quot;;

app.get(&#x27;/download&#x27;, async function(req, res) {
   try {
      // Fetch PDF from desired url
      const pdf &#x3D; await axios.get(url);

      // Set response header to pdf 
      res.setHeader(&#x27;Content-Type&#x27;, &#x27;application/pdf&#x27;);

      // Return PDF data to client
      return res.send(pdf.data);
    } catch (err) {

      // Throw if any error occurred
      return res.status(400).json(err);
    }
});

Testing this endpoint, a blank PDF document response was returned
Going through multiple forms and docs, trying different methods to achieve the same end result
Until I found the answer when I was just giving up where axios have a problem with requesting PDF
Where { responseType: &#x27;arraybuffer&#x27; } is provided to axios options api
      await axios.get(url,{responseType:&#x27;arraybuffer&#x27;});</span>

                    <span>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment and a very popular tool for building applications. It runs on V8 JavaScript engine which makes it highly performant. It was released in 2009 and since then it is getting more and more popular. One of the advantages is that it uses JavaScript programming language which means that the same programming language can be used for server-side and client-side applications. There are few popular frameworks which run on Node.js platform and most popular is Express. In this tutorial I am going to use Express framework.
A big positive change emerged when the TypeScript language was released. TypeScript is a language which builds on JavaScript and some of the advantages using TypeScript are:

In this post we will implement OTP based authentication and authorization where user can access secured api using their identity.
User will register their account 
User will login using mobile number 
User will get 6 digit OTP on provided mobile number
User will verify their OTP
On success verification user will get jwt token which they can send on further request as a identity
we will add admin role to user if their mobile number will match with env variable mobile number other wise by default they will be normal user

But I&#x27;ve recently started developing it again.
It seems that my passion for the market of person-to-person trading hasn&#x27;t been crushed yet.
Well, that&#x27;s not really the point...
A lot of code was stuck, and the Stripe area wasn&#x27;t working anymore.
What I&#x27;m trying to do is a C2C service that allows you to verify a user&#x27;s identity when transferring sales to their account.
I need to verify the identity of the user.
We need the address, the real name, the driver&#x27;s license and so on.
In this article, we&#x27;ll show you how to create an image of your driver&#x27;s license.

                    <span>Recently while reviewing a PR I realized a function was making multiple calls one by one which could have been making calls in parallel. In this post I want to share two different pieces of code (with mock) and a graph which shows how both of them progresses independently.
Let&#x27;s start!!
Suppose there is a scenario where we have to make multiple calls to an API to get the full list of users, suppose there are 500 users in system, but API is capped by maximum pageSize, which could be let&#x27;s suppose 100. 
With above assumptions we will have to make 10 calls to get the full list of users.
Let&#x27;s create a mock/fake API endpoint:
function fakeApiCall(currentPage) {
  return new Promise((resolve) &#x3D;&gt; {
    setTimeout(() &#x3D;&gt; {
      resolve({

A Collection Of Users which is consist of id, name and other stuff

                    <span>Hello how are you?
Before we start, sorry if you don&#x27;t understand English much, I&#x27;m from Argentina and I did this article with google translate.
I am one month away from starting a project in my company and it is a fairly large project that would receive hundreds of thousands of requests per minute.
We are deciding technologies, previously projects had been developed in Lumen and Java, this is not possible to migrate because it was not developed correctly and now the company wants to establish a stack of technologies in which all projects will be developed from here on.
In the last 2 weeks I have been researching and saw the following:
Laravel: Today it is not very common for PHP to be taught in schools and on the other hand it is a bit slow technology. Of course, the Octane package just came out and paints to exceed or at least reach the speed of the same web developed in Node. Meanwhile php is being less supported every day and despite the push it has been having with Laravel I think it will be left behind with the release of new Node frameworks.


AdonisJS: It is a Laravel in Node, but today it has almost no community, even though I read that its discord is very active.


NestJs: It is the most popular Node framework, I understand with which all kinds of rest apis can be developed. It also offers Fastify which is very convenient over Express due to support for asynchronous calls. I want to clarify that it is the one that investigates the least.




  
  
  The other part of the stack:


The idea would be to use ReactJS for Front and React Native for Mobile development.
I am also thinking of using InertiaJS or NextJS.
We are implementing Docker and Kubernetes.
My question is directed for you to comment without choosing sides, trying to be as impartial as possible.
What Technology Stack would you use?

So, if you are considering whether to connect to the public Wi-Fi network at the shopping mall, the airport, etc. beware of the potential risk to your device because hackers love public Wi-Fi!
The most effective trick to staying safe on public Wi-Fi is to use a VPN on your devices. Although virtual private networks are not infallible, they can protect your privacy.

                    <span>These days whenever we post a URL (Uniform Resource Locator / Link) on any social media site, it will be converted to a short URL with that specific site&#x27;s domain in it.
This is ok, because the shortened URL will reduce the number of characters in the post and also when you look at a post with a long URL (more than 25 characters in it), it will no look good.
But, we often receive messages over WhatsApp or other social media websites, sometimes even as SMS on our phone with short URLs in them, asking us to visit that URL to claim a gift or something else.
The main problem here will be that most of these short URLs will be created by using services which are free and you really cannot tell where you will be redirected by clicking on it.
There are a few websites and services which will tell you what is behind a short URL and where you will be redirected once you click on it.
One such service is ExpandURL - Link
First go to ExpandURL and there you will see a page like this,

Paste the short URL (which u received as a message) in the input text field and click on Expand URL
The service will check the short URL and will give you results of it. The results will be shown like this,

Results will include,
the number of redirects made from the short URL to the expanded URL (long URL)
Available Meta description, and keywords
Content-Type 
Whether the link appears to be safe or not (Google Safe Browsing)
This is only a way to check where the user will be redirected after clicking on the short URL and whether the URL is appearing to be safe or not.
After confirming that the URL is safe and clicking on it, you should also check the content on that website.
Sometimes, the URLs (long URL) of the phishing websites will also appear to be safe, ultimately it is us who should decide whether you can stay on that site or should leave immediately.</span>

                    <span>To quote Scott Hanselman &quot;Visual Studio Code Remote Development may change everything&quot;. They are a great way to build consistent development environments which can massively lower the friction for new people to contribute to a code base.
That said, they do create new paths to exploiting developer&#x27;s machines and devcontainers are often opaque to existing security scanning tooling. This post is not about a specific vulnerability in devcontainers but more what potential paths to exploitation devcontainers represent.
It is also becoming increasingly common for open source projects to include devcontainer configuration in their projects, acclimatising developers to running new forms of potentially untrusted code on their local machines.

                    <span>Shift cipher is the most basic and simple substitution cipher ever existed. It was used by numerous kings and common people in ancient times, because of its simplicity. It is also known as the Caesar cipher as he used a generalized form of it known as ROT-13. 
Shift cipher is nothing but substitution of letters to their left or right by some specific number of letters, and that number of letters will be known as the key of the cipher. Once the key is decided and the plaintext is encrypted to ciphertext, we can send the cipher text to whomever we want. If he/she will have the key, then he/she will easily decrypt the message and read it and can reply to that encrypting the message with the same key.

                    <span>A 12 year old Nirof along with some of her friends is playing the blind man&#x27;s buff in the community park. Nirof is blindfolded so she&#x27;d just run into anyone (friends and strangers). Since she can not free her eyes, there is simply no way she can tell who she catches hold of. Her friends while trying to save themselves would also run into people, they could however identify the people they do not know. What am I even saying? I will finish the story (not really a story) towards the end of the post. Before we delve into the real deal, let us try to understand something much important and way much easier to grasp. Let us talk about Enumerables and Iterables.

                    <span>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment and a very popular tool for building applications. It runs on V8 JavaScript engine which makes it highly performant. It was released in 2009 and since then it is getting more and more popular. One of the advantages is that it uses JavaScript programming language which means that the same programming language can be used for server-side and client-side applications. There are few popular frameworks which run on Node.js platform and most popular is Express. In this tutorial I am going to use Express framework.
A big positive change emerged when the TypeScript language was released. TypeScript is a language which builds on JavaScript and some of the advantages using TypeScript are:

                    <span>Hello guys,
Last week, I have developed ui-components.com.

I updated this website and added new 18 Ui components.
website: https://ui-components.com
https://github.com/YuikoIto/ui-components
The updates are as follows.
Added new 4 button components
Added new 2 input components
Created the Text Animation page and added new 4 text animation components
Created the Arrow page and added 4 arrow components
Created the Speech Bubble page and added 4 speech bubble components
Bug fixes
I added the following 4 buttons.

I added the following 2 inputs.

I added the following 4 text animations.

I&#x27;m using 5 span tags to separate this Hello characters, but I didn&#x27;t want to use for example &amp;:nth-child(1) and &amp;:nth-child(2)... Then I used @for.
This is really useful.
  @for $i from 1 through 5 {
    &amp;:nth-child(#{$i + 1}) {
      $delay: $i * 0.1 + s;
      animation-delay: $delay;
    }
  }

I added the following 4 arrows.

This is easy, but I think it&#x27;s a bit bothersome. So I added.
I added the following 4 speech bubbles.

The bug fixes is below.
When a modal was open, clicking anywhere would close the modal.
Before

You may want to copy a part of the code while the modal is open, but before updating, no matter where you click in the modal, it closes.
After

Then, I fixed.

                    <span>If you are familiar with Angular, you might already know how to use ng update, ng add or ng generate. Every time you execute those commands, a so-called schematic gets executed.
Schematics are a great way to save developers hours of work on reading migration guides or copying boilerplate code from one place to another. On top of that, they are a great way to ship best practices.
So, how do we write our schematics now? Unfortunately, it is not yet as easy as you might think. You can create a blank schematics project like this:
npm install -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli
schematics blank hello-world

The schematics-cli creates a pre-configured project for you with a ready-to-use ng generate schematic. Everything from that point on needs to be done manually and leaves a lot of open question‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>I recently joined a team working on an Angular project (more about that later) but also had to deal with trying to find a place to live. Yes, at the moment, I am a nomad who decided I would travel to different cities before I settle down somewhere later in the summer. 
I recently had that feeling of having worked placed so much effort in learning something and finally have the opportunity to use this newly acquired skill. In my case, I was finally getting the hang of using NGRX for state management on an angular application until I realized that all of the state in the application I was working on was using Services and RXJS ü§Ø. 
And because I very well understood how to use NGRX, it was compelling to see how others had implemented state management without the need for an external library. Needless to say, this was one place I needed to take a step back in order to be reminded that there&#x27;s always more than one way to tackle a hurdle or issue. 
As of now, I will have to delay my desire to have the ideal workstation, and learn how to develop in any space I environment as I travel to different places - and much of this will require a certain level of unlearning and establishing habits that help me become a better developer and person. I have taken to early morning runs/walks to break the monotony of my sun-light deprived room and bumped into this little gift:

                    <span>So after a long break (caused by a combination of laziness and actually being busy), I&#x27;m attempting to get back into creating more video content.
In this video, I&#x27;m using Bicep to deploy Azure Data Factory! Bicep is Domain Specific Language for deploying resources to Azure and is a HUGE improvement over ARM templates.




I&#x27;ve been trying to learn Bicep for my new job. Usually when it comes to Infrastructure code, I&#x27;d opt for Terraform since that&#x27;s the first IaC tool I learnt. In my new role, I&#x27;m using ARM a lot more.
To be honest, I never really liked ARM. Messing about with JSON files wasn&#x27;t my idea of fun, so when I first saw Bicep I was keen to give it a go.
I&#x27;m also planning to do more content with Azure Data Factory, so I&#x27;d thought it be good to make a video combining the two.

Let‚Äôs make sure we are all on the same page. The definition of DevOps that I love and subscribe to was coined by Donovan Brown at Microsoft.
DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.
This definition and the thought process behind it really drives how I was taught about DevOps and try to practice it today. DevOps is a culture or mindset that really should drive how value is delivered at an organization. DevOps should not be a Developer only or &quot;DevOps&quot; only activity, this mindset sho‚Ä¶</span>

I&#x27;ve been a loyal CloudWatch user for years but only recently I stumbled upon the &quot;hidden&quot; CloudWatch Metric Filter Debugger. You can imagine the surprise on my face üò≤. This debugger is a hidden gem that helps write and test metric filter Patterns.
If you&#x27;re not familiar with CloudWatch Metric Filters:
Metric filters define the terms and patterns to look for in log data as it is sent to CloudWatch Logs. CloudWatch Logs uses these metric filters to turn log data into numerical CloudWatch metrics that you can graph or set an alarm on.
With a proper Metric Filter and alarm in place, you get notified whenever a particular message is logged to CloudWatch. The hardest part of the setup is writing the filter pattern itself. A correct pattern ‚Ä¶</span>

Probably your package manager already has it. If it doesn&#x27;t, don&#x27;t worry, just clone the git repo and run the install script as directed here.
You can check if the installation has been successful by running the command whereis fzf. You should see the location of binary.

A fuzzer now-days is a automated testing tool to find security bugs. It does so by generating many inputs to be executed until on of them crashes the target program. In other words the objective is to crash a program, but how can we guide the fuzzer in the right direction? 
AFL added to the objective a notion of code coverage: Any input that reaches an area in the code that was unreachable before is interesting. Even if it did not crash the program we can mutate that input to get even more coverage, we call this feedback. Over the past years coverage had proved to be a great feedback mechanism, but collecting it was not simple if one did not own the source code of the target binary.

                    <span>Trick is, use TWO password managers
First one is server-based BitWarden
Second one is file-based KeePassDX, with passphrase generator (actually, I tweaked this myself)
Then, use the passphrase generator in second password manager, BUT DON&#x27;t use it directly.
Instead, modify the passphrase, or make variations to your likings; so as to make more memorable and funny. (Then store all master password variations.)
I do have a question, though.
How long should MASTER password, that you type in (not copy) often, be?
Next step, is generating PINs, probably - this one is also highly reused.</span>

When starting with a new framework or super class such as Lit Element, Vue, React or angular, we find &quot;starter kits&quot; that have too much information that in principle is not useful or we do not know what certain files are for.
Today we have many configuration files which make Web development more complex but at the same time more robust.

                    <span>Typescript is a superset of Javascript. It&#x27;s Javascript with type definitions and the code will be checked when compiling.
Why to adopt TS if ...
We can code fast with Javascript. The language is simple and allows us to do a lot of things. A prototyping time can be amazingly short. A downside of this is code readability. If we need to prototype something quickly to understand if the idea is viable, we skip thinking about architecture, writing documentation, tests. Eventually, we have a working piece. It has some bugs, but they can be fixed relatively fast. The piece is doing its intended job, we add more functionality to it, but some problems start to emerge.
To add a simple functionality, it&#x27;s hard to understand whether some service passes you an object with 20 fields, a string, or it may‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>The most common use cases for an enum are:
Keys and associated non-string values 
Keys, and string values that match the keys
Now, don&#x27;t read this wrong. I just don&#x27;t want to replicate everything that is written in the Typescript Handbook ( https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html )
The first one is adequately handled in Typescript. Just by using:
enum MyEnum {
  first,
  second,
  third
}

But the second case looks more like this:
enum MyStringEnum {
  first &#x3D; &#x27;first&#x27;,
  second &#x3D; &#x27;second&#x27;,
  third &#x3D; &#x27;third&#x27;

As the number of values  increase, it starts getting difficult to manage. And I see lot of boilerplate here. Also, there is scope for mistakes. For example, it is possible to get into this situation:

How has been your week? I hope everyone had a great week. In todays tutorial let us go through Object Oriented Programming (OOP). 
Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects
Object programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.
The Object class represents one of JavaScript&#x27;s data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object() constructor or the object initializer / literal syntax.

Let&#x27;s begin to learn how to add otp component in your angular app.  
npm install --save ng-otp-input

NgOtpInputModule to imports app.module.ts something like





import { BrowserModule } from &#x27;@angular/platform-browser&#x27;;
import { NgModule } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;
import { AppComponent } from &#x27;./app.component&#x27;;
import { NgOtpInputModule } from &#x27;ng-otp-input&#x27;;

@NgModule({ 
declarations: [AppComponent], 
imports: [BrowserModule, NgOtpInputModule], 
bootstrap: [AppComponent] 
})

Here in your existing app you have to add import { NgOtpInputModule } from &#x27;ng-otp-input&#x27;; near all existing imports and then add imports in NgModule as NgOtpInputModule with your ‚Ä¶</span>

Race conditions are easy to understand. They‚Äôre just like a high-five which depends on 2 people slapping hands at the same exact time. If one person is out of sync, the other may get a high-five to the face ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Boom! Race conditions explained!

In this article, we are going to talk about UX Race Conditions and using a simple interceptor to exaggerate delays from the API that you can see if you are giving your users the best experience possible.
In the classic sense, race conditions can cause bugs and unintended manipulation of your data. @vsavkin
 shows us an example of how a user can trigger a new request before the last request had finished, causing unintended data to be used.
But let&#x27;s talk about the User Experience. Could the User Experience also suffer‚Ä¶</span>

Now, let&#x27;s get you convinced by building up a minimally realistic example.

                    <span>JavaScript‚Äôs creator, Brendan Eich, had no choice but to create the language very quickly (or other, worse technologies would have been adopted by Netscape). He borrowed from several programming languages: Java (syntax, primitive values versus objects),
JavaScript did not have exception handling until ECMAScript 3, which explains why the language so often automatically converts values and so often fails silently: it initially couldn‚Äôt throw exceptions.
On one hand, JavaScript has quirks and is missing quite a bit of functionality (blockscoped variables, modules, support for subclassing, etc.). On the other hand, it has several powerful features that allow you to work around these problems. In other languages, you learn language features. In JavaScript, you often learn patterns instead. Given its influences, it is no surprise that JavaScript enables a programming style that is a mixture of functional programming (higher-order functions; built-in map, reduce, etc.) and object-oriented programming (objects, inheritance).</span>

                    <span>Containerization of apps is a fast-growing practice as many companies are embracing the cloud and DevOps concepts. Docker packages an application, libraries, and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any server. Being that most applications do not run on one single component (even dinosaur apps ü¶ñ have frontend and backend components), we need a way to define and manage multi-container apps.
In this tutorial I will utilize Docker compose to get a blog up and running that consists of a Ghost Blog service and a MYSQL service; both services will use volumes for persistent storage. This tutorial assumes you have working knowledge of Docker and a server with Docker and Docker compose installed.

Compose is a file format for describing distributed Docker apps, and it‚Äôs a tool for managing them.
Ghost is a free and open source blogging platform written in Javascript.
1. SSH into the server and become root
ssh @PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS
sudo su -
Step 2 ‚Äî Create a Ghost Blog and MySQL service
2. Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root directory
vi docker-compose.yml
Add the following contents
version: &#x27;3&#x27;
services:
  ghost:
    image: ghost:1-alpine
    container_name: ghost-blog
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:2368
    environment:
      database__client: mysql
      database__connection__host: mysql
      database__connection__user: root
      database__connection__password: P4sSw0rd0!
      database__connection__database: ghost
    volumes:
      - ghost-volume:/var/lib/ghost
    depends_on:
      - mysql

  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    container_name: ghost-db
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: P4sSw0rd0!
    volumes:
      - mysql-volume:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  ghost-volume:
  mysql-volume:

3. docker-compose up -d
Congrats your blog is up and running! Validate via the public IP address of your Docker server.

                    <span>First up some basics
WSL2 with ubuntu 20.04
A lot of the logic in the scripts I write rely on bash&#x27;s if.. then.. else. The basic syntax of the statement is as follows:
 
    if [ {statement} {operator} {value} ]
[...] tells bash to evaluate the command and return 0 or 1 for the conditional expression inside the square brackets.
tldr; ensure things evaluate correctly.
&gt; is used to redirect the output of a command somewhere.
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$ cp file1 file2
   cp: cannot stat &#x27;file1&#x27;: No such file or directory
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$ cp file1 file2 &gt;&amp;- 2&gt;&amp;-
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$

$? returns the success of the previous command, 0 for success and &gt;&#x3D; 1 for failure. Lets look at the previous example and see what the output is.
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$ cp file1 file2 &gt;&amp;- 2&gt;&amp;-
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$ echo $?
   1

   #!/bin/bash
   cp file1 file2 &gt;&amp;- 2&gt;&amp;-
   if [&quot;$?&quot; &#x3D; &quot;1&quot; ]
   then
      touch file1
      cp file1 file2
   else
     echo &quot;File copied to file 2&quot; 
   fi


#!/bin/bash
# Check we have a parameter

if [ &quot;$1&quot; &#x3D; &quot;&quot; ]
then
   echo &quot;syntax: old {filename}&quot;
fi

# Copy the file as .old
newFileName&#x3D;&quot;$1.old&quot;
echo $newFileName
cp $1 $newFileName &gt;&amp;- 2&gt;&amp;-

if [ &quot;$?&quot; &#x3D; &quot;0&quot; ]
then
      echo &quot;File has aged and has had &#x27;.old&#x27; appended to it&quot;
      exit 0
else
     echo &quot;File has not been born yet or you do not have parental rights to the file.&quot;
     exit 1
fi

                    <span>In this article, we&#x27;ll explain how to install Dotnet Core on Ubuntu.
.NET Core is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications. Software developers often need to use the Dotnet core framework on the Linux system to test, run, and build the packages.
The notion of using Dotnet on Linux comes true through the new Dotnet core, which is an API based modular system of Microsoft‚Äôs Dotnet framework. But the Dotnet core doesn‚Äôt act as a single API; it functions as a shared or public library of API and codes.
Prerequisites
An Ubuntu installed system.
A root user access of normal user with administrative privileges.

                    <span>I fear to even think of creating a new master password / PIN (without relying on variation play).
I mean, practically.
Passphrase?
How many words?
I don&#x27;t speak English, so which language? Non-ASCII scripts? Keyboard-layout-based? (Typing non-ASCII on QWERTY)
Does it need punctuations? How do you add them? How many?
Non-passphrase?
Next is, how long would it take to memorize it without tools / helpers? What helpers did you use?
Lastly, how many masters do you have? How closely they are related?
Related, also. How about numerical PINs?</span>

                    <span>Hello üëã
Today I&#x27;m writing to tell you about the future of NodeSecure üëÄ.
I have not been very active in the last few months because of my job which has taken up a lot of my time. But I&#x27;m back üòä.
Moving forward and updating the project has become much more complicated üòµ. So it was time to announce and make major changes.
NodeSecure is not only one tool anymore. The project is now a set of tools and packages that need to be maintained and extended. The project has also gained contributors on its way and many developers pushed me to go even further üöÄ.
That&#x27;s why I decided to gather these different projects in the same github organization (and same for npm with @nodesecure). It will also be easier to integrate new collaborators into the project.

                    <span>Grouparoo uses Next.js to build our web frontend(s), and we distribute these frontend User Interfaces (UIs) via NPM as packages, e.g. @grouparoo/ui-community. This allows Grouparoo users to choose which UI they want to use (or none) by changing their package.json:
Example package.json for a Grouparoo project:

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
