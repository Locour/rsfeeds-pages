With the Angular CLI no longer including a complete out-of-the-box development solution, it is more important than ever to understand the tools at our disposal to improve the developer experience when building Angular applications.
Modern Angular Tooling is the term used to describe modern tools that will enable you and your team to build a comprehensive development environment. This development environment takes advantage of the latest improvements in the JavaScript ecosystem to improve productivity, consistency, reliability, scalability and developer experience when building Angular applications and libraries.

                    <span>Top Reasons Why Everyone is Opting for ReactJS over Angular
1. Better Performance
React is mostly like a library than just a framework. Therefore, one does not has to work upfront with DOM or Data Object Model. Instead of that, it goes for a Virtual DOM layer. It updates only those parts of the actual DOM which is needed to update. This escalates the development speed in React instead of Angular. 
Moreover, the Virtual DOM is one of the best features to have as it resolves the issues associated with cross-browser.
The developers also get access to a unified API of cross-browser that runs even on old browser versions. Such excellent performance of React has made everyone not hire AngularJS developers and opt for ReactJS developers as it is becoming more and more popular than Angular.

                    <span>Introduction


Angular comes with many built-in directives. Some of them (eg. NgIf, NgModel or FormControlDirective) are used daily by Angular developers. Those directives can be split into 2 categories:
Attribute directives
They can be used to modify the appearance of behavior of Angular components and DOM elements. For example:
RouterLink
NgModel
FormControlDirective
Structural directives
They can be used to manipulate the HTML structure in the DOM. Using them, we can change the structure of part of the DOM that they control. For example:
NgIf
NgForOf
NgSwitch
In this article, I will focus on the latter.
As I&#x27;ve mentioned above, there are a couple of built-in structural directives in Angular. However, we might come across a case that the ones provided with the framework don&#x27;t solve. This…</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s not uncommon to see Angular apps slow down over time. Angular is a performant platform, but if we don&#x27;t know how to create performant Angular apps, our apps will become slower as they evolve. As a result, any serious Angular developer must be aware of what makes an Angular app slow in order to prevent it from being slow in the first place.
Change detection can be the most performance-intensive part of Angular apps, so it&#x27;s important to understand how to render the templates efficiently so that we would just re-rendering a component if it has new changes to display.
When an asynchronous event occurs in the app, such as click, XMLHttpRequest, or setTimeout, the default change detection behavior for components is to re-render. This can be a matter of concern because it will result in a l…</span>

Learning AWS is complicated enough. But learning AWS is made more challenging when you&#x27;re also still grappling with some of the major concepts of DevOps software deployments. In this article, I discuss two key concepts: stacks and stages. I also address how you can manage stacks and stages in AWS, along with other factors you need to consider when managing them in practice. 
In simplest terms, a stack is a unit of application deployment. Using stacks, developers can organize all of the resources required by an application or an application component as a single unit. This enables devs to deploy, tear down, and re-deploy their applications at will. 
Stacks can be stood up manually. However, it&#x27;s better on cloud platforms to program the creation of your stack - e.g., usi…</span>

There are many articles on applying machine learning for log analysis. However, most of them are dated, academic in nature, or don’t focus on practical outcomes. On Dev.to, most of the articles cover ML courses or the difference between deep learning and machine learning.
In this article, we want to share our real-life experience on using ML/AI for log analysis and anomaly detection with the specific purpose of automatically uncovering the root cause of software issues.
We will also discuss the various approaches to ML-based log analysis, some of the existing challenges, and provide details of our approach to solving these problems.

                    <span>Transmitting Data Via the Client


Many applications leave themselves exposed because they transmit critical data such as product prices and discount rates via the client in an unsafe manner.
If possible, applications should avoid transmitting this kind of data via the client. In virtually any conceivable scenario, it is possible to hold such data on the server and reference it directly from server-side logic when needed. 
For example, an application that receives users’ orders for various products should allow users to submit a product code and quantity and look up the price of each requested product in a server-side database. There is no need for users to submit the prices of items back to the server. Even where an application offers different prices or discounts to different users, ther…</span>

                    <span>I’ve spent most of my career as an application/web developer, so primarily glueing X to Y to do a thing that I love doing! And my exposure to operating through DevOps has been through the lens of an application developer.
I’ve recently joined CloudQuery, which is an open-source cloud asset inventory powered by SQL. What this means is that I’m learning more about infrastructure than I’ve ever done before. With that, I’m learning about things like infrastructure as code through Terraform and the concept of infrastructure drift.
Simply put, it’s when the state of your infrastructure is different from the state set by your IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code). For example, if you’ve deployed five lambdas via terraform with the default 128 MB of memory, but now three of them are using 256 MB then you h…</span>

                    <span>I recently upgraded a service written in golang which was deployed using Google&#x27;s AppEngine and I have just one word for the experience. It was unpleasant. Just to be clear, I really am all in for golang and was also impressed with how easy it is to deploy any service using gcloud. Unfortunately the ride from go1.1 to go.1.2+ was more of a roller coaster for me. Let’s take a glimpse of this three-course meal together so that we can be well prepared for the next upgrade.
I had already run my code locally using dev_appserver.py --enable_host_checking&#x3D;no --support_datastore_emulator&#x3D;yes app.yaml , verified the entries in the datastore and was fairly satisfied with the code that I had written.

                    <span>How to access your server anywhere without SSH.
You want to have temporary access of your server from a remote location


You don&#x27;t want to authorize a key to connect via ssh






OK now lets get into the process.
root access
A Linux machine with ports 3023, 3024, 3025, and 443 open
A registered domain name
An SSH client like OpenSSH.
2FA App
visit Teleport website




Click getting started, and select the community edition

Select acconding your platform, for me its Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, so I select the Linux 64-bit DEB version 8.0

Now login to your server via ssh, and download teleport using wget by running wget https://get.gravitational.com/teleport_8.0.0_amd64.deb




Install the deb package by sudo apt install ./teleport_8.0.0_amd64.deb




Configure your domain for SSL certificate




sudo teleport configure --acme --acme-email&#x3D;your-email@example.com --cluster-name&#x3D;tele.example.com -o /etc/teleport.yaml

443 you needed to edit it and change the port (/etc/teleport.yaml) [Included at last step].




Now start the teleport sudo systemctl start teleport.service


Add user with




tctl users add teleport-admin --roles&#x3D;editor,access --logins&#x3D;root,ubuntu,ec2-user

It will give you a url to access the teleport


Follow the steps in the webpage to activate







  
  
  For users with port address being used by other process



Open the config file in /etc/teleport.yaml

Go to the line where




web_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:443
public_addr: tele.example.com:443

Change the port address there


reload teleport service by sudo systemctl restart teleport.service

                    <span>I picked up Cyberpunk 2077 on GOG at 50% off for black friday. I had a bit of trouble getting it to work on Linux (POP!_OS), here are my steps in case it helps someone else. 
First, I spun up Lutris and the game downloaded and installed fine. But when I tried to launch it, it first crashed, then on second launch it played but felt like I was watching a stop motion video. 
After googling, I found proton-tkg which is a patched version of Steam&#x27;s proton. Downloaded:
wget https://github.com/Frogging-Family/wine-tkg-git/releases/download/6.17.r0.g5f19a815/proton_tkg_6.17.r0.g5f19a815.release.tar.gz

Unpacked it
tar xf proton_tkg_6.17.r0.g5f19a815.release.tar.gz

Then I linked it to the runners and restarted Lutris.
ln -s /home//Downloads/proton_tkg_6.17.r0.g5f19a815.release/files/ /home//.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/proton

Selected the proton item under the Runner Options:

I&#x27;ve been playing for an hour now, it&#x27;s smooth and hasn&#x27;t crashed. YMMV
Good Luck Have Fun!

                    <span>Like many others I&#x27;ve been blown way by the incredible performance and capabilities of vite as a tool for rapidly building out React apps. In my role as an egghead educator and a Developer Advocate at PayPal I&#x27;m looking for tools that install quickly, have minimal setup costs and let me start building immediately. vite does all that and more, but in the past I often run into one limitation: I need some kind of API to complement my apps.

I&#x27;ve been using express to build out APIs pretty much since it first came out. Checkout my course on using express 5 if you want a quick tutorial. Express makes it easy to build out APIs and it&#x27;s super easy to add express support to your vite app. You just need a single plugin: vite-plugin-mix.
I promised 5 seconds, so get ready to copy &amp; paste!
npm install -D vite-plugin-mix

Then in your vite.config.js file add this to your plugins array
mix({
  handler: &#x27;./api.js&#x27;,
}),

And then in api.js type:
import express from &#x27;express&#x27;;

const app &#x3D; express();

app.get(&quot;/api/hello&quot;, (req, res) &#x3D;&gt; {
  res.json({ hello: &quot;world&quot; });
});

export const handler &#x3D; app;

Once you do that you can startup vite with npm run dev and like magic you&#x27;ll have the ability to reference /api/hello on your local dev server. Like everything else in vite, if you make any changes to your API they&#x27;ll be available immediately without having to restart anything. Just edit the code and call the route again and you&#x27;ll see the latest!
One little note: I have only used vite so far for local development and can&#x27;t personally vouch for it for production apps. If you&#x27;re looking for something a bit more production ready you might want to check out fastify-vite which combines another popular API server, fastify with vite for one powerful and fast full-stack development tool.
Happy hacking friends!</span>

                    <span>Caching is the process of storing copies of files in a cache, or temporary storage location, so that they can be accessed more quickly. 

There is commonly two types of caching :-
1) Server side caches are generally used to avoid making expensive database operations repeatedly to serve up the same content to lots of different clients. 
2) Client side caches are used to avoid transferring the same data over the network repeatedly.
Today we will learn basic server side caching using redis(a fast, open source, in-memory, key-value data store).
Installing Redis:-
Firstly we will need to install redis before using it in our project.

                    <span>Data structure is the collection of data values, the relationship among them and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data according to Wikipedia.
Memory in Data structure
For example:
1 represented as a byte is 0000 0001         
2 represented as a byte is 0000 0010
3 represented as a byte is 0000 0011
4 represented as a byte is 0000 0100

These are represented in base 2. And that gives us a finite amount of numbers we can store because base 2^8 &#x3D; 256. So to save bigger numbers, we increase the bytes. 
In java for example, &quot;int&quot; is the equivalent of 4 bytes, 32 bits integer. Type &quot;long&quot; represents 8 bytes, a 64 bits integer.
Endianness in Data Structure
65,000 decimal number in base 2 is: 0b11111101 11101000.
0b here helps us know it is in base 2 and not 1,111,110,111,101,000

The answer above is in big-endian byte because the byte with the biggest 0b11111101 is written first reading from left to right. We can confirm this by converting the big-endian padded by another byte of zeros &quot;0b1111110100000000 to base 10&quot; on google. The result is 64,768 which is very close to our initial number of 65,000.
For networks, the standard is Big-endian and for most PCs, the standard is Little-endian. Check this code snippet online to find out what endian your machine runs. My machine runs on Little-endian.
Endianness has largely ceased to be a matter of concern because of modern computer languages removing this needless complexity and processors which are Bi-endian and can handle both.</span>

                    <span>Last week, I was looking for a repository to contribute to. Looking for a repository to contribute is always the hardest step, because you need to adapt to the new project, get used to the code structure, and you have to learn a lot of things about the codebase before contributing something meaningful.🥵🥵
After searching for a while, I found Hexo, an SSG. I was interested on working on this one since I am working on an SSG myself. I thought, &quot;maybe I can get some inspiration from them on how to approach the design of my SSG🕵️‍♀️🕵️‍♀️&quot;

                    <span>For application access, you should not use the managed AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for Amazon DynamoDB. These IAM policies are designed for use with the AWS Web Console and therefore have more permissions to more services than most applications need access to. Instead, please create your own IAM policies for DynamoDB.
In order to follow least privilege security conventions, it is best practice to create your own custom IAM policy for DynamoDB access by an application. If this is something you have never done before, don&#x27;t be intimidated. I got ya. To get you started, here are a few templates I created to use to enable full access to only Amazon DynamoDB table resources. 
Once you play with these templates, you should ultimately create a new policy that narrows access down to just the operations the app needs to do on the resources it needs to do it. If all you are doing is SELECT and INSERT with the PartiQL API for DynamoDB on one table, then the only actions you should allow are these two:
&quot;dynamodb:PartiQLInsert&quot;
&quot;dynamodb:PartiQLSelect&quot;
In summary, use security best practices when designing access to Amazon DynamoDB for your apps, create your own customer managed IAM policies and do not use the AWS managed IAM policies.</span>

                    <span>Transmitting Data Via the Client


Many applications leave themselves exposed because they transmit critical data such as product prices and discount rates via the client in an unsafe manner.
If possible, applications should avoid transmitting this kind of data via the client. In virtually any conceivable scenario, it is possible to hold such data on the server and reference it directly from server-side logic when needed. 
For example, an application that receives users’ orders for various products should allow users to submit a product code and quantity and look up the price of each requested product in a server-side database. There is no need for users to submit the prices of items back to the server. Even where an application offers different prices or discounts to different users, ther…</span>

I was in my 2nd-year @delhitechnicalcampus. College timing is 9 to 4 pm, and I have to rush to pick public transport at 7 pm. It took 2 hours to reach college in between route of Noida to Pari chowk. I used this new service Shuttl. 
Shuttl - They provide Transport service from Noida Sector 37 to Pari Chowk. I am inspired by this startup as they provide 30 rupee journey costs in 10 rupees and with AC minibus.

So, for the first ride, they provide a free Coupon Ride, which is one time applicable. BUT why so and why don&#x27;t we apply again so? For this, I made a Dual app and login with my secondary number, but that code is not valid for the second number. What the Hackman!

I need to figure out how&#x27;s this thing working and why can&#x27;t I apply code in my secondary number account…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Angular comes with many built-in directives. Some of them (eg. NgIf, NgModel or FormControlDirective) are used daily by Angular developers. Those directives can be split into 2 categories:
Attribute directives
They can be used to modify the appearance of behavior of Angular components and DOM elements. For example:
RouterLink
NgModel
FormControlDirective
Structural directives
They can be used to manipulate the HTML structure in the DOM. Using them, we can change the structure of part of the DOM that they control. For example:
NgIf
NgForOf
NgSwitch
In this article, I will focus on the latter.
As I&#x27;ve mentioned above, there are a couple of built-in structural directives in Angular. However, we might come across a case that the ones provided with the framework don&#x27;t solve. This…</span>

At the end of this tutorial, we will learn how to create a database on MongoDB, serverless functions as our endpoints using MongoDB Realm and consume the endpoints in a React.js application.
MongoDB Realm is a development platform designed for building mobile, web, desktop, and IoT applications. It offers services like data synchronization, serverless functions, triggers, user authentication, e.t.c. We can build and maintain app…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 13 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
Form validation enables the quality, accuracy, and integrity of the user input data. It’s possible to validate a form in Angular in two ways, one with reactive (using functions in the component class) and the other with template-driven forms (using attributes in the HTML) and we will use the template-driven forms way.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the application with the Angular base structure using the @angular/cli with the route file and the SCSS style…</span>

                    <span>These are some rules that I have lazily picked up over the past four years of professional development on angular.
I generally work on small to medium projects without the time to integrate a formal state management system.
It is for this reason that there are data services that try to solve the problem of carrying communication around. If anyone has any further questions or curiosities regarding these points feel free to leave a comment.
methods must be extracted into functions until nothing can be extracted anymore
the component logic shold refer only to local resources of the component as much as possible
dataservices deal with data I/O with the server
the business Logic must live within the dataservice and all components should be of assistance to the business Logic, visualization assistance and small local logics to visualize and modify data
components (internal to the feature internal to the root component) must implement the root dataservice or receive data as input (observables are strongly preferred)
avoid multi-level handovers through inputs, it slows you down and makes refactoring a hassle
if the data as input changed hands more than twice use a dataservice,
each feature must have its own module and declare components related only to that feature
putting the general dataservice next to the feature module is the best way to indicate the root from which to start exploring the code
the beginning of the end of the data flow must take place within the dataservice

the substrate cache-services for API calls must live in the provide of the feature module they belong to and refer to
components  can be interaction contexts between dataservices but services are preferred when possible
interaction services can be interaction contexts between dataservices</span>

                    <span>So, recently I ran into an issue where one of my functions was not being implemented &quot;at the correct time.&quot; The solution was to trigger it in another component via ngOnInit.
Moving the code was simple, but in the process I ran into an issue that I&#x27;ve seen before but not dug into.
The issue is that I like to use fat-arrow functions in my code (() &#x3D;&gt; {}) and somewhere along the way I converted an ngOnInit to fat-arrow. I unknowingly broke the OnInit lifecycle hook complete.
ngOnInit &#x3D; async (): Promise &#x3D;&gt; {
  await this.init();
  ...
};

The fix was actually pretty simple, I converted the code back to a traditional function pattern ...
async ngOnInit(): Promise {
  await this.init();
  ...
}

... and my function started working again.
Be careful (yes, I am telling myself this) as you may inadvertently write code that does not execute correctly. It was a simple mistake and one that was hidden by some layers of async behavior.</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(2 min)</span>
                    <span>Suppose you have the requirement that you want to show list of users if the url is /user, and you want to show user detail of a particular user when the URL is /user/useId.
To achieve this we can create a users component, then in its ngOnInit we could check if params are present.
/// Here route is ActivatedRoute

this.route.queryParams.subscribe(params &#x3D;&gt; {

if(params.userId){
//// Do Something
console.log(params.userId);
}
});


You can get the params like this and then write your logic accordindly. If params are present then show userDetails if not then list of users.
Like So
const routes: Routes &#x3D; [
  { path: &#x27;/user&#x27;, component: UsersComponent },
  { path: &#x27;/user:userId&#x27;, component : UserDetailsComponent}
];

Here we are explicitly stating that if url is /user then show UsersComponent or if it is like /users/xxxid then show userDetials page.
This is more Systematic &amp; preferred way of doing the task.
If you are using only one parameter then use parameterized route. But if you have many parameters then use querry Params as stated above in solution 1.

  {{user.name}}


Assume we are having list users and clicking on a user name will open that particlular user details.
To get the value of ther parameter use ActivatedRoute
console.log(this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get(&#x27;userId&#x27;);

Points To remember
If you are getting any error remember to recheck the route you had written. sometimes you append extra / like user/:userId/ or prepend extra slash (/) like /user/:userId.
Although you can use more then two parameters
like  user/:userId/:id/:age 
I would suggest to avoid it and if it cannot be avoided atleast limit it to two parameters.</span>

                    <span>What is RxJs?


Reactive Extensions for JavaScriptis a library for reactive programming. RxJS uses observables which will make it easier to compose call back-based code or asynchronous code.
If you are working with Angular, you should at least be familiar with RxJs.The angular framework itself is build using RxJs and around some of the RxJs concepts. We can do much more by using RxJs and observable like better and more readable code and we can even reduce the number of lines of code
The component is a key part of the Angular App structure. Everything in Angular comes around the state of the component and how it will be projected in the UI. On many occasions, we can use streams that will help us to represent volatile pieces of our data inside the view.
RxJs provides an implementation that i…</span>

  - job_name: &#x27;prometheus&#x27;

    # metrics_path defaults to &#x27;/metrics&#x27;
    # scheme defaults to &#x27;http&#x27;.

    static_configs:
      - targets: [&#x27;localhost:9090&#x27;]

  - job_name: &#x27;node-exporter&#x27;

    # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
    scrape_interval: 5s
    metrics_path: /metrics

    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - :9100

This is a good starting place for a monitoring system for Linux boxes
Running the services in docker is also advised as it simplifies the rollout.
Docker node exporter:
sudo docker run --restart always -d --net&#x3D;&quot;host&quot; --pid&#x3D;&quot;host&quot;  -v &quot;/:/host:ro,rslave&quot;  prom/node-exporter:latest  --path.rootfs&#x3D;/host

Docker prometheus:
sudo docker service create --replicas 1 --name dockerprometheus     --mount type&#x3D;bind,source&#x3D;/home/ubuntu/prometheus/prometheus.yml,destination&#x3D;/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml     --publish published&#x3D;9090,target&#x3D;9090,protocol&#x3D;tcp     prom/prometheus

When you get around to making panels in Grafana, these queries are very useful:
100 - ((node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint&#x3D;&quot;/&quot;,fstype!&#x3D;&quot;rootfs&quot;} * 100) /            node_filesystem_size_bytes{mountpoint&#x3D;&quot;/&quot;,fstype!&#x3D;&quot;rootfs&quot;})

node_filesystem_avail_bytes


OR you could just setup a template for Node Exporter:

Enter 405 for the Grafana ID.

Pick up the name and choose a Data Source for the dashboard.

To make an alert, start a NEW dashboard and NEW panel. Template dashboards like above will not work. 
Enter the query for the item you want to track and press the Alert tab.
That should do it for a basic monitoring service.</span>

When using the Command Line Interface, we often find a few long and / or confusing commands. And this post intends to ease the pain of getting along with that.
When things start to get complicated, there are some things that can be done. In this post, we are talking about three of them:
Aliases
Functions
Comments
An alias is exactly what it means: a nickname. It is very useful when running commands that take too much arguments. For example:
alias lah&#x3D;ls -ltrah

Now, when running the lah command, it will be exactly like running ls -ltrah.
A function is probably the best way to run a group of commands. When adding a if or a for statement, it gets even more interesting. Let&#x27;s suppose we want to connect to a server which is still being provisioned or rebooted:
function keeptrying() {

One thing i spotted when i started using Tech Twitter was people would post screenshots of there system specifications in terminals with pretty logos etc and i wanted to know how it was all done!...... its actually SUPER simple.
NeoFetch is a free, easy to install application which gathers system information and prints it to the terminal in a &quot;pretty way&quot;. It pulls together all of your system information and strips out the crap and displays it in a way that doesnt hurt the brain....
Installing NeoFetch is as easy as typing the following two commands....
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dawidd0811/neofetch


and
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install neofetch


this add the official NeoFetch PPA to your ubuntu installation and means you will always get the most up to date version.
after that simply type neofetch in your terminal and you will get a screenshot like below.

Another app you can use is screenfetch which does near enough the exact same thing!.
Install it with the following command:
sudo apt install screenfetch


and then just type screenfetch in your terminal to get your system specs like below.

Well thats going to do it today hope this quick blog post will be of interest and help you out. as a side note you can also get Screenfetch for MacOS.

                    <span>Docker es un software de código abierto que automatiza el despliegue de aplicaciones con el uso de contenedores. Esto hace que sea más fácil empaquetar y aislar el  software para que  pueda implementarse más tarde en otro entorno. Todo esto proporcionando una API muy fácil de usar.
Podrá surgir la duda &quot;¿Qué es un contenedor?&quot; en algunos. Un contenedor es la unidad  de software estándar que encapsula el código y todas sus dependencias para que una aplicación se ejecute de manera eficiente y sólida independientemente del entorno en el que se implemente.
Las instrucciones para crear el contenedor son llamadas &quot;imagen&quot;. Esta imagen se puede compartir, y podrá replicar con totalidad el contenedor original en cualquier sitio donde se despliegue. Dentro de estas instrucciones se encuentra el cód…</span>

                    <span>Let’s say you are writing a shell script for a systems housekeeping task. Perhaps the script is uploading backups to a remote server, or it is cleaning up old data, or it is making a measurement and submitting it to a somebody else’s HTTP API. What is the least cumbersome way for the script to contact you in case of problems? Let’s say you want to be contacted via email – how to make it work?
If you run the script from cron, you can look into using cron’s MAILTO&#x3D; option. You put a MAILTO&#x3D;you@example.org line in your crontab, and, when a job fails, cron will send a notification to the specified address using system’s MTA. OK, then, what MTA to use?

                    <span>I bet that everyone here has heard about Linux. However, only a few can use it because their hardware doesn&#x27;t work with Linux.
In my case, I want to use Ubuntu 21.10 on my laptop, Acer Swift 5 - SF514-52T, but I can&#x27;t because there&#x27;s no sound coming out of the HDMI port. I have filed this issue here.
I also can&#x27;t connect my Bluetooth headset, Sony WH-CH710N, at all. The headset paired successfully but it just won&#x27;t connect. I believe that this could be solved using the method provided here but I didn&#x27;t have a chance to try it yet.
In fact, I had tried to run Linux on this laptop since Ubuntu 19.04 came out but fail because the integrated mic didn&#x27;t work at all. Fortunately, this issue is fixed on Ubuntu 21.10.
Nevertheless, the sound system on Linux is a mess...
Linux will not succeed in the desktop market unless it works on most laptops considering that laptops already sell nearly 3 times more than PCs.
Hey, Linux, see you again in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, KDE neon, or SteamOS 3.0!</span>

                    <span>In the last few weeks, I&#x27;ve finally wrangled my head around Docker a bit. 
As a demo, I&#x27;ve built a docker container for kiterunner.
Kiterunner is an API-fuzzing tool, very useful for bug bounty hunters and pen-testers. Shoutouts to @insiderphd for introducing me to the tool. I should have watched that video sooner!
Like any good tool, it requires some installation stuff beforehand.
I realized this is a good opportunity to begin integrating Docker into my workflow in a potentially useful way.

                    <span>Today we released the latest edition of our Monster project. Monster is a collection of javascript classes that we need for daily work in our web projects.
Besides small helper functions and classes it also provides useful functions to enable reactive programming.
Monster is available via jsdelivr and npm.
Only the changes are described here. The full functionality can be found in the documentation.
We have added a new class to handle resources. Resources are external content such as scripts, data, or stylesheets.
These classes are usually used by the ResourceManager.
The class takes care of creating the tags and monitors the load event.
With the new class RessourceManager scripts, styles and data can be included in an HTML page simply by specifying the URL.

                    <span>Proyectos como Plant vs Undead, Decentraland, Sandbox, Crypto Cars, Axie Infinity han sido el primer arcercamiento con el modelo Play to Earn. En este video vamos a ver que necesitas para crear tu juego que premie a los jugadores con tokens por jugar.





  
  
  Dependencias


Para este tutorial ocuparás NodeJs que recomiendo descargarlo en Linux via NVM , también necesitarás un URL de RPC te recomiendo usar INFURA, y finalmente Metamask con fondos de Rinkeby Testnet que puedes conseguir desde el Faucet.
Primero bajamos el proyecto Demo.
git clone https://github.com/FilosofiaCodigo/PlayToEarnDemo.git
cd PlayToEarnDemo/

Ahora instalamos las dependencias.
npm install

Antes de lanzar debemos agregar el archivo de configuración .env que puedes construir en base al arhivo de ejemplo .env.example.
Finalmente lanzamos.
npx truffle deploy --network rinkeby --reset

Primero ingresamos en la carpeta del backend e instalamos las dependencias.
cd backend
npm install

Luego crea un nuevo archivo .env pero esta vez en la carpeta /backend, este archivo contiene lo mismo que creamos en el paso 1.
También debes copypastear el archivo ./build/MyToken.json en ./backend/MyToken.json.
Finalmente edita acorde las variables CONTRACT_ADDRESS y BACKEND_WALLET_ADDRESS en ./backend/backend.js.
Ahora levantamos el servidor backend.
node backend.js

Para poder jugar en el frontend debemos lanzar la web del cliente. Para eso ingresamos en la carpeta del cliente e instalamos la única dependencia de manera global.
cd client
npm i -g lite-server

Igual como lo hicimos antes, debes copypastear el archivo ./build/MyToken.json esta vez en ./client/MyToken.json.
Una vez hecho esto lanzamos el juego.
lite-server

Recuerda agregar el contrato a metamask para observar cómo obtienes tokens por jugar.

You may have found this article for several reasons. Maybe you just landed a big promotion to CISO/CSO or you’re looking to become one soon. You could have been a CISO or security lead for a while now and are looking for new ideas. Whatever brought you here, you will come away with a game plan for strengthening your information security program.
First and foremost, a CISO is an advocate for good information security practices within the business. Stating it like that makes it sound simple, but there are so many responsibilities and considerations that go into a complete information security program. Security considerations go far beyond just technical controls. The many domains of cyber security could be listed along with key components of each, but it’s much easier to provi…</span>

                    <span>Hello 👋
I have been working on the NodeSecure project for almost three years now 😵. I have personally come a long way... At the beginning I didn&#x27;t know much about the field in which I started 🐤.
That&#x27;s why I thought that writing articles about &quot;some&quot; of the technical difficulties and the tools I used could be valuable 🚀.
I will try to make articles that focus on one aspect 🎯. Let&#x27;s get started 💃.
One of the first challenges I had to solve was how to get the dependency tree and all the information attached to the packages.
My first instinct was to work with the public API of the npm registry.
What I wanted to do has already been implemented in the package named pacote.

                    <span>In most CRUD operations and REST APIs, primary keys are used to reference models that you want to access or modify. A majority of APIs will take an ID as a parameter in a route:
GET /api/v1/posts/:id

// Return the Post resource with an ID of 457
GET /api/v1/posts/457

While it&#x27;s the simplest and most effective way of specifying the model to use, we often don&#x27;t want to show these IDs to the user. By displaying primary keys, you give users the ability to estimate the number of rows in your tables. If authorization isn&#x27;t effective or routes aren&#x27;t protected, users could input random numbers to access information that they otherwise shouldn&#x27;t have.
Using obfuscated IDs can be useful in social media or feed contexts, where the content isn&#x27;t used in the URL, but you want something less signific…</span>

In this tutorial I will be using:
Vue 2
Vuex ^3.6.2
TypeScript 4.5

Now let&#x27;s start coding! First we have to create our Vue.js app. To do that run:
vue create vuex-counter

and make sure you include Vuex, TypeScript and Use class components in your options.




Let&#x27;s now create the Vuex store. The store will consist of a singular state which will contain the main count from where we&#x27;ll derive the incremented and decremented ones.
src/store/index.ts
import Vue from &quot;vue&quot;;
import Vuex from &quot;vuex&quot;;

Vue.use(Vuex);

export default new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    count: 1,
  },
  getters: {},
  mutations: {},
  actions: {},
  modules: {},
});

Using the count variable in the state we will use getters…</span>

  Why Rust?



As a Front-End developer, there is a lot you need to learn and keep up to date. One of the biggest changes coming to web development is  web3.0, if you are not living under a rock you have probably heard about it,  at least a little. With these changes coming to the web I decided to learn rust to make myself more valuable, this decision also comes after researching the kind of projects you could do. One of them is a compiler, which funny enough my favorite React framework Next uses. I am a big fan of Next and my goal is to understand how rust  made a framework that was already fast even faster.

                    <span>One distinctive difference between TypeScript and JavaScript is the difference in typing: JavaScript is dynamically typed, where the data type is determined at runtime, while TypeScript is statically typed, where the type is defined in advance.
While being able to type makes it easier to notice errors at compile time, there are many times when typing does not work. So, let&#x27;s practice typing!

The one on the official MUI&#x27;s Github repo featuring Next.js with TypeScript (my framework of choice) didn&#x27;t follow standard Next.js folder structure, as of this writing.
So I felt inclined to create one with the most basic features that I would use myself. The result is on my Github (link below).
Here&#x27;s a screenshot of the About page:

It features a standard folder structure as generated by create-next-app and the leanest usable ESLint + Prettier configs for linting/formatting.

This article can be used other than React as well, but I will focused on React ecosystem, so just skip the React part if you do other than React. 😉
So, today I am discussing how you can move from the Javascript world to the Typescript wonderland. But before that, there is one question you need to ask yourself first, &quot;Why do I need to use Typescript in the first place 🤔?&quot;
Honestly, Typescript might introduce a little bit more learning curve, and maybe a little bit more on syntax, with a trade of shorter and verbose syntax. Of course, there are more to just shorter and verbose.
So, the good of Typescript:
Moving from type loosed to typed variables and functions. Imagine the reason you didn&#x27;t get your desired output, just because of &quot;1+1&#x3D;11&quot;. Ridiculous, right?

TypeScript infers a type quite smoothly — it&#x27;s a number. This fact allows developers to not write such types everywhere. TypeScript takes care of it. By the way, where will be another type in case of const usage. Try it by yourself. I&#x27;m waiting for your explanation in the comments. This is a small interactive with a reader)
