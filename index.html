                    <span>RxJS is a powerful library for reactive programming. We use it in Angular all the time, from simple reactions to HTTP client responses to full-blown state management solutions. But sometimes, it is easy to miss some details and create a code that can break at the worst possible moment. 
Let’s start with an example right away.
of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  .pipe(
    tap(v &#x3D;&gt; {
      if (v &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 3) {
        throw new Error(&#x27;some error&#x27;);
      }
    })
  )
  .subscribe({
    next: console.log.bind(null, &#x27;next:&#x27;),
    error: (err: Error) &#x3D;&gt; console.log(&#x27;error:&#x27;, err.message),
  });

We have an observable that emits numbers from 1 to 5, and if the number is 3, we throw an error.
We can see the following output.
next: 1
next: 2
error: some error

Numbers 4 and 5 were not processed at all.

Caph is the future of data storage whether it was objects, blocks or a file system. It provides a great alternative to self-hosted solutions such as GlusterFS in the realm of file systems and to managed services such as AWS S3 as an object storage where it makes more sense to host your own data because you have to store it on private cloud or simply to reduce costs as S3 costs sometimes grow to be pretty insane.
I used Vagrant to create a declarative configuration of my environment.
My setup consist of three virtual machines with Ubuntu 20.04 and attached disk storage of 10 GiB to each one of them (except the first machine it has two disks). Ceph documentation says the minimum disk size is 5 GiB but I had problems in the past working with storage less than 10 GiB so I wanted…</span>

                    <span>Let&#x27;s talk SSL and local development; don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;ve been searching too.
There is an issue with developing locally, not just with Laravel, where developers who are building saas products aren&#x27;t able to get a clean setup for SSL in the browser. This makes setting things up like PWAs or Google sign-in buttons impossible if the certificate isn&#x27;t valid.
Given the power of Docker and Caddy, the dream is real. You can absolutely use this for non-Laravel Sail web applications as well.
The end result of implementing the code below should give you a couple of certificates (intermediate.crt, laravel.test.crt) that you can install to your local system.

Dans ce tutoriel vagrant, je vais vous apprendre à configurer Vagrant sur votre ordinateur afin de créer et gérer des machines virtuelles pour votre environnement de développement.
Vagrant peut utiliser de nombreux providers de machines virtuelles tels que VirtualBox , VMware et Docker, mais à mon avis VirtualBox est le plus simple à utiliser et il est également l&#x27;option par défaut dans Vagrant.

If you have a Symfony/PHP application which needs to connect to AWS and use some of its services (S3, Secrets Manager,...) and you want to avoid pushing credentials to your Git repository or revealing them to any third party (ex. deployment, testing or code review tools), then follow this guide. 
This guide will show you how to quickly and safely integrate AWS authentication both on your local development environment and on the server, both on bare metal and by using Docker.
Note that this is all available on the official AWS Documentation portal... scattered across multiple pages and documentation sections and buried in walls of text.

Simply place the class somewhere in your JS load sequence after mootools itself, and call Fx.Scroll2 instead of Mootools own Fx.Scroll. Problem fixed. Hopefully the Mootools team will have this one resolved on their next update. Here is the class:

                    <span>Creating a javascript links that uses AJAX (or, more accurately, an asynchronous http request) to trigger a file download, usually results in disappointment. Headers returned by a PHP script called asynchronously do not trigger a download in the browser.
If you want to have a link to a file download that does not cause a page refresh or opening a superfluous browser window in order to make a file download happen, it&#x27;s actually quite easy with only a few lines of JS. There&#x27;s no &quot;AJAX&quot; here, but it sure feels like it. The method relies on adding an invisible iFrame to the DOM, and simply loading the script triggering the download into that iFrame:
[download a file]
if($(&#x27;download&#x27;)){
$filename &#x3D; &#x27;download.csv&#x27;;
//this is where you would format your data, selecting and looping through rows from your database for example.
//here we just output one line:
$out &#x3D; &quot;this, is, a , csv\n&quot;;
header(&quot;Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check&#x3D;0, pre-check&#x3D;0&quot;);
header(&quot;Content-Length: &quot; . strlen($out));
header(&quot;Content-type: text/x-csv&quot;);

                    <span>📣 The world is amazing ,but Not so ideal as we think!🤔
💡 Unix-like operating systems such as Linux do not have an undelete command.
When we delete something with rm , it&#x27;s gone.Linux assumes we&#x27;re smart and we know what we&#x27;re doing.

One of the big problem can cause wildcards. so be particularly with them.
For Example : if we want to delete just the JS files in directory we type:
rm *.js
* and the .js like so:
rm * .js
.js
There is many ways to avoid this problem, here is 2 useful tip: 
-i (interactive) option, which prompt the user for confirmation  ,before deleting an existing file.
rm i *.js
rm: remove regular empty file &#x27;mk.js&#x27;?
2 - whenever we use wildcards with rm, test the wildcard first with ls. This will let we see the files that will be deleted. Then we can press the up arrow ☝️ to recall the command and replace ls with rm.</span>

                    <span>What is Linux?
This series is not only for hackers but also for all beginners who are interested in Linux. By the way, if you want to become a hacker,

Hold on, If you read this…
Let me know why are you here in the comment box… Just put why you are interested in Linux, why you want to learn Linux? okay, you put… fine!!! Perfect! Thank you! Let’s move on…

Okay, First of all, you need to install Linux OS on your machine…
Otherwise, I recommended using a Virtual Machine. Oracle Virtual Box is pretty much cooler and easy to use. But It’s all your choice.
What you want to do is, Install and run Kali/ubuntu/Parrot or any Linux distro on your virtual machine or your alternative device!!!

So this is Linux. I put the screenshot of a Kali Linux Distro. This is specifically optimized for Cyber Secu…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Caph is the future of data storage whether it was objects, blocks or a file system. It provides a great alternative to self-hosted solutions such as GlusterFS in the realm of file systems and to managed services such as AWS S3 as an object storage where it makes more sense to host your own data because you have to store it on private cloud or simply to reduce costs as S3 costs sometimes grow to be pretty insane.
I used Vagrant to create a declarative configuration of my environment.
My setup consist of three virtual machines with Ubuntu 20.04 and attached disk storage of 10 GiB to each one of them (except the first machine it has two disks). Ceph documentation says the minimum disk size is 5 GiB but I had problems in the past working with storage less than 10 GiB so I wanted…</span>

                    <span>For some reasons, I want to monitor the power usage of my M1 MacBook Air. The quickest way to grab power related system information directly from the macOS Terminal is actually using the powermetrics command. However, printing out the results on screen doesn’t meet my monitoring requirements, therefore, I try to think of a better solution to store and visualise the data.
After a quick search on Google, I decided to use InfluxDB as my Time-Series Database to record the power usage signal because it provides an easy-to-use and easy-to-configure dashboard feature.

                    <span>In this artical we will learn How to send emails using Gmail and NodeJS
Nodemailer:
Sending emails is a common feature that is present in many applications. This feature is used to notify user about news, like a newsletter, about your product status when it’s facing to an issue, recovery password and so on.
Step 1: Installing the nodemailer.
Step 2: Connecting with the Gmail
// create reusable transporter object using the default SMTP transport
let transporter &#x3D; nodemailer.createTransport({ service: &#x27;gmail&#x27;, auth: { user: youremail@gmail.com, pass: youremail password, }, });
Step 3: Configure Gmail account to accept less secure apps
To enable it you need to go to https://myaccount.google.com/ and select your Google Account. Then go to Security in the left sidebar and search by “Less secure app access”.
step 4: Definitely sending emails.
transporter.sendMail({ from: &#x27;&quot;Your Name&quot; youremail@gmail.com&#x27;, // sender address to: &quot;receiverone@gmail.com, receivertwo@outlook.com&quot;, // list of receivers subject: &quot;Medium @edigleyssonsilva ✔&quot;, // Subject line text: &quot;There is a new article. It&#x27;s about sending emails, check it out!&quot;, // plain text body html: &quot;There is a new article. It&#x27;s about sending emails, check it out!&quot;, // html body }) .then(info &#x3D;&gt; { console.log({info}); }) .catch(console.error);
Note that in the createTransport we only pass an attribute called service where we define it asgmail and the auth with our credentials.
{ info: { accepted: [ &#x27;receiver@gmail.com&#x27; ], rejected: [], envelopeTime: 871, messageTime: 651, messageSize: 747, response: &#x27;250 2.0.0 OK 1615152446 m6sm5222884qtx.3 - gsmtp&#x27;, envelope: { from: &#x27;fromemail@gmail.com&#x27;, to: [Array] }, messageId: &#x27;95e9c9a0-9c20-fcda-1873-7f16aec2b293@gmail.com&#x27; } }</span>

                    <span>Recently I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time writing Haskell. In Haskell-land there&#x27;s a lot of bleeding-edge research stuff, which is cool, but most likely not very applicable for my day-to-day work. If there&#x27;s one thing that all haskellers love, it must be type-safety. That&#x27;s what this post is about, bringing some type-safety to our node.js apps, more specifically express or koa apps. I&#x27;ll try to point to some flaws I see in the typical way of writing express/koa apps with typescript and propose a &quot;better&quot; way.
Let&#x27;s start by defining routes we would like to implement. Suppose you are writing some CRUD operations for some &quot;users&quot; resource. We will use the following endpoint schema as an example.
GET /users     &#x3D;&gt; Ok
GET /users/:id &#x3D;&gt; Ok | NotFound
POST /users    &#x3D;&gt; Ok | BadRequest

                    <span>How to manage your Node.js version on Replit



First, go to Replit and create a REPL. Select BASH and NOT Node.js (We&#x27;ll install it later). Funnily enough, at the time of writing, if you ran node -v, you would see v14.17.1 (which is an LTS version, and also considering we didn&#x27;t install Node).
Select Shell (which is just beside Console)
Copy and paste the following code below into Shell. On Windows, it&#x27;s Ctrl+Shift+V. You can change the 16 below to any version you desire.




  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash
  export NVM_DIR&#x3D;&quot;/config/nvm&quot;
  [ -s &quot;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh&quot; ] &amp;&amp; \. &quot;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh&quot;  # This loads nvm
  [ -s &quot;$NVM_DIR/bash_completion&quot; ] &amp;&amp; \. &quot;$NVM_DIR/bash_completion&quot;  # This loads nvm bash_completion
  nvm install 16 
  nvm use 16

Wait for a while. You may choose to go to the toilet or grab a few bites in the meantime.
After the code below has finished running and installing Node.js, run node -v &amp;&amp; npm -v. You should see an updated Node.js (v16.x.x) and NPM (v8.x.x at time of writing) version. 
Run the following to test:




 echo console.log(&#x60;Node version: ${process.versions.node}&#x60;) &gt; test.js
 node test.js

You should now see an updated/different Node version, depending on which version you installed and used earlier on.
That&#x27;s it! You can now install and use any Node.js version you wish!

                    <span>Sabe aquele servidor solitário ou então que a aplicação só roda em um IaaS? 
É muito provável que as atualizações tenham ficado um pouco de lado (leia-se nunca feito) e chega um momento que será necessário fazer a atualização, nesse momento bate aquele medo de atualizar e quebrar algo, não é?.
O que podemos fazer é atualizar o mínimo necessário (e rezar), normalmente só atualizar o que representa um problema de segurança.
Para nos ajudar podemos utilizar a flag --security na execução do yum.
Antes de começarmos vamos olhar uma saída padrão de um yum update, repare na quantidade de pacotes que serão instalados (10) e atualizados (96)

1 – Garante que o pacote yum-plugin-security esteja instalado:
# yum -y install yum-plugin-security

2 - Você pode listar todas as atualizações de segurança disponíveis com o seguinte comando:
# yum --security check-update

3 – Agora vamos fazer a instalação somente as atualizações de segurança com o menor update possível
# yum --security update-minimal

Compare com a primeira imagem, agora serão instalados (7) e atualizados (50).

Dica extra.
Precisa fazer isso em vários servidores? Utilize o Ansible, com o parâmetro security: yes, para isso :)
- name: Upgrade all packages
  yum:
    name: &#x27;*&#x27;
    state: latest
    security: yes</span>

For this use-case, React Query offers the useMutation hook.
Generally speaking, mutations are functions that have a side effect. As an example, have a look at the push method of Arrays: It has the side effect of changing the array in place where you&#x27;re pushing a value to:
const myArray &#x3D; [1]
myArray.push(2)

console.log(myArray) // [1, 2]

The immutable counterpart would be concat, which can also add values to an array, but it will return a new Array instead of directly manipulating the Array you operate on:
const myArray &#x3D; [1]
const newArray &#x3D; myArra…</span>

                    <span>I  am sure that in your web development career you must have used JavaScript at least once. And I am sure you must have found it very useful and very powerful. But what if I say there is another language that is just as powerful as JavaScript and has way lesser bugs when compared to when you use JavaScript in your app.
That language is TypeScript.
What is TypeScript?
If you know JavaScript, it mustn&#x27;t be a problem switching to TypeScript as it essentially has the same concepts as JavaScript except a few of TypeScript&#x27;s own concepts.
So what are the advantages of using TypeScript?
Concepts similar to JavaScript


TypeScript is type-safe


It keeps JavaScript in check


Runs on multiple places


Type Inference


It is developed and maintained by Microsoft



Let&#x27;s move on to some testimonials!
TypeScript is widely used and loved by developers around the world. Here are some testimonials given by popular companies which is another indication that switching to TypeScript is worth it.
According to Slack, the switch to TypeScript made their life a lot easier in terms of bug-fixing and productivity. They also said Static Analysis which analyzes your code and tries to infer types and warns the developer in advance before the code even runs.


According to Airbnb, TypeScript prevented 38% of the bugs based on their analysis.



TypeScript lets developers be productive and safe at the same time.
In StackOverflow&#x27;s developer survey in 2020, TypeScript was declared to be the 2nd most loved programming language

                    <span>Straight to the Code


There&#x27;s an example repository scaffolded with create-react-app which I&#x27;ve created for this post. Probably of most interest is the component FancyTitle which uses the default props pattern discussed in this blog post.
Now let&#x27;s get into the details of the pattern.
When using TypeScript with React, it&#x27;s easy enough to define optional props. With your props interface, you simply apply the optional parameter symbol ?:
interface IMyComponentRequiredProps {
  someRequiredProp: string;
  someOptionalProp?: string;
}

But what if we want default values for our optional props in the case when they are not specified? 
A rather elegant way to do it is to define two separate interfaces, one for the required props, and one for the optional props. For example, if our component is …</span>

                    <span>Building (and maintaining) an acquisition funnel is something that most development teams will be asked to do at some point. This is no small task as this funnel will often be the  main entry point to the company products or services. This means that such a funnel needs to be completely reliable to avoid losing customers to bugs, and fully flexible to allow the marketing team to optimize the conversion rate. 
In this two-part article we&#x27;ll see how to accomplish that easily by using a strong programming pattern: a Finite State Machine. We&#x27;ll be using React and Xstate for the implementation, but the principles can be applied to any stack really.

An API which we don&#x27;t own can return an object containing the same property, with a suffix going from 1 to 3. Example:
interface Order {
  // some unique keys
  id: string;
  name: string;

  // some keys &quot;grouped&quot; by 3 
  price1: number;
  price2: number;
  price3: number;

  quantity1: number;
  quantity2: number;
  quantity3: number;

  shippingDate1: string;
  shippingDate2: string;
  shippingDate3: string;
}

Notes:
Why is that API not exposing prices, quantities and shippingDates as arrays is beyond the point here. Let&#x27;s just assume we consume an API that we cannot modify
This is just an example and the returned type could have way more properties like that, so we don&#x27;t want to have to make the whole remapping manually

In Haskell-land there&#x27;s a lot of bleeding-edge research stuff, which is cool, but most likely not very applicable for my day-to-day work. If there&#x27;s one thing that all haskellers love, it must be type-safety. That&#x27;s what this post is about, bringing some type-safety to our node.js apps, more specifically express or koa apps. I&#x27;ll try to point to some flaws I see in the typical way of writing express/koa apps with typescript and propose a &quot;better&quot; way.
Let&#x27;s start by defining routes we would like to implement. Suppose you are writing some CRUD operations for some &quot;users&quot; resource. We will use the following endpoint schema as an example.

Lazy Loading is the design pattern which delays the loading or initialization of objects or resources until they are required. This improves performance drastically. In the case of React, the reduced bundle size leads to faster initial load time, which is crucial these days with dwindling attention span.
Luckily for us, React makes implementing Lazy Loading very easy for developers. All you need to do is wrap dynamic import statement import() with React.lazy.

This is my first time participating Hacktoberfest and I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect.

So I wanted to start with something maybe smaller and work my way up to a larger project I am interested in.
It felt a lot harder to find something simple than I expected it to be, there were a lot of cool projects that looked very complicated and I wasn&#x27;t really sure how to solve their issues.

Praticamente todos os navegadores mantêm um cache da aplicação no computador do cliente para conseguir carregar a aplicação de forma mais rápida e com menor consumo de dados e isso é excelente. Entretanto, um efeito colateral é que as atualizações podem demorar para serem entregues para o cliente. Como consequência, o cliente pode ficar horas ou dias com uma versão com um bug que já foi corrigido.
Em sistemas internos de empresas, isso pode resultar em ligações ou tickets constantes para a equipe de suporte técnico, causando uma sobrecarga na equipe. Quando estamos falando de aplicações fornecidas para clientes externos à empresa, pode ser um ponto de frustração e insatisfação com o produto.

Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
ngx-spinner is a loading (spinner) component library with more than 50 different types.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)

ng new angular-spinner
? Would you like to add Angular routing? Yes
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? SCSS   [ https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss                ]

Create, Read, Update, and Delete 👉 CRUD
Starting from the acronym, CRUD means create, read, update, and delete. These are the four main functionalities that must be provided by all models when building APIs.

                    <span>Angular has the concept of services which allows to share the data between components.
In this blog we will learn about service instances creation in Angular.
What happens when we inject service in root of a lazy module, is the same instance used for multiple lazy modules.
What if we want to have a separate instance per module and per component ?
We will use the same code example as used in common chunks example. If you haven&#x27;t gone through that blog do checkout to learn on why common chunks are created.
Let&#x27;s begin then.
Let&#x27;s start where we ended in the previous post. We have two lazy modules user and account and currently share the same toast module which is built in a separate chunk.
As we have given as @Injectable({ providedIn: &quot;root&quot; }) for the toast service, a singleton instance of …</span>

                    <span>What is Wordpress?


WordPress is the simplest, most popular way to create your own website or blog. In fact, WordPress powers over 40.0% of all the websites on the Internet. Yes – more than one in four websites that you visit are likely powered by WordPress!
To begin go to the AWS Control Panel and find the search bar. 
Lightsail and click the first service. Now you should see something like the following:

Create instance. Now scroll down and you will see Lightsail by default selected Wordpress. 
$5/month deal. Name your instance and then press the big button saying Create instance. Now wait 3 minutes for your VM (Instance) to load up. To know it is loaded up you will see the Wordpress icon blue and not gray. 
13.59.157.149. Once copied go to your broswer and paste it in with the following line:
13.59.157.149/wp-admin

You should see the following:

user is user but to find the password we need to go back to the terminal.
cat bitnami_application_password

Select the output and paste it into the password. Once you logged in you are done! You should see the following once logged in:

The goal is to create an application that will implement CRUD operations in Node.js using the Express.js framework and SQLite database, using the MVC design pattern. It will be a simple To Do List Application in which the user can Create, Read, Update and Delete a task.
The application is available on the following link To Do Application, and the complete code is available on the GitHub repository.
Getting started
Template engine
Routes
Database
MVC architectural pattern
More setup
Create task
Delete and update task
Data validation
Conclusion
The first step is to create a new directory and initialize the project using a terminal.

I have a beginner friendly backend requirement. 
It will be simple CRUD of three resources.


Data will be stored to DynamoDB.


For language, you can use golang or node.


All code you write will be open source under GPL.

Node.js is lightweight when contrasted with different adversaries that make it very proficient for the advancement of information escalated huge scope applications, for example, video web-based locales, and other web applications. 

Node.js is very like Ruby&#x27;s EventMachine and Python&#x27;s Twisted yet a stride in front of them. It has an occasion-driven design that has the ability of nonconcurrent I/O tasks, which makes it equipped for dealing with numerous simultaneous solicitations.

This is a pretty common requirement even for food or hotel business-related websites.
So in this article, we will see how to add a google map with the preferred location on your website.
Create a new folder with the name google-map-location-demo and create an index.html file inside it. Now, type ! (exclamation mark) in the file and press tab, so the default HTML code will automatically be added by emmet.
If you&#x27;re not aware of emmet and its useful shortcuts, check out my this article.

You can change the title tag content as per your choice.
For this demo, we will show the Eiffel tower&#x27;s location on the map.
So follow the below steps.
Navigate to https://maps.google.com/ and search for Eiffel Tower in the search box
Now, click on the Share icon and select the Embed a map option
Click on the COPY HTML button to copy the iframe tag into your clipboard
Now, open the index.html file, and inside the body tag, add the copied content

Now, If you open the file in the browser, you will see the map displayed

                    <span>What are Bugs?
A software bug is an error in a computer program that causes it to produce unexpected results or to behave in a disruptive fashion.
Albeit a bug can be a very innocent flaw, a careless mistake the impact it can have can still be exponentially larger than an exploit due to a big logical error in a code base.
eg. a small rounding error in the calculation of an orbit of a satellite can cause major financial damages with many other implications like space pollution.
Hence, every developer should be aware of basic cybersecurity practices!

                    <span>Introduction


When you start working as an application security engineer, you&#x27;ll expect to find straightforward tasks to do. But this is not the case because each company has its vision and strategies to handle data security, which can let us infer that every organization&#x27;s security maturity may differ from one to another.
Viewing data breaches and cyber incidents all the time proves that no one out there has a mature cyber security program.
If you are already working in this field, I imagine that you sometimes feel that you&#x27;re achieving nothing and you are more invisible inside the organization. The bigest challenge I see is how to increase your visibility and have more transparency with your manager and the rest of your co-workers.

                    <span>A security operations center, known as a SOC – pronounced “sock” 🧦 - is a team of experts that proactively monitor an organization’s ability to operate securely.
Members of a SOC team are responsible for a variety of activities, including proactive monitoring, incident response and recovery, remediation activities, compliance, and coordination and context.
Proactive Monitoring
Incident Response and Recovery
For example, that recovery can include activities such as handling acute malware or ransomware incidents. 
Remediation Activities 
For Example, using information obtained from log files and other sources, a SOC member can recommend a better network segmentation strategy or a better system patching regimen. Improving existing CyberSecurity is a major responsibility of a SOC. 
Compliance
Organisation secure themselves through conformity to a security policy, as well as external security standards, such as ISO 27001x, the NIST CyberSecurity Framework(CSF) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Organisations need a SOC to help ensure that they are compliant with an important security standards and best practices. 
Coordination and Context
Above all, a SOC team member helps an organisation coordinate desperate elements and services and provide visualized, useful information. Part of this coordination is the ability to provide a helpful, useful set of narratives for activities on the network. These narratives help shape a company&#x27;s CyberSecurity policy and posture for the future.</span>

There’s a repository with the code so that you can follow along in Github.
I didn’t explain what I mean by securing an API yet. Essentially, we’re ensuring that protected routes are accessible only for the users with enough rights.

A linked list is a linear data structure that represents a collection of elements that we&#x27;ll call nodes , where each node points to the next one or previous one, the first node in the linked list is the head and the last is the tail

In the linked list each node must be have the following properties:
The main properties of the linked list are:
Size: The number of nodes in the linked list 
Head: The first node
Tail: The last node
and the main operations of a linked list data structure are: 
insertAt: Inserts a node at the specific index.


removeAt: Removes the node at the specific index.


getAt: Retrieves the element at the specific index.


Clear: Empties the linked list


Reverse(in this case): Reverses the order of nodes in the linked list

                    <span>I love that my job has me learning a new thing ( or two :) ) every day. This time it was exporting table data to a .csv file that could therefore be used whichever way needed. Of course, there are many ways to go about this.
Lets set the project in view here: 
Now to figure out how to approach it. 
As I was figuring out how I wanted to work on this, my mind was on simple and to the point as we just want to create the file client-side. I found https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-saver to which suits my needs. Now all that&#x27;s left is to implement the exportCSV function. 
In my typescript file,  I added the following:
 exportFile(data: any) {
    const replacer &#x3D; (key, value) &#x3D;&gt; value &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; null ? &#x27;&#x27; : value;

Reactive Extensions of JavaScript is a library for reactive programming. It is commonly known for its operators. The RxJS Operators are also known as Observable Operators.
What are Operators?
Operators are pure functions. They take observable as input and return output as observable.
map– a transformation operator works similar to Array.prototype.map
switchMap– cancels the inner observable when outer observable emits a value
catchError– catches the error and passes to error handling function
debounceTime– discards values if emitted in less than specified time
takeUntil– automatically unsubscribes from an observable
distinctUntilChanged– emits only distinct values and duplicate…</span>

RxJS is Reactive Extensions of JavaScript. It is a library to work with Observables which make developers life easier. RxJS provides various operators to work with in Angular. In this article we will discuss about RxJS Observable forkJoin operator, its definition, real world uses, error handling, is it deprecated etc.
What is RxJS forkJoin
Is it deprecated ?
I will explain what I mean!
Initially forkJoin was accepting object arguments as rest parameter. That is deprecated and no longer used.
Now they updated the operator and ask to provide array of observables instead of object arguments. As the line itself saying in above screenshot- @deprecated

                    <span>My, since a little while beautiful, app called What?! was a little slow when opening files. A lot slower since the version before the big redesign. When you changed a lot it is hard to find a starting point. What you can do about this? You already read the title so you know the answer. Tldr; just try it.
The console.log() function is something most JS developers know, you can output anything to the console (for Node as well as the browser). I think a lot of developers do not know about console.time() though. Probably something you will use a lot less, but can be very useful.
Okay, so let’s find that slow little bastard of a function. What you need to know:
console.time(‘example’) will start a timer, where you also give it a name. You can start multiple timers (simultaneously), if choose di…</span>

Batizada de Mariana Trench (MT) e distribuida de forma Open Source a ferramenta está em constante evolução e suporte pelo time de engenharia do Facebook. Ela é usada hoje em milhões de linhas de código no Whatsapp, Instagram e, claro, no próprio app do Facebook. Segundo o Facebook, na primeira metade de 2021, 50% das vulnerabilidades encontradas foram de forma automatizada.
O MT foi desenvolvido em Python e roda de forma estática no código. Está disponível (aqui)[https://github.com/facebook/mariana-trench/). O Facebook também deixou pronto um tutorial para facilitar nos primeiros passos. O tutorial pode ser acessado (aqui)[https://mariana-tren.ch/docs/getting-started/].</span>

                    <span>Part I of the series described the filesystem layout and how the runtime jails the container process inside the root filesystem of the container.
Part 0 briefly explained the clone syscall. It&#x27;s like fork/vfork, but with more options to control the child process. Actually, some implementations of fork propagate the call to clone().
Besides controlling which parts of the execution context get shared from the parent process, the clone call offers the possibility for us to create a separate memory block for the child&#x27;s stack. The nix implementation of clone has the following signature:
pub fn clone(
 cb: CloneCb, 
 stack: &amp;mut [u8], 
 flags: CloneFlags, 
 signal: Option
) -&gt; Result

The signal argument, if specified, is sent back to the parent when the child process terminates…</span>

                    <span>Introduction to Docker





It is more likely than not that Docker and containers are going to be part of your IT career in one way or another.
In this blog post series I&#x27;ll cover the following:
  What are Docker images, containers and Docker Hub
  Installing Docker on Ubuntu Linux on a DigitalOcean Droplet
  Working with Docker containers
  Working with Docker images
  Deploying a Dockerized app
I&#x27;ll be using DigitalOcean for all of the demos, so I would strongly encourage you to create a DigitalOcean account follow along. You would learn more by doing!
To make things even better you can use my referral link to get a free $100 credit that you could use to deploy your virtual machines and test the guide yourself on a few DigitalOcean servers:
