I was working with React Projects for a long time. I have evolved a mindset that allows you to abuse HOC to make code more reusable and somewhat clean. But when I got into Angular, it felt weird at first that there is no such concept.
At some point, I got in touch with Modals and there it was the gong that awoke the ninja in me. First, I dove again into angular.io docs and indeed found a way to pass components through @Input() and render them. But that was unsatisfying because of the decorator. ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>I have just recently improved my terminal setup after learning how to use Tmux. It gave me a way to move faster between projects and even kept my session saved after machine shutdowns. My goal here is to help you configure a environment that will be both beautiful and functional. Let&#x27;s get to it.
Guake: top-down terminal that can be instantaneously opened with a keystroke.
Zsh: an extended Bourne Shell (sh) with many improvements, powerful command line editing options, and support for plugins and themes.

                    <span>In recent years phone screens seem to only have gotten bigger. This is great because it allows you to see more on your screen, but it also has some drawbacks. One of them has been very annoying to me: I can no longer reach buttons at the top left of the screen in a comfortable way.
In a way, I would divide the screen in three areas:
Easy to reach: the area can be reached with the thumb while holding the phone.
