                    <span>Today in this digital era developing a web application requires a reliable and dependable software stack. Modern-day developers are utilizing a blend of advanced technologies to get swifter and enhanced outcomes through their projects.
Increasing the use of MEAN Stack is one of the primary examples of this scenario. MEAN JS is utilized to craft robust and scalable web applications. Let’s explore what exactly is Mean Stack and how it can assist your business.
What is the MEAN stack?
Mean stack is the compilation and synergy of technologies applied to build web applications. MEAN is used by several Web App Development Companies, and it precisely stands for “MongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js.”
How does Mean stack architecture work?

The Mean Stack Architecture works in five stages.
Stage 1: Angular as a client-side language is the foremost one to work on the client request.
Stage 2: The client request then goes into NodeJS being the JavaScript server-side language.
Stage 3: ExpressJS is then into the process and makes a database request.
Stage 4: Then MongoDB retrieves the data and sends the response to ExpressJS.
Stage 5: NodeJS returns the data to the AngularJS to showcase the outcomes, and in return, the data is taken back from the ExpressJS.

This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating your Angular application using Routers. We&#x27;ll learn the basics of Router outlets, navigations, routes, and paths to generate a complete Angular Single Page Application (SPA).  
For you to be able to follow this tutorial along, it&#x27;ll be a necessity to have basic knowledge of Angular.
Angular Router is a core part of Angular that aids in building a single-page application. It&#x27;s located in the @angular/router package.  
It has a complete routing library for constructing multiple route outlets. It also supports several features such as lazy loading and routing guards for access control et cetera.
Routes are objects. At the lowest level, they comprise Angular components and paths, and sometimes redirectTo. This provides …</span>

                    <span>Welcome to the weird notes of a new DevOps and Backend engineer. This is my (quite open) notebook on what was all the stuff I read and learnt. Not necessarily tech, you can just read on and understand what I am rambling on about.
So, the current opentelemetry sentry-exporter is indeed incomplete right now. I investigated the elastic APM exporter and realised that Sentry one is just not using it&#x27;s full capabilities yet. You need to run span.Events() to get a list of events which can be further converted into *sentry.Event.


Also, in the prometheus-operator helm chart, we figured out how to add additional rules without having to &quot;upgrade the chart&quot; without putting in new values in values.yaml. Just create a new PrometheusRule object as a rule file and the ConfigMaps will auto grab it.
PS: I am talking about this operator here : kube-prometheus




  
  
  Stuff I need to check out tomorrow? 📅



How do i link a sentry span and a sentry issue.
Talk with team and refine the requirements because hell no, Sentry is not a logging platform (or I am an idiot)
Get vaccinated ffs 😢
IF I manage to pull this issue linking stuff off, I think I will contribute this to opentelemetry collector exporter. My first cloud native contribution might be on its way idk man.
Thanks for listening to the rant.

                    <span>Creating production-ready containers for use in commercial-grade apps can be a far cry from the &quot;get started with Node.js and Docker&quot;-type of tutorials that are common around the Internet. Those guides are great for introducing all the advantages of Docker containers in modern cloud-native development, but creating a container that passes muster in a large-scale application in production is a different story. 
For production-ready containers, there are three key things you want to optimise for when creating a container:
Image Size 📦
Build Speed 🐢
Security 🔐
Image size and build speed ensure that your containers can move through CI/CD and test pipelines easily and efficiently. Security is obviously critical in today&#x27;s software supply chain, and containers have their own set of security i…</span>

Whether you&#x27;ve been working with Azure for some time, or only recently started - You will have likely heard of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates.
Let&#x27;s do a brief level-set, just in case you haven&#x27;t heard of ARM templates! ARM Templates are a type of Infrastructure as Code. They allow you to define your Azure Infrastructure using code in a declarative way. Rather than saying how you want things to be created (e.g. Azure CLI/PowerShell), you specify what you want to be created. Azure then &#x27;makes it happen&#x27;.
Azure Resource Manager hasn&#x27;t always been a part of Azure though. …</span>

                    <span>In this post I&#x27;m going to show you how to disable a repository in Azure DevOps and prevent users from accessing its contents.
As usual, if you are a visual learner, or simply prefer to watch and listen instead of reading, here you have the video with the whole explanation and demo, which to be fair is much more complete than this post.

If you rather prefer reading, well... let&#x27;s just continue :)
Before we talk about how to disable a repo, why would you want to do it?
Well, for example you may want to disable a repository because you found a secret in it. Or a third-party scanning tool found the repository to be out of compliance.
In such cases, you may want to temporarily disable the repository while you work to resolve the issue.
Let&#x27;s see now how to disable a repo. It is very easy.
Just go to the Project Settings, scroll down to the Repositories section and enter it, then click on the specific repo you want to Disable. In the settings, you have the Disable Repo switch

When a repo is disabled, it still shows up in the list of repos, however no one can access or update its content.
And you would also see a message saying that the repo has been disabled when they try to access it in the Azure Repos UI.

And of course after the necessary mitigation steps have been taken, disabled repositories can be re-enabled using the same setting.
Final note: you can disable a repository only if you are either admin or owner, or you have the Delete repository permissions.
Let me know in the comment section below if you think this is useful and if you&#x27;ve ever been in a situation in which you could have disabled a repo.

                    <span>Creating production-ready containers for use in commercial-grade apps can be a far cry from the &quot;get started with Node.js and Docker&quot;-type of tutorials that are common around the Internet. Those guides are great for introducing all the advantages of Docker containers in modern cloud-native development, but creating a container that passes muster in a large-scale application in production is a different story. 
For production-ready containers, there are three key things you want to optimise for when creating a container:
Image Size 📦
Build Speed 🐢
Security 🔐
Image size and build speed ensure that your containers can move through CI/CD and test pipelines easily and efficiently. Security is obviously critical in today&#x27;s software supply chain, and containers have their own set of security i…</span>

                    <span>There are many tools like Docker, Vagrant, VirtualBox, etc. that gives you the power to achieve the multiple versions of PHP in your system. But I want to stay away as much as possible from third-party tools and try to leverage the native as much as I can.
So want to learn how to install multiple versions of PHP on the Ubuntu system? Okay, that’s great.
Let’s assume, you have
OS: Ubuntu 16.04
PHP: 7.1 (PHP-FPM)
Nginx: 1.10
And want to install PHP 7.2.
Run the following commands to update the PHP repository &amp; the Ubuntu system
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt update

Now you are able to install the new version of PHP
sudo apt install -y php7.2-fpm
sudo apt install -y php7.2-dev
php -v

If php -v still pointing to the old PHP version…</span>

                    <span>What are &quot;Callbacks&quot;?


A callback function is usually used as a parameter to another function.
The function that receives callback function is normally fetching data from a database, making an API request, downloading a file, which usually takes a while.
Assume getting some data from the API and the request takes around 2 seconds to complete. 

Now, you can either wait for the API call to complete and then display your UI,
OR, you show everything else and show a loader where the API data needs to be shown.
In the API function, we pass some sort of &quot;call back&quot; function that replaces loader with actual data, so once the response is received from API
It calls the callback function with the data and, then our callback function replaces the loader.
Let&#x27;s see this in action:

                    <span>In this short article, we are going to see how we can handle error in JavaScript in Golang style.
I am assuming, you have some experience with JavaScript and you are aware of the issues with error handling like throwing an exception to the parent method from try-catch block or chaining multiple then-blocks and implementing logic inside it. These things can easily mess up with the code making it difficult to read.
Golang avoids these type of problems by handling errors/exceptions atomically.
result, err :&#x3D; methodCall()
if err !&#x3D; nil {
  // handle error
}
// do something with the result

We can use a similar pattern in JavaScript with the help of a try-catch block like this.
const getData &#x3D; async () &#x3D;&gt; {
  try {
    const result &#x3D; await methodCall();
    return [result, null];
  } catch(error) {
    return [null, error];
  }
}

If any error occurs, we are returning the error in the second position of the array and the result as null in the first position.
If there is no error, we are returning the result in the first position and error as null in the second position.
Now we can call the getData method then handle the result and error like this.
const [result, error] &#x3D; await getData();
if (error !&#x3D;&#x3D; null) {
  // handle the error
}
// do something with the result

This pattern of error handling makes it very easy to read and understand the code.
Let me know what do you think about this pattern.

I had built many small react projects and One MERN stack app but not myself, by following courses, So you can understand, that without getting hand dirty, you will not get confidence in coding, there will be more self-doubt always in my heart. So decided to make a project by myself to remove that doubt from my heart. But now I am not able to decide on what project I can work on. So I am here to get help from my fellas. Can anybody tell me on which MERN project I have to work on. There are many experience coders here, So please give me some ideas to work on.</span>

                    <span>Sending an outbound message using the Plivo SMS platform is easy, but communication should be a two-way street. Customers should be able to text you, and you should acknowledge their messages and address their concerns. To do this, you can build a Node Expressjs application to receive and respond to incoming SMS messages on a Plivo phone number. In this post, we walk you through how to implement this.
Before you get started, you’ll need:
  A Plivo account — sign up for one for free if you don’t have one already.
  An SMS-enabled Plivo phone number as you want to receive incoming SMS messages. To search for and buy an available number, go to Phone Numbers &gt; Buy Numbers on the Plivo console.
  Expressjs and Plivo npm packages — run npm i -S plivo express body-parser to install them.

                    <span>If you want to build projects efficiently, then this concept is for you.
The theory of async JavaScript helps you break down big complex projects into smaller tasks.
Then you can use any of these three techniques – callbacks, promises or Async/await – to run those small tasks in a way that you get the best results.
Let&#x27;s dive in!🎖️

In a synchronous system, tasks are completed one after another.
Think of this as if you have just one hand to accomplish 10 tasks. So, you have to complete one task at a time.
Take a look at the GIF 👇 – one thing is happening at a time here:

                    <span>Today in this digital era developing a web application requires a reliable and dependable software stack. Modern-day developers are utilizing a blend of advanced technologies to get swifter and enhanced outcomes through their projects.
Increasing the use of MEAN Stack is one of the primary examples of this scenario. MEAN JS is utilized to craft robust and scalable web applications. Let’s explore what exactly is Mean Stack and how it can assist your business.
What is the MEAN stack?
Mean stack is the compilation and synergy of technologies applied to build web applications. MEAN is used by several Web App Development Companies, and it precisely stands for “MongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js.”
How does Mean stack architecture work?

The Mean Stack Architecture works in five stages.
Stage 1: Angular as a client-side language is the foremost one to work on the client request.
Stage 2: The client request then goes into NodeJS being the JavaScript server-side language.
Stage 3: ExpressJS is then into the process and makes a database request.
Stage 4: Then MongoDB retrieves the data and sends the response to ExpressJS.
Stage 5: NodeJS returns the data to the AngularJS to showcase the outcomes, and in return, the data is taken back from the ExpressJS.

                    <span>Several years ago when I decided to write an article, I got this inject-env-variables-with-no-tears. At that time, I know nothing about makefile and shell script(almost), the only idea in my brain is just Nodejs. Years later, I got new and better solutions.
Firstly, let&#x27;s talk about what env variables act in software like a project written in Nodejs. Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s an app that is bootstrapped by create-react-app. By default, this app will be served on the root path of a host, like medium.com. If it&#x27;s supposed to be served on a sub-path like /apps/my-app, you have to tell the build script what the exact path it is. The way it receives the path value is through the env variable, actually as PUBLIC_URL.
Now, let talk about how to inject env variables into the project.

                    <span>While working on a backend service, I came across this problem where I had to retrieve a set of data of a specific type, but that type wasn&#x27;t having any index and the data was also updated frequently.
Since the data was constantly changing (add/update), first thing that came to my mind was to have a trigger but then as I looked at the documentation of how to add triggers to Dynamo in AWS, I decided to pursue a different solution :p
So, there were three easy solutions that were present before me without thinking much - 
→  Complete scan of the table and filter the results
→ Add an Index for that type
There were couple of reasons I didn&#x27;t go along with this idea
That wasn&#x27;t a very frequently queried data
Already had so many indexes so didn&#x27;t want to add one more just yet before trying other solutions
→  Run a cron-job 
Great man once said, If you can&#x27;t think of anything else, run a cron-job.
Back in my mind, I wasn&#x27;t quite convinced with any of the above three solutions and so decided to give dynamodb triggers try. I was aware of DynamoDb streams but never tried them.
DynamoDB Streams are basically triggers like that we have in Relational DBs but the only difference is that it generates stream of events when there is a data change and you can easily pipe that stream into Kinesis or a Lambda (In my case it was lambda).

AWS made the things look difficult but the process was not complex at all. 
All I had to do was the following -
Setup a stream on the dynamodb table which was just a one click action.
Create a new lambda function and attach it to the dynamodb stream which was also fairly easy
Rest was basic stuff of listening the data then processing it and finally saving it to the new table
DynamoDB streams are much more than what I have covered in my use case. You can read more about it here : -https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/dynamodb-streams-use-cases-and-design-patterns/</span>

                    <span>In most of the applications, we need to display a formatted date like 18 June 2021 or 06/18/2021 along with the time.
So we normally use moment.js or date-fns or day.js library to get that done.
But using an external library adds a lot of extra code to the final size of the application.
For example, the moment.js npm library is about 4.21MB in unpacked size.

So even If you use it only once for single formatting, your final application bundle size will increase which will affect your application loading time.
Also, Moment.js is now a legacy project(in maintenance mode) from Oct 2020.
So in this article, we&#x27;ll see how to display the date in a formatted way using just JavaScript without using any external libraries. 
So let&#x27;s get started.

This week it&#x27;s all about security.
Apple: WebKit Bugs Exploited to Hack Older iPhones


Earlier in this series, we covered the WebKit bug, as it seems, older iPhones are vulnerable. Therefore, you should update your device if your iPhone device is &quot;old&quot;.
Excerpt from the article:
The two WebKit bugs (CVE-2021-30761 and CVE-2021-30762) are memory corruption and use-after-free issues that Apple says were fixed with improved state management.
Instagram‌ ‌Bug Allowed Anyone to View Private Accounts Without Following Them


At first, you might think it&#x27;s impossible to achieve this, but, it&#x27;s software, you can find a way to make it do weird things.
The security researcher was awarded $30k.

                    <span>AWS Secrets Manager helps you protect secrets needed to access your applications, services, and IT resources. The service enables you to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle. Users and applications retrieve secrets with a call to Secrets Manager APIs, eliminating the need to hard code sensitive information in plain text.
Secrets Manager offers secret rotation with built-in integration for Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon DocumentDB. Also, the service is extensible to other types of secrets, including API keys and OAuth tokens. In addition, Secrets Manager enables you to control access to secrets using fine-grained permissions and audit secret rotation centrally for resources in the AWS Cloud, third-party ser…</span>

The data in use remains hidden from the server running the job, allowing confidential workloads to be offloaded to untrusted third parties or cloud providers.

                    <span>When using Redux-connected components, there can be as many as three sources of props:
  props passed from the parent component,
  props returned from mapStateToProps,

  props returned from mapDispatchToProps.
When used with TypeScript, all those props need to have types. If it&#x27;s a stateful class-based component, the state needs to be typed as well. This is a lot of manual type declaration, which has to be also maintained in the future. Luckily, starting from the version 7.1.2 of @types/react-redux package it&#x27;s possible to automatically infer types of connected props in the most cases. The way to do that is documented in the React Redux documentation, and in this post we&#x27;ll see the application on a concrete example.

                    <span>Javascript is great but typescript, is (controversially) even better. It adds type safety to a dynamically typed language and provides some cool features like decorators.
Decorators vary for different programming challenges but the basic point is to wrap something in it and change it&#x27;s behaviour.
Although this feature is currently at stage 2 in javascript, the tc39 committee have been working on it since quite some time and they probably won&#x27;t drop it any time soon.
It’s not yet available in browsers or Node.js, but you can test it out by using compilers like Babel. Having said that, it’s not exactly a brand new thing; several programming languages, such as Python, Java, and C#, adopted this pattern before JavaScript. 
Even though JavaScript already has this feature proposed, Typescript’s …</span>

                    <span>In this tutorial, I’m going to start the process of making a prototype using mock data. My goal at the end of the series is to have quickly mocked data for a prototype while binding it to the UI. As a result, the data can be used across the app and there is only one point of maintenance. 
When I’m done with the series, I will have one data set that I can use to create demo components of my application.
If you are a front-end developer or designer who codes and working without the back-end API for a proof of concept or prototype in the browser, this is for you. In order to complete this tutorial, you’ll need to have a good understanding of HTML. And how to start an Angular application.

Using Azure Pipeline

Local deployment is good in terms of fast development and debugging, but we can’t ship our physical machines to the client in order to access to the application 😂. We have to deploy an application to a web server/cloud in order to make it accessible to the end user on their preferred platform (mobile, desktop, etc).

                    <span>In the past decade, frontend frameworks have dramatically evolved and some of them are game changers. These frameworks not just create cross-platform apps easily but are better for future development too. But when it comes to choosing popular Javascript frameworks in 2021, Vue and angular stand out. With lots of benefits, you might be confused to choose the best framework for business, so here we will discuss both Javascript frameworks on the basis of various parameters. But before digging to the comparison, let’s see an overview of each Vue and Angular.
Vue is an open-source framework that can deal with challenges related to Angular and React. It is popular to build single-page web apps. Vue 3 is the latest version of Vue.js that includes production of standalone reactive objects, templat…</span>

I have to register my Angular Application in one service registry (Eureka) by calling a external POST API before the application loads.

                    <span>In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs.
In these upcoming posts, you&#x27;ll learn the core concepts of Functional Programming including pure functions, how to avoid mutations, and how to write cleaner code with methods like .map() and .filter().
Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: INPUT -&gt; PROCESS -&gt; OUTPUT

Functional programming is about:
Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change


Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output


Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations,…</span>

                    <span>Welcome to the weird notes of a new DevOps and Backend engineer. This is my (quite open) notebook on what was all the stuff I read and learnt. Not necessarily tech, you can just read on and understand what I am rambling on about.
I finally created my own Docker image of a gin-app and deployed it in a kubernetes pod.
The biggest challenge? Connecting the 2 pods, our otlp-example and the opentelemetry-collector. 
I needed to connect from pod A to port 4317 of pod B. Ofcourse, i had exposed the port in pod B using NodePort yet it didn&#x27;t seem to work.
What finally worked? Instead of using 0.0.0.0:4317, I just needed to use otel-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4317 psst, it&#x27;s the port name (or deployment name? not sure) , then namespace, then service and so on, which is exposed by a Node Port in this other service.
MAN ELASTIC APM IS AMAZING. LIKE. SO AMAZING TO LOOK AT THE TRACING &lt;3





  
  
  Stuff I need to check out tomorrow? 📅



Plan on figuring out how to collect logs from a pod using fluentD and exporting it to our dear openetelemetry-collector. 
Use env vars to toggle the GRPC connection port.
Nothing today
Thanks for listening to the rant.

AWS Step Functions is the service provided by Amazon that you can use to create workflows and automate them. These workflows consist of AWS resources, algorithms,
Each component in a step function is called a state machine. In this part, we will be creating multiple state machines, as follows:
State machine for training a model
State machine for saving the model


State machine for configuring endpoints


State machine for model deployment

                    <span>LightDM is a light display manager for Linux, which have lots of different greeters/themes to choose. One of these greeters is the previously known as lightdm webkit2 greeter, then named lightdm web greeter, a greeter that allows theming with web technologies like HTML and JavaScript.
Sadly, this greeter was abandoned as Antergos team didn’t have time to develop their distro. The latest version, 2.2.5 uses an outdated WebKit engine, which could cause some new web technologies to not work in the greeter. Also, the Debian package is not working, a shame.
Luckily, Antergos team were developing a 3.0.0 version, getting rid of WebKit and using the QtWebEngine, based on Chromium, with Python. So, I decided to update some things about this greeter based on this pre-release.
Whither is the “new” tool that 3.0.0 would be using, developed by Antergos, allows to create web applications in a similar way to Electron.js, but in Python.
So, I’m here to introduce a new pre-release. You can install it from the GitHub Repository. Though, you need to install the whither sdk to run it.
Command line arguments support, such as —-help, —-theme, —-debug and others
Some fixes with the LightDM API, as power functions didn’t work
Man pages updated
Every local request is made through web-greeter:/ url scheme
WebKit no longer here. Replaced with Chromium
Some API changes. 2.2.5 deprecated functions and globals were removed
If you are using LightDM, I recommend you to use this greeter, try some themes and create your own!
Use the Glorious theme by Manilarome~ It’s glorious.</span>

Terminal or Command line are quite important to learn and are powerful as well.  
Vim is a text editor, not any text editor but a special and one of the fastest out there, if you use it wisely. Vim can be used in the terminal which means it can run terminal commands inside the editor interface. That makes it quite a great option to improve your terminal command skills and also for enhancing your Linux knowledge. You can run program files from vim itself just by a few keystrokes.

                    <span>I know in Windows, &quot;file extensions&quot;, the part of a file name after the final period in the file name, are more than just part of the file name, they also act as metadata to tell Windows what kind of file the document should be treated as, and what apps to open them in (i.e. what apps are associated with those file types).
However, I want to start moving to Linux (Ubuntu) which I installed on my PC a while back, so, I recently tried making a new file (&quot;extensionless&quot;), and I wanted to make it a different type, so I tested to see if that would work by testing by renaming it .go, so I could try to open it in VSCode like I normally would on WIndows.
I look up multiple searches, involving how to change the file extension (only getting results using command line), and eventually coming over to a horrifying S.O. answer that horrified me, it gave me the info that &quot;extensions&quot; (file types) are determined by header.
There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way in the &quot;Files&quot; file manager for Ubuntu to change the header type.

What I want is a program that can give me a simple GUI to edit the file type of a file so I can easily go between one or the other as needed/wanted.

                    <span>In security parlance, the term &quot;open ports&quot; are used to refer to a TCP or UDP port number that accepts packets. In contrast, closed ports reject connections and ignore all packets directed at them.
Three types of ports are:
Open Port: A port is open, and someone has left the door unlocked.
Closed Port: A closed port is a black hole that&#x27;s open to attack. Administrators should block ports at the firewall level, and this could be exploited if an attacker has compromised another system. This can cause problems for networks because they&#x27;ll have no way of knowing what kind of traffic will come in or out on these vulnerable holes across their firewalls
Filtered Port: Filtered Port: It&#x27;s no small feat to filter all requests. This is likely due to a filtering device, so be careful!

                    <span>📘 Learn how to secure an ASP.NET Web API by granting access only to authorized users through Auth0 authentication and authorization services.


Having control over who can access your API is a necessary requirement to make your application secure. This article will show you how to restrict access to your ASP.NET Web API to authorized users only.
Let&#x27;s start by setting up the ASP.NET Web API application to be protected. You can download a glossary Web API from this GitHub repository by running the following command in a terminal window:
git clone --branch starter --single-branch https://github.com/auth0-blog/glossary-web-api-aspnet.git


This ASP.NET application provides you with a CRUD Web API to manage a glossary of terms. You can learn the details of its implementation by reading this article.
Once you download the application, move to the glossary-web-api-aspnet folder and launch it by typing dotnet run in a terminal window. By pointing your browser to https://localhost:5001/swagger, you should see a page like the following to interactively test the APIs:

The Web API application allows you to get a list of term definitions or a single term definition. It also lets you create a new definition and modify or delete an existing one.
The current implementation of this glossary Web API allows anyone to perform all the available operations on the glossary. Most probably, you want to allow everyone to get a single glossary item or the full glossary. Still, only authorized users should be enabled to create, update, and delete glossary items.
Let&#x27;s go and see how to protect these three actions by integrating your ASP.NET Core Web API with Auth0 services.

We’re excited to announce the first availability of the new Activity page in Auth0’s dashboard. With the refresh, customers have access to actionable insights that give them a high-level understanding of their tenant data without the overhead of third-party tools.
With Activity analytics, developers can ensure that their Auth0 implementation is working and report back usage and utility. Security engineers can quickly gauge failed logins and monitor security events for potential audit. And product owners can easily understand usage and relay that information to relevant stakeholders.
The new Activity page drives more data-driven outcomes by enabling customers to:
Visualize metrics such as active users and failed logins
Compare data across previous time periods
Filter data by specific timeframes
Segment active users across connections and applications (Coming Soon)

                    <span>Network security is the practice of preventing and protecting against unauthorized intrusion into corporate networks. As a philosophy, it complements endpoint security, which focuses on individual devices; network security instead focuses on how those devices interact, and on the connective tissue between them. 
According to the SANS institute Network security is the process of taking physical and software preventative measures to protect the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, malfunction, modification, destruction, or improper disclosure, thereby creating a secure platform for computers, users, and programs to perform their permitted critical functions within a secure environment. 
A brief network security consists of Three layers, Protection, Detection, and Reaction. This is a kind of defense-in-depth strategy. But a system should not rely on a single line of the defense system, rather it should have multiple defense strategies lined up. 
So how can you test your network and security skills, there is a perfect website to validate your skills and prove yourself as a network and security expert. You can visit Free Tech Exams website and attend CompTIA, A+, Network+, and Security+ Practice Test and Exam. They also provide certification on completion of your test. Each segment is consisting of 10 tests you can practice to. Good luck with becoming a network expert.</span>

                    <span>Hi Folks, AWS announced that a new capability in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) called multi-Region keys, where it lets you replicate keys from one Amazon Web Services (AWS) Region into another. 
So today I am going to show how multi-Region keys can be used and its usefulness with few examples.
Multi-Region keys are a set of interoperable KMS keys that have the same key ID and key material, and that you can replicate to different Regions within the same partition. With symmetric multi-Region keys, you can encrypt data in one Region and decrypt it in a different Region.
AWS services also let you configure multi-Region keys for server-side encryption in case you want the same key to protect data in multiple regions. Also multi-region key will be useful for Client-side encryption where …</span>

                    <span>Plug: I help develop million: &lt;1kb virtual DOM - it&#x27;s fast!
The virtual DOM is a tree of virtual nodes that represents what the DOM looks like. virtual nodes are light, stateless, and are JavaScript objects that only contain necessary fields. virtual nodes can be assembled into trees, and &quot;diffed&quot; to make pinpoint changes to the DOM.
The reasoning behind this is because modification and access of DOM nodes is computationally expensive. A diff between virtual nodes, accessing the DOM only for modification, is the premise of virtual DOM. It avoids the DOM as much as possible, favoring plain JavaScript objects instead, making reading and writing much cheaper.
The Million virtual DOM contains three main functions: m, createElement, patch. To completely understand how virtual DOM works, let&#x27;s t…</span>

                    <span>A stack uses LIFO (last-in-first-out) ordering, the most recent item added is the first item to be removed, just like a real stack.

A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list, can be either fixed or dynamic size.
Push - Add an item to the top of the stack
Pop - Remove the top item from the stack
Peek - Return the top of the stack, without removing it.
isEmpty - Return true if the stack is empty.
isFull - Return true if the stack is full, used when the stack is fixed size.
Here&#x27;s an implementation of a stack using an array, in Typescript an array doesn&#x27;t have a fixed length, so the operation isFull is not required, however you can implement a stack with a fixed length and use that operation.
class Stack {
  private array: T[] &#x3D; [];

  pop(): T | undefined {
    if (this.isEmpty()) throw new EmptyStackException();

    return this.array.pop();
  }

  push(data: T): void {
    this.array.push(data);
  }

    if (this.isEmpty()) throw new EmptyStackException();

Everyone is aware that the any type is a bad thing because it would basically be like coming back to Javascript where there&#x27;s no strong type check and anything is allowed.
But even if we respect this rule, we can fall into another pitfal where we break Typescript&#x27;s type-check by casting types. Following chapter will describe you why and how to avoid it.
Type creation can be done in several ways in typescript. It can be anonymous, interface/class declarations, type aliases, duck-typings, etc. (See everything in the doc)
But when it comes about typing a variable, there&#x27;s one syntax only which is with colon :.
const mystring: string &#x3D; &#x27;hello&#x27;; // this example could be duck-typed, but yeah, focus on the colon

The problem is quite simple, but its solution is not obvious. 
Imagine that we are working on a Typescript project and we have defined an interface with several fields using different types. 
interface BlogPost {
  title: string,
  content: string
  publishDate: Date | null,
  isDraft: boolean
}

Let&#x27;s say now that we would like to provide a simple setter that will allow us to update a blog post while running some custom logic. For instance, let&#x27;s consider that our setter will allow updating a post only if it is a draft. 
In Typescript, we would write something like this.
function updatePost(post: BlogPost, property: keyof BlogPost, value): boolean {
    if (!post.isDraft) {
        return false;
    }
    post[property] &#x3D; value;  // error: Type &#x27;any&#x27; is not assignable to type &#x27;n…</span>

After completing the process, you can scan/enter the code in an Authenticator App.

A shell is an interface to the underlying operating system. It allows you to execute operations using text and commands, and it provides users with advanced features like being able to create scripts.
So, everytime you want to execute a command you need to type entire command, I think this is one messy thing we need to do each and every time. To boost productivity and to save time for our lazy squad we have something called Fish. So let&#x27;s see what is it all about.
Fish, or the “Friendly Interactive Shell,” is the most user-friendly and interactive shell, in my opinion.

The University had a shiny DEC VAX 11/780 running VMS. The computer lab was an underground bunker with a bunch of physical terminals. Second year students were allowed a key to access it after hours. Yes a physical key. What did comp-sci students do after hours back in 1984? We played Rogue on a VAX 11/780. 
While Rogue was not the first dungeon-crawling game with procedural generation features, it introduced the subgenre of roguelike RPG procedurally generated dungeon crawlers with Dungeons-and-Dragons-like items (armor, weapons, potions, and magic scrolls) that also had permadeath (permanent death) and an overhead graphical vie…</span>

                    <span>Hi, I was recently doing a project for my portfolio, a React Project with a slightly complex state. Personally, I really love TypeScript and the Redux/Reducer patterns, because they give me a great Developer Experience with TypeScript and a lot of autocompletion available, quite useful in order to not get bit by a bug caused by a typo, and really convenient as I don&#x27;t have to explore files constantly in order to know what are the properties that a certain object should have.
I always prefer to use TS over vanilla JS, so, it makes a lot of sense to try to make use of strict typing, even in a concept app. Also, while vanilla useReducer might not be what most projects use, I still want to share how I found it to be pretty useful in this context.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>
