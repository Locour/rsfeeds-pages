You possibly vehemently disagree with me on this, and that&#x27;s okay.

It&#x27;s literally a post talking about why I, John Woodruff, choose to use Angular in personal projects small and large. Honestly, I&#x27;m not even trying to convince you to use Angular. In fact, my honest advice for picking a framework for a project is to pick the one you know the best, so you can be as productive as possible.

I recently published an article about the compatibility opt-in preview version of Ivy in version 8 and what I experienced attempting to upgrade. This is a follow-on to show what the current upgrade path looks like using Angular v9.0.0-next.6 pre-beta, which contains optimizations for bundle size and performance as well as some bug fixes that were not present in v8’s preview.
As a reminder, Ivy is not ready for production. This is still a compatibility opt-in preview. Use at your own risk. Your mileage may vary.
I’ll be upgrading a large commercial application that leverages many third-party dependencies and a wide gamut of the Angular framework.
The initial step is to upgrade Angular:

                    <span>I started learning React 1 year ago. There was only one thing in my mind How Awesome is React.
Gradually I started thinking about my own website and came over an idea to launch a website, where I can share some technical stuff among people.
I started thinking and thinking🤔 about its architecture (Obviously I am not an architect🤪).
I got some options like ReactJS (Or NextJS), Angular, VueJS or Plain HTML-CSS-JS. Now it was totally on me, which one should I choose, obviously it was going to affect my audience and performance of website too.
I was also aware about the SEO part,🥰 obviously how could I forgot that, because that was the entrypoint of my orgaic readers.
Finally I had these options:
Angular
React (Or NextJS)
VueJS (Or NuxtJS)
Now I compared all of these and found something in Angular and React, which does not fits to my requirements.
Angular Too Hactic🤯
React Server Side Rendering was complex to achieve for a production grade application.😩
NextJS Server Side Rendering was supported, but deployment on personal server was removing some important features.😡
Now the last one
VueJS  I explored VueJS and found that there is a awesome framework on the top of Vue, NuxtJS. I explored it more and more and found these keypoints:
Server Side Rendering Support
Built on Top of VueJS
Lightweight
Can be deployed to own servers, without any performance loss
Open Source
Lot of Options For handling SEO
At this point, I had no doubts &amp; no questions. I had decided that I will go with NuxtJS and create this awesome site.
Now its been 1 month passed, everything is running fine and smoothly with NuxtJS.
Hashcodec.com now. We are planning to launch it on 01st June 2021.
Thanks For Reading This Guys.😇
Don&#x27;t forgot to visit our website Hashcodec.com

                    <span>Scenario:


You encountered a production issue. Immediately you stopped doing whatever you were working on and started fixing the bug. After fixing the bug you observe that you fixed the bug on a different branch. Now you want to move a certain number of commits from a branch A to branch B.
To move a small number of commits from A to B, use the git cherry-pick command
Say, you have the following branches
P ----- Q ----- R ------ S
F ----- G ----- H
(Note: P, Q, R, S, F, G, H are all commit hashes/ids)
and you want to move commits Q &amp; R to B(in front of H). You can do the following by
git checkout branchB
git cherry-pick Q
git cherry-pick R

This will result in
Branch B
F ----- G ----- H ----- Q ----- R
Basically, we first checkout to the branch where we want to add the commits, and cherry-pick the commits we want to move, in the order in which they appear in the first branch. Ensuring that the commits being cherry-picked are in sequential order is important or can result in complications.
Like I said, this method works if the number of commits is small, but to move a large number of commits we can use a better method
git checkout 
  
git rebase HEAD 

So, for the above example - moving Q &amp; R to branch B, the commands would be
git checkout branchB
git rebase --onto H P R
git rebase HEAD branchB

These two tricks should be enough for moving commits between branches.

To do this, we strove to be early birds in the development world. We introduced new methodologies and were the first to try promising tools and offer them to our clients.

                    <span>Real-time processing provides a notable advantage over batch processing --- data becomes available to consumers faster. In the traditional ETL, you would not be able to analyze events from today until tomorrow&#x27;s nightly jobs would finish. These days, many businesses rely on data being available within minutes, seconds, or even milliseconds. With streaming technologies, we no longer need to wait for scheduled batch jobs to see new data events. Live dashboards are updated automatically as new data comes in. 
Despite all the benefits, real-time streaming adds a lot of additional complexity to the overall data processes, tooling, and even data format. Therefore, it&#x27;s crucial to carefully weigh out the pros and cons of switching to real-time data pipelines. In this article, we&#x27;ll look at severa…</span>

                    <span>Session Manager Overview
Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that lets you manage your Amazon EC2 instances through an interactive one-click browser-based shell or through the AWS CLI.


Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.


Session Manager also makes it easy to comply with corporate policies that require controlled access to instances, strict security practices, and fully auditable logs with instance access details, while still providing end users with simple one-click cross-platform access to your Amazon EC2 instances.

Concepts used: Routing tables and Netmask
In this practical, We are going to use three Redhat Enterprise Linux Virtual Machines which are hosting by Oracle VirtualBox.
I already explained these Routing table and Netmask concepts in my previous blog, if you want to know these basic concepts then please refer this
Note: Before starting these VM&#x27;s, make sure that it is connected in Host-only adapter mode and the adapter name should be the same in all three VMs.

First step is to change the IP and set the Netmask by running the following command.

                    <span>If you want to change filenames with given a prefix and do it in all inner folders, its little bit problem and I didn&#x27;t find a solution just pre-defined one command until if you not prepare a command for this reason.
A way to do that, I want to show my way.
After that goes to deep folder, first searching files with regular expressions (Added asterix to code due to passing asterix cause passing all filenames to function) and executing that filename with our ${2} given function.
[[ -n ${2} ]] &amp;&amp; (${2} ${file})

Good, now can prepare change filename function and give it to this script. As you see ${file} will be our first argument ${1}.
function changeFileName() { mv $(pwd)/${1} $(pwd)/_${1}; }
export -f changeFileName

Ok than,
./check.sh .scss changeFileName

Now I added prefix underscore for all my related files in all folders.</span>

Learn how to use Vi mode on the command line in Bash.
Did you know you can use Vim mode on the command line?
After I found out you could enable Vim mode in bash 
set -o vi is always the first line I add to by .bashrc.

Get the SQL Server on Linux for Docker Engine image



I&#x27;m running Docker on MacOS, I will use the SQL Server on Linux for Docker Engine at Docker Hub
   docker pull microsoft/mssql-server-linux

Set the settings and start the container
SQL Server on Linux for Docker Engine requires an environment setting to accept the EULA and set a strong SA password:
   ACCEPT_EULA &#x3D; Y
   SA_PASSWORD &#x3D; 

Run this in the terminal:
   docker run -e &#x27;ACCEPT_EULA&#x3D;Y&#x27; -e &#x27;SA_PASSWORD&#x3D;yourStrong(!)Password&#x27; -p 1433:1433 -d microsoft/mssql-server-linux

Copy a backup to the container




   docker cp &#x27;/tmp/DatabaseName.bak&#x27; mssql-server-linux:/tmp

Restore the backup




   RESTORE DATABASE DatabaseName FROM DISK&#x3D;&#x27;/tmp/DatabaseName.bak&#x27;
   WITH MOVE &#x27;DatabaseName&#x27; TO &#x27;/var/opt/mssql/data/DatabaseName.MDF&#x27;,
   MOVE &#x27;DatabaseName_log&#x27; TO &#x27;/var/opt/mssql/data/DatabaseName_log.ldf&#x27;
   Go

Connect with a docker command or an IDE like DataGrip




Using SQL Server for Linux in Docker has allowed me to continue to develop using a Linux distro or macOS without needing to set up a VM to run the database backend.</span>

                    <span>If you are using Node.js but don’t like its package manager npm, or want a more secure Javascript runtime environment than Node.js, then Deno is for you. It is a program for running Javascript and Typescript code outside of a browser. It is an attempt to reimagine Node.js with the advances in Javascript since 2009, including Typescript compiler. Like Node.js, Deno is basically a shell around the Google V8 JavaScript engine, although dissimilar to Node.js it includes the TypeScript compiler for its executable image. If you are still confused between Deno and Node.js, then this article is for you. Here we’ll discuss the comparison of Deno and Node.js. But before digging to the comparison let’s see the overview of each one.
It executes Typescript and JavaScript to asynchronous desktop servers and apps. Deno is the new implementation which uses modern features of JS language. It is a secure runtime for Typescript and Javascript that uses Google’s V8 and core is built in Rust. Here are some of the advantages of Deno.
Benefits Of Deno-
Supports Typescript
Uses a single executable file
It has a well designed module system
Built-in dependency inspector
It has a code formatter
It takes care of security
Node.js is a server-side javascript environment, based on Google’s JS engine. It is focused on the event-driven HTTP servers. Node.js is an easy-to-built platform which is a scalable and fast network application. It has an event-driven I/O model and non-blocking Node.js which makes it highly efficient. Also, it is a great solution for data-intensive and real-time apps that can run on distributed devices.

                    <span>First, what is this IAM thing about?


Imagine a really big airport, like Hartsfield–Jackson Airport in Atlanta (U.S) or Beijing International Airport (China) with hundreds of airline offices, a lot of flights arriving and leaving, employees doing their different jobs, and many people going around. We can say that everything works in an airport, even if we don&#x27;t know exactly how. It works.

Well, to understand Identity access management (IAM) we can think of Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a big Airport with hundreds of services (airlines), traffic between services (flights), and many users with different roles taking advantage of cloud services (people).



I think that we&#x27;ve all been to the airport at least one time, right? Well, I don&#x27;t know if you noticed but in airports, there is a compl…</span>

This week it&#x27;s mostly about malware and bugs, and one news about data theft. Without no further ado, let&#x27;s begin.
Mystery malware steals 26M passwords from millions of PCs. Are you affected?


I know, it&#x27;s terrifying!.
Excerpt from the article:
The stash also included over 1 million images and more than 650,000 Word and .pdf files. Additionally, the malware made a screenshot after it infected the computer and took a picture using the device’s webcam. Stolen data also came from apps for messaging, email, gaming, and file-sharing. The data was extracted between 2018 and 2020 from more than 3 million PCs.

                    <span>The landscape of malware has shifted dramatically in the past decade or so. Computer viruses that were developed to wreak havoc on companies and individuals by self-replicating, and slowing down or wiping out systems have evolved into big business. Not to diminish the severity of these types of malware, some of them caused billions of dollars in damage. However, the cost of these early viruses usually came in the form of lost revenue due to downtime while the systems were repaired, along with the hit to a company&#x27;s reputation and customer confidence. Many also resulted in stolen data, leading to compromised credentials and identity theft. But more and more, attackers are shifting to a different type of malware for their attacks.

Lastly but by no means least, carrying on from my previous blog about website security week, we&#x27;re going to talk about CSP or Content Security Policy.
CSP is Content Security Policy this is one of the most powerful tools in your arsenal to secure your website.
These are two ways to to set your content security policy, either as a header Content-Security-Policy or via a meta tag in your HTML for example:





The content policy is made up of directives (the thing to restrict) and the value(s) on how it can be restricted. We won&#x27;t cover all all the possible directives in this blog but you can find a list…</span>

                    <span>📕 Learn how to build a realtime chat application with Spring Boot, Auth0 and Ably.


When developing a service, one of the main hurdles to consider is authentication. For every action, you’ll need to both authorize the user (check they are who they say they are) and then ensure they can only do actions which they have permission to do.
Auth0, an authentication and authorization platform, simplifies this process immensely. Not only does it allow for easy integration with your own login systems, it makes integrating other login services such as Google and Twitter simple. It allows for a simple setup of permissions, roles with set permissions attached, and for these roles to be assigned to users. These users can then make use of various login systems to access the same account and thus have the same permissions associated with them.
With Spring Boot, this is extremely powerful, partially due to the strong integration of Auth0 with it. A simple redirect to an Auth0 login page will return a token which a Spring Boot server can use to verify the user and access their associated permissions.
This token can then be used to correctly generate access to other services. For example, Ably, a real-time communications solution, makes use of tokens to authenticate with an Ably App. Once a user has authenticated with Auth0 and has an Auth0 token, they can use this to request a token from a Spring Boot server to authenticate directly with Ably, with the appropriate permissions and access granted.
In this tutorial, we’ll be going through the basics of setting up an interoperating system as described above. The actual service we’ll be providing is a chat application, which will:
Allow users to sign in using a Google account
Signed in users will be able to publish messages to a group chat
Non-signed in users will be able to subscribe and read messages published
Users will be able to see who is online in the chat
Users will, when joining, be able to load the last 20 messages of conversation they’ve missed

I am thinking of creating the REST API in PHP but I can go with Firebase also for Serverless Architecture, if the cost is not going to be exorbitant in the long run and the Firebase Functions are secured automatically against DDoS.
Can anybody give me some pointers? Thanks.</span>

One of the common uses for Golang is to create servers to serve content, be it an API, or serve some files. Develop APIs long enough and soon you&#x27;ll find yourself needing to serve static content such as HTML, JS, CSS.

                    <span>I have lost count of the number of times I&#x27;ve forgotten the password to the local or development CMS.
My natural instinct is to click the Forgot Password link but, obviously, there&#x27;s no way to trigger that email from the local system.
I&#x27;ve spent too long hunting through articles on how to recover the forgotten password. The quickest and easiest solution that I&#x27;ve found is to change the password manually in the database.

WordPress stores passwords in the wp_users table. The prefix may be different if you have elected to change that in the wp-config.php file. It&#x27;s good practice to do that for security.
When you look at the table, it&#x27;ll look a little like this…



ID
user_login
user_pass

WordPress stores your password as an MD5 hashed string. This prevents anyone with access to the database seeing confidential information in plain text.
If this wasn&#x27;t obfuscated like this, we&#x27;d be able to copy our password and paste it into the login form…but we can&#x27;t - and for good reason!
So, to fix our little problem, we need to replace the existing hashed password with a new hashed password - we can&#x27;t overwrite the MD5 hash with plain text because that won&#x27;t work.
I have Hasher installed as a plugin in VS Code. If you don&#x27;t use VS Code or don&#x27;t want to use this extension, MD5 Hash Generator Online works pretty well.
I would recommend that you don&#x27;t create your &quot;forever password&quot; using these hash generators though. Overwrite the existing password with something easy to remember and very, very temporary - a favourite of mine is Pa55word! —

Once the password has been changed, you can log in with your new password and immediately change it to something more secure.
I hope this helps you as much as it has helped me. 😎</span>

                    <span>Working with arrays in a functional way has mostly become the default when working with JavaScript these days. Why should you use a traditional imperative loop, like for, for..of, while, do..while, etc., when you can use map, filter, and forEach?
These functional methods have one caveat, though: You can never throw from them without aborting the whole pipeline.
someArray.map((value) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (someConditionMet) {
    throw new Error(&#x27;...&#x27;); // this is not the best idea...
  }
  // ...
  return someValidValue;
});

So what do you do then? Well, you can return null to mark that you have an invalid result.
someArray.map((value) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (someConditionMet) {
    return null; // now the pipeline can continue
  }
  // ...
  return someValidValue;
});

The beauty of typescript is supposed to be safety. But safety is hard to achieve and at some point typescript may not let you do something that you can tell will work.
This is good. It will make you write a bit more code to explain yourself to typescript.
Let&#x27;s say you want to write a function that can take 2 arguments, and return an array between those two values.
range(3, 5) // returns [3, 4, 5]

So far this is not too dificult with typescript. Let&#x27;s make a little for loop to do it.
function range(start: number, end: number): number[] {
  let newArr: number[] &#x3D; [start]
  for (let i&#x3D;start+1; i&lt;&#x3D; newEnd; i++) {
    newArr.push(i)
  }
  return newArr
}

To break it down this is a function which has takes two arguments, and we are u…</span>

                    <span>TypeScript provides some built-in utility types that help facilitate transformations of types from one form to another.
These utilities are available globally. They can be quite handy in various situations.
Before understanding the TypeScript utility types, it is important to understand type aliases and generics. You can create type aliases for any existing type in TypeScript.
type MyString &#x3D; string;

let helloWorldMessage: MyString &#x3D; &#x27;Hello Wisdom Geek&#x27;;

Type generics are used to create reusable type aliases. Let us say we had an identity function which returns whatever value is passed back in:

const myFunction &#x3D; (argument) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (argument &#x3D;&#x3D; null) {
    throw new Error(&#x27;argument is a required argument&#x27;);
  }
}

Guarding against invalid arguments is perfectly fine. It&#x27;s way better than failing at some random point in your function with a usually pretty obscure error message. But writing guard statements over and over again can bloat code pretty fast.
You could, of course, write a helper function for this, like the one below, which is already better.
const assertPresent &#x3D; (value, name) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (value &#x3D;&#x3D; null) throw new Error(&#x60;${name} is a required argument&#x60;);
};

You can then assert the presence of a parameter on the first lines of your function like this:
const myFunction &#x3D; (argument) &#x3D;&gt; {
  assertPresent(argument, &#x27;argument&#x27;);

                    <span>As awesome as flexbox is, what it’s doing under the hood is actually a little strange because, by default, it is doing two things at once. It first looks at the content size which is what we would get if by declaring width: max-content on an element. But on top of that, flex-shrink is also doing some work allowing the items to be smaller, but only if needed.
Let’s break those two down and see how they work together.

                    <span>In this example I am going to explain you that You can use library to generate breadcrumbs, and also set each page title dynamically.
first you need to install this library to your angular project.
npm install set-title-with-breadcrumbs
This will install library called set-title-with-breadcrumbs, this library is used to generate breadcrumbs component and also you can set page title using angular router. After installing this library..
Go to your app.module.ts file and add below code
import { SetTitleWithBreadcrumbsModule} from &#x27;set-title-with-breadcrumbs&#x27;;
    @NgModule({
        imports : [SetTitleWithBreadcrumbsModule]
    })

in side your app-routing.module.ts file you have to add new data:{} object with breadcrumbs and title object property.
const routes: Routes &#x3D; [
  {
    path: &#x27;home&#x27;,
    component: HomeComponent,
    data: { title: &#x27;Home Page&#x27;, breadcrums: &#x27;Home&#x27; },
    children: [
      {
        path: &#x27;records&#x27;,
        component: RecordsComponent,
        data: { title: &#x27;Find Records Page&#x27;, breadcrums: &#x27;Find-Records&#x27; },
        children: [
          {
            path: &#x27;child&#x27;,
            component: ChildComponent,
            data: { title: &#x27;Child Record Page&#x27;, breadcrums: &#x27;Child-Record&#x27; }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]

as you can see above, each router-path has data object with two property - breadcrumbs and title.
Now inside your app.component.html file you need to add component of library.

In this article, we are going to cover what is Angular Pipe, how to create it and utilize it in our template. Additionally, we will learn how to boost performance with a custom Pipe. 
From  Angular Documentation, 
Use pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, and other data for display. Pipes are simple functions you can use in template expressions to accept an input value and return a transformed value.
Usecase of pipe:
Use DatePipe to convert the Date object to a human-readable format.
UpperCasePipe can be used to convert text to Uppercase.
CurrencyPipe helps to transform a number to a currency string, formatted according to locale rules.
The best advantage to use Pipe is, while transforming the data, it doesn&#x27;t modify the original data. Let&#x27;s see it in acti…</span>

The GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) is a redesigned, enhanced version of GitHub Packages. It not only replaces the Packages Docker service, but also it represents a fundamental shift in how GitHub will provide packages to its customers, because Packages are now tied to organizations and accounts instead of repos.

                    <span>As you could probably tell from the title, we shipped an SDK for Next.js. This means you can capture errors, measure performance, manage releases, configure suspect commits, and automatically upload sourcemaps to view unminified JavaScript and TypeScript with zero(-ish) configuration.
Why was Next.js next on our list? Well, it’s one of the fastest-growing React frameworks and developers love it. Next.js provides a developer experience that helps with building features rapidly, seeing local changes quickly, and reducing build times.
&quot;Next.js turns traditionally complex decisions into simple implementation details. Spinning up new pages with our existing React components and Material UI went from days to hours with Next.&quot;

                    <span>There&#x27;s a principle in programming called Don&#x27;t Repeat Yourself (DRY). The reason repeated code is a problem is because any change requires fixing code in multiple places. This usually means more work for programmers and more room for errors.


Notice in the example below that the eat method is shared by Cat and Bear:




function Cat(name) {
  this.name &#x3D; name;
}

Cat.prototype &#x3D; {
  constructor: Cat,
  eat: function() {
    console.log(&quot;nom nom nom&quot;);
  }
};

function Bear(name) {
  this.name &#x3D; name;
}

Bear.prototype &#x3D; {
  constructor: Bear,
  eat: function() {
    console.log(&quot;nom nom nom&quot;);
  }
};

The eat method is repeated in two places. The code can be edited to follow the DRY principle by creating a supertype (or parent) called Animal:




function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype &#x3D;…</span>

                    <span>One of the more daunting thing of developing, is to get to know how to deploy, as it&#x27;s almost guaranteed that you will incur in some kind of cost, so before doing the big jump to trying a VPS (as a service), I decided to make a local Virtual Server to do some testing in setting up server environments.
Well, to give a little explanation of what I was doing, I need to explain how to web works.
Now and then I have been mentioning about Front-end and Back-end, in some way, you can rename both to Client-Side and Server-Side. The Client is often you, the end-user, whoever visits the web app or webpage, technically the client-side code is executed by the browser and do whatever needs to be done. Typically, it means to fetch, display, and update data.

                    <span>wp-content/uploads was done quickly, but Wordpress Media Library didn’t “see” the files. 
After some quick reading I found out that they need to be imported into the Library, and after some more reading I found wp-cli works with ‘xargs’ in Bash.
Helpful links at Dev Notes and StackOverflow
The command I ended using is as follows through SSH:
find /tmp -name &#x27;*.pdf&#x27; -or -name &#x27;*.doc&#x27; -or -name &#x27;*.jpg&#x27; -or -name &#x27;*.xls&#x27; -or -name &#x27;*.docx&#x27; -or -name &#x27;*.xlsx&#x27; | xarg wp media import

Then you can regenerate all the thumbnails using
wp media regenerate --all

I recommend using screen as the import could stop if the connection gets down, because for me on a Digital Ocean server with 2gb took around 2-3 hours.

At least half of those run Linux—and probably the vast majority.

                    <span>The goal of this post is to get you up to speed on two of the main uses of GPG: cryptographically encrypting and decrypting data.
Note: this post is the second in a 2-part series aimed at developing a functional use of GPG for the day-to-day tasks of anyone who cares about software. Check out Part 1 to learn about signing and verifying signatures.
One important aspect of cryptographic keys is that they are simply numbers. They are often really, really big numbers, but simple integers nonetheless. Another important aspect of cryptographic keys as used in GPG is that they come in pairs: a public key and a private key. Knowledge of these numbers (the keys) allows us to perform many tasks, two of which we&#x27;ll tackle here:

                    <span>Introduction



A huge portion of the Internet’s data travels over HTTP/HTTPS through request-response cycles between clients and servers.
Starting A Server 
Express is a Node module, so in order to use it, we will need to import it into our program file. To create a server, the imported express function must be invoked.




const express &#x3D; require(&#x27;express&#x27;);
const app &#x3D; express();

const PORT &#x3D; 4001;
app.listen(PORT, () &#x3D;&gt; {
  console.log(&#x60;Server is listening on port ${PORT}&#x60;);
});

In this example, our app.listen() call will start a server listening on port 4001, and once the server is started it will log &#x27;Server is listening on port 4001&#x27;
Writing Your First Route
&gt; Once the Express server is listening, it can respond to any and all requests. 
&gt; For example, if your server receives a GET request at ‘/about’, we will use a route to define the appropriate functionality for that HTTP verb (GET) and path (/about).




// Open a call to &#x60;app.get()&#x60; below:
app.get(&#x27;/expressions&#x27;,(req,res, next)&#x3D;&gt;{
   // Here we would send back the moods array in response
})

Inside app.js, create a route handler to handle a GET request to &#x27;/expressions&#x27;. For now, give it a req, res, next callback. For now, log the req object inside the callback. Verify that the route works and logs the request by starting your server and clicking the Refresh Expressions button which will send a GET /expressions request.
Sending A Response




app.get(&#x27;/expressions&#x27;, (req, res, next) &#x3D;&gt; {
  res.send(expressions);
});</span>

                    <span>Cybersecurity and privacy should be priorities for every company when pursuing a digital transformation to maintain security and privacy in the modern digital marketplace.
As DevOps teams develop software solutions and reorganize operations&quot;, the focus is often on speed, automation, and business optimization. Security and regulatory compliance can be overlooked as overhead costs when those initiatives are in fact critical, fundamental necessities.
That kind of oversight -- both in practice and in process -- can be costly.
As far back as 2012, then FBI Director Robert Mueller commented on our vulnerability to cyberattacks, saying that there “are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked, and those that will be.”
While that statement was made nearly a decade ago, it’s meaning …</span>

                    <span>We live in a post-Snowden world. For many, that means assuming none of your digital assets are safe from surveillance.
There are ways, however, to use the internet with insane mathematics in your favor to ensure that no one can see whatever it is that you’re sending to someone else.
Cryptography is an ancient mathematical science that was originally used for military communications, and designed to conceal the contents of a message should it fall into the hands of the enemy. Recent developments in cryptography have added additional uses, including mechanisms for authenticating users on a network, ensuring the integrity of transmitted information and preventing users from repudiating (i.e. rejecting ownership of) their transmitted messages.

                    <span>Sometimes it&#x27;s preferible to keep your local development environment as close to production as possible.
In this post I&#x27;ll cover how to configure self-signed SSL certificates using a project called mkcert which makes
The instructions are slightly different depending on your local environment:
Common
WSL2
Firefox on Windows
The first thing you will need is to install mkcert which can be done via homebrew or homebrew for Linux.
$ brew install mkcert

If you intend to use Firefox, you should also install nss.
$ brew install nss

Next run mkcert and pass in the the domain names and IPs you want the certificate to include:
$ mkcert mywebsite.test localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1

Created a new certificate valid for the following names 📜
 - &quot;mywebsite.test&quot;
 - &quot;localhost&quot;
 - &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;
 - &quot;::1&quot;

                    <span>A linked list is a data structure that holds objects arranged in a linear order, this order is determined by a pointer in each node.
There are some types of linked lists: 
Singly linked list - Each node has only a pointer to the next node. 
Doubly linked list - Each node has pointers to both the previous and next node. 
Circular linked list - The last node points to the first element.

Head - the first node
Tail - the last node
Insertion - It&#x27;s possible to insert a new element anywhere in the list, you just have to take care of the pointers. If you are adding an element to the beginning the new node will pointer to the former head node. If you are appending to the tail, the former tail node will point to the new node.

                    <span>In this example I am going to explain you that You can use library to generate breadcrumbs, and also set each page title dynamically.
first you need to install this library to your angular project.
npm install set-title-with-breadcrumbs
This will install library called set-title-with-breadcrumbs, this library is used to generate breadcrumbs component and also you can set page title using angular router. After installing this library..
Go to your app.module.ts file and add below code
import { SetTitleWithBreadcrumbsModule} from &#x27;set-title-with-breadcrumbs&#x27;;
    @NgModule({
        imports : [SetTitleWithBreadcrumbsModule]
    })

in side your app-routing.module.ts file you have to add new data:{} object with breadcrumbs and title object property.
const routes: Routes &#x3D; [
  {
    path: &#x27;home&#x27;,
    component: HomeComponent,
    data: { title: &#x27;Home Page&#x27;, breadcrums: &#x27;Home&#x27; },
    children: [
      {
        path: &#x27;records&#x27;,
        component: RecordsComponent,
        data: { title: &#x27;Find Records Page&#x27;, breadcrums: &#x27;Find-Records&#x27; },
        children: [
          {
            path: &#x27;child&#x27;,
            component: ChildComponent,
            data: { title: &#x27;Child Record Page&#x27;, breadcrums: &#x27;Child-Record&#x27; }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]

as you can see above, each router-path has data object with two property - breadcrumbs and title.
Now inside your app.component.html file you need to add component of library.

Learning from React series:
Part 1 - why examining React is useful even if you won&#x27;t end up using it
Part 2 - what Facebook wanted to do with React and how to get a grasp on it
Part 3 - what is Reactive Programming all about?
Part 4  - is React functional programming?
Part 5 (this one) - Typescript, for better and for worse
Typescript is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of Javascript that allows a lot of type checking and manipulation, hence the name. React and Vue fully support it while Angular requires it. So what is the reason for the adoption of this new language? What are its advantages and disadvantages?

                    <span>The array is still one if not the major data structure in JavaScript. Especially given the fact that Set and Map were introduced way later, many developers have grown comfortable either going with a plain array or using a library for this purpose.
If we now take into account that the array is the only data structure in JavaScript that comes with functional monad methods (map, filter, forEach, etc.), although there is a proposal going on to add these methods to all iterables, it&#x27;s often more comfortable to go with a plain array for most purposes.
The JavaScript array makes no assumptions about its elements. You can mix and match types, and you can also push duplicates. But what if you only want the unique values of your array?
Gladly, there is a pretty short one-liner that makes it easy for you to filter out duplicates and get an array only containing unique values.
You can combine the spread operator together with the Set constructor to quickly get all unique values of an array:
const array &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4];

const unique Values &#x3D; [...new Set(array)];

There is only one issue with this code: The Set relies on the strict equality comparison (&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;), so it doesn&#x27;t work well for objects.

Props can be of any data type, although component data types may differ. Component A, for example, may anticipate a name argument with a text data type, but component B may anticipate an age argument with a numeric data type. Likewise, D may anticipate an onClick argument with a Function data type, but C may expect a post parameter with an object data type with characteristics like title and date.
How can we tell our component what kind of data it should expect?
This may be done in various methods, but this post will focus on PropTypes and TypeScript. Despite holding identical goals, these two techniques operate in different ways. So we’ll go through what these tools are, how to use them, and tell them apart before trying more advanced techniques.
Prior knowledge of PropTypes and TypeScript is necessary for a thorough understanding of this article. You’ll also require an integrated development environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code.
PropTypes is a type-checking tool for props in React apps that can be used at runtime. The PropTypes efficiency has been provided through the prop-types package since React 15.5. PropTypes let you specify the props that are expected in a component, such as whether they are mandatory or optional. You’ll get a warning in the browser’s JavaScript console if you provide a different type to an element or miss a required prop:

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>
