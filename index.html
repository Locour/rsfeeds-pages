I&#x27;m new to Angular. I came across the code with three variants. I want to know what difference does these three makes implementing in the Reactive forms(Form group, Form builder, and Form control).
Is there any priority based on the application performance of one over the other way of doing…

                    <span>Python.


Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
It is very simple to use and implement. 
It is open source and has a very big community of developers.
Object-oriented and functional programming. 
A lot of applications.
The installation procedure involves downloading the official Python .exe installer and running it on your system.
Python website.
.
Run the Python Installer once downloaded. 
.
For all recent versions of Python, the recommended installation options include Pip and IDLE. Older versions might not include such additional features.
Pip is a powerful package management system for Python software packages. Thus, make sure that you have it installed.
To verify whether Pip was installed:
Open the Start menu and type &quot;cmd.&quot;
pip -v

In this section, we are going to look to take a surface dive into Kubernetes by inspecting its architecture. Whether you are a fan of minimal version of k8s like k3s or robust cloud-specific versions like EKS, AKS, or GKE - the information explained here applies to all of them.
So lets start to breakdown this architecture:

Kubernetes at its essence is a collection of servers that work together to achieve a single purpose; run your workloads. These servers are referenced as &quot;Nodes&quot;, and their responsibility is to run your workloads by placing containers into Pods.
Since Nodes are servers, they can be anything from physical machines to even virt…</span>

To execute the new latest updates, new developer team members need to be added. And this will eventually add more and more complications to the project.
To clear up the mess, you would need to convert this gigantic app into small pieces of information to handle it better way.
Node.js Microservices facilitates these tasks. But for beginners in the development industry, let’s understand what nOde.js Microservices are and how that works.

Codespaces, a cloud-powered development environment that allows you to build, run and debug your code in the cloud.
Actions, an automation platform that allows you to automate your development workflow.
I&#x27;m going to focus on GitHub Actions in this post. This will be a basic introduction to the concept of GitHub Actions for developers of all skill levels.

                    <span>Before talking about Docker, let’s first talk about Virtualization in general.
Virtualization is a way to utilize the underlying hardware more efficiently.
In general, yes. If every single application requires a separate machine, chances are that most of the time that machine will be underutilized and we will be wasting the hardware resources like CPU, memory, etc.
With virtualization, many applications can share the same physical hardware.
A virtualization solution acts as a layer on top of actual hardware.

It does so via a Hypervisor.
Hypervisor is a software through which we achieve desired virtualization.
There are two types of hypervisors:
Type-1 aka bare-metal because it runs directly on the hardware.
Type-2 runs as an application on the host operating system.

Back in the days, when creating an AWS account was a lot of overhead, common pattern was to have multiple teams sharing a single account. This created a demand to isolate teams from each other by assigning them an IAM policy that would grant access only to their part of the account. While it might have been possible (in theory) to create complex IAM policies to containerize resources by application or team, one fundamental problem did remain. Once you granted a right to create an IAM policy or role, you effectively granted admin level access to everything on the account. IAM has very granular …</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Everything in JavaScript is treated as an object. Functions too are  high class objects in a way and are treated as such in javaScript.  
To make large complex objects simple, many small objects are composed together. Composition is a cleaner, reusable and better solution for better code.

const MoneyInbank &#x3D; {
    highRate(investspeed, devestSpeed) {
      return investspeed + devestSpeed;
    },
    lowrate(investspeed, devestSpeed) {
      return investspeed- investspeed;
    },
  };

const StopDebt &#x3D; {
    stop(investspeed) {
      this.investspeed &#x3D; 0;

      return 0;
    },
  };

const Bank &#x3D; {
    model: &quot;Grco&quot;,
  };

To make this large object smaller and reusable and implement functionality we can create a function that implements a functionality.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve moved (are planning to move) to new domain &amp; you don&#x27;t want to simply redirect to new domain.
This simple PHP script shows very simple message that domain has changed for set amount of seconds, then redirected to the new domain.
It is also render 301 status code. So Google will know your page was moved, too.
It will fetch the current request URL, and redirect to the new domain with exact same URI.
By the way, it has Japanese text, too :)

This post was copied from Readme. If there is a newer version and newer description at GitHub readme, refer to GitHub&#x27;s readme.
For Apache server, mod_rewrite module should be enabled, and allowing to use .htaccess


You could set it in Apache config.
For Nginx server


PHP-FPM
Ability to set nginx config
Change the config values such as new domain to index.php to your desired state.
Place (or upload) index.php script to your old domain&#x27;s webroot and clear all other files
Edit your apache config, .htaccess or Nginx config so that all request will go through this index.php
Enjoy the rest
$newDomain: Enter the new domain name. Starts with https://
$siteNameEn: Site name in English.
$siteNameJa: Site name in Japanese.
$sec: Seconds to wait and redirect
Create .htaccess file (if your server is allowing it), and enter the following.
RewriteBase.

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase / # if it&#x27;s lives under subdirectory, add the directory accordingly
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}/index.html !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}/index.php !-f
RewriteRule . index.php [L]



I assume you know about Nginx server and its config.
~ \.php($|/) location to send it to php-fpm.
absolute_redirect must be turned off.
location / {

Continuous-Integration (ci): is a software engineering and coding approach that allows developers and teams to make small releases code changes and merged them into a version control repository. because most modern applications use different tools, technologies, and platforms. teams need automation methodology to integrate and smoothly validate their changes.
Continuous-Delivery (cd): raise where ci ends, the main goal of cd is to automate the application deployment and production, teams practicing cd can changes code, add new features, bug fixes, and configure changes automatically. cd has solved the problem of miscommunication between the Dev team and ops team 
benefits of ci/cd:

                    <span>In this blog we will be exploring the following fields in Linux:
User Account Management
Group Management
File Permissions And Ownership
Question arises why to have different user accounts? To answer this following are some points that we keep in mind.
Each user will have their own individualized private space.
Will help in distinguishing privileges among users.
Note : root user is a special user who is able to do anything on the system.
UID : It is a unique number that is assigned to the user account. It is also used for determination of user privileges and activity tracking.
GID : Indicates default group of the user.
Comment : Using comment field for contact information.
Home Directory : This is owned by a user and will be found on system under /home directory, except for root.

                    <span>What is AWK?


AWK is a command-line programming language primarily oriented to text and files processing - some might call it a tool -, simple yet elegant continuous lines of code can replace multiple lines of a more robust language like java or node without losing their intention.
In essence, AWK code is so simple that you can just throw it away after the execution or once your program has finished its work.
% awk &#x27;BEGIN { print &quot;Hello World&quot; }&#x27;
Hello World

But there is so much more than that; considering the constant need to process data files, once you have started with AWK, you will stop building complete programs to process CSV or log files for faster and more straightforward with a couple of instructions
% awk &#x27;{ print $0 }&#x27; example.txt
This is an AWK example

                    <span>Hey Dev community! 😆
After weeks of exams and dealing with imposter syndrome, I am back with another short article on &#x27;file commands&#x27; in Linux. These are pretty useful so take a look. 🤠
The &#x27;cd&#x27; command moves you into any directory you want. For example, if I have files located in the &#x27;Documents&#x27; directory, this is the command I would run:
cd Documents
and this would move me to that directory.

The &#x27;ls&#x27; command lists everything that is in that directory. To list everything in the directory, run this command:
ls -l

the &#x27;cat&#x27; commands displays what is inside a file. Simply run this command:
cat (name of file)

The cat command also can do other things. 👇
Using this command, you can also create a file.
What I did below was I created the file, typed out what I needed to, then viewed the fil…</span>

To execute the new latest updates, new developer team members need to be added. And this will eventually add more and more complications to the project.
To clear up the mess, you would need to convert this gigantic app into small pieces of information to handle it better way.
Node.js Microservices facilitates these tasks. But for beginners in the development industry, let’s understand what nOde.js Microservices are and how that works.

Also some HTML and CSS for templates and styling purposes. At the end of this tutorial you will have a great foundation to start creating your own applications.
To start we first need to download Nodejs from its website. Then we proceed  to install NodeJs. Once the software is installed, &quot;The Node Package Manager&quot; npm will also be installed.

Basically, we should be able to: 
retrieve all menus
retrieve one menu
create a menu
update a menu
delete a menu
Great, let&#x27;s dive in.
To create a new Nodejs project, we&#x27;ll first run this command on the terminal.
yarn init

It&#x27;ll ask a couple of questions before initializing the project. Anyway, you can bypass this by adding a -y flag to the command.
Next step is to create a structure for our project.

Date has been a long-standing pain point in ECMAScript. Temporal, is  a global Object that acts as a top-level namespace (like Math), that brings a modern date/time API to the ECMAScript language. 
Date, and the motivations for Temporal, see: Fixing JavaScript Date.
Temporal fixes these problems by:
  Providing easy-to-use APIs for date and time computations
  First-class support for all time zones, including DST-safe arithmetic
  Dealing only with objects representing fixed dates and times
  Parsing a strictly specified string format
  Supporting non-Gregorian calendars
Object Relationship

Code examples
Temporal.Now
Temporal.Now.instant() - get the exact time since Unix epoch
Temporal.Now.timeZone() - get the current system time zone
Temporal.Instant
const instant &#x3D; Temporal.Instant.from(&#x27;1969-07-20T20:17Z&#x27;);
instant.toString();  // &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;1969-07-20T20:17:00Z&#x27;

                    <span>In software engineering, dependency injection is a technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on, called dependencies.
Typically, the receiving object is called a client and the passed-in (&#x27;injected&#x27;) object is called a service. 
The code that passes the service to the client is called the injector. Instead of the client specifying which service it will use, the injector tells the client what service to use. The &#x27;injection&#x27; refers to the passing of a dependency (a service) into the client that uses it.
We can inject the classes into another class’s constructor and then get the object of that class, and through that object, we can access its methods and properties.

                    <span>There are a bunch of best practices out there that recommend to split your Express.js routes into separate files using Express.Router().
But creating new routes this way isn&#x27;t straightforward and requires quite a few lines of boilerplate code for each newly introduced endpoint.
// this is messy
import express from &quot;express&quot;

const router &#x3D; express.Router()

router.route(&quot;/&quot;)
  .get(async (req, res) &#x3D;&gt; {
    ...
  })

export default router

Fortunately, the framework era taught us better and popularized cleaner alternatives like file based routing.
Consider the following project structure:
├── app.ts // main file
├── routes
    ├── index.ts // index routes
    ├── posts
        ├── index.ts
        └── [id].ts // dynamic params
    └── users.ts
└── package.json

This approach can work for you out-of-the-box too!
npm install express-file-routing

express-file-routing will transform all of your files inside /routes into valid paths.
/routes/index.ts → /
/routes/posts/index.ts → /posts
/routes/posts/[id].ts → /posts/:id
/routes/users.ts → /users




// app.ts
import express from &quot;express&quot;
import { router } from &quot;express-file-routing&quot;

const app &#x3D; express()

app.use(router())

// /routes/users.ts
export const get &#x3D; async (req, res) &#x3D;&gt; {
  res.json([])
}

By default, exported functions like get, post, put, patch, del etc. will get matched their corresponding HTTP method automatically.
Adding middlewares is equally intuitive:
// /routes/posts.ts
import { rateLimit, userAuth } from &quot;../middlewares&quot;

export const post &#x3D; [
  rateLimit(), userAuth(),
  async (req, res) &#x3D;&gt; {
    res.status(201).json({})
  }
]

En esta primera entrega vamos a ver un tema básico: Variables y Constantes.
JavaScript fue creado en un mundo completamente distinto al que vivimos actualmente (tecnológicamente hablando), tenía otros propósitos y no fue inicialmente diseñado para soportar todo lo que actualmente le delegamos. Es por eso que JavaScript ha ido evolucionando con el tiempo y naturalmente en esa &quot;evolución&quot; han ido quedando vestigios de su antiguo yo, un ejemplo de esto es el uso de la palabra reservada var.

                    <span>This is first repost in series that covers various details of migrating services from traditional data center to AWS. You can find this and other post from my personal blog https://carriagereturn.nl/
Back in the days, when creating an AWS account was a lot of overhead, common pattern was to have multiple teams sharing a single account. This created a demand to isolate teams from each other by assigning them an IAM policy that would grant access only to their part of the account. While it might have been possible (in theory) to create complex IAM policies to containerize resources by application or team, one fundamental problem did remain. Once you granted a right to create an IAM policy or role, you effectively granted admin level access to everything on the account. IAM has very granular …</span>

                    <span>Today, I released a new version of my website with only one new feature: syndication through RSS, Atom and JSON Feed. Even though by some accounts, RSS seems to be dead, I strongly believe RSS is an important feature in the fight to keep ownership over your own content while also increasing exposure. The way I approach publishing and sharing my content, is called POSSE:
Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere.
RSS is an important part of that strategy.
Luckily, I&#x27;m not the only one who values RSS. There are others
In this article I want to share how I implemented syndication feeds in my NextJS-powered website.
I did some Googling to see how other NextJS users were generating RSS feeds, and there turned out to be many people that had solved this particular problem and wrote about it…</span>

TypeScript - const assertion can prevent literal types from being treated as more general types, e.g. const config &#x3D; {light: &quot;ON&quot;} as const; will have light as the literal type &quot;ON&quot; instead of string, making it compatible with type {light: &quot;ON&quot; | &quot;OFF&quot;}. It&#x27;ll also make light readonly. More explanation can be found on the official documentation page. 


JWT - it can be signed asymmetrically with a key pair or symmetrically with a shared secret. The latter means all parties involved use one secret for both signing and signature verification, which means any party with the shared secret could have signed the JWS - something to be taken into consideration during implementation.


Design &amp; storytelling - good stories are engaging and help build empathy, adapting them to your audience and backing up the points with data could be helpful in getting buy-in during a design process. NN/g has an article on 6  rules for persuasive storytelling.




  
  
  Note of the week


On the week 41 of 2021, I found out about a portable game console powered by a microcontroller - PicoSystem, an interesting product considering it is sporting the RP2040 just like a Raspberry Pi Pico. That&#x27;s all for this week&#x27;s post, thank you for reading and if you have got any feedback, do let me know by leaving a comment. Have a nice day!</span>

                    <span>In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll be using TypeScript and Docker to build a Menu Restaurant API app from scratch with Node, Express, and MongoDB. The Docker part is optional.
Basically, we should be able to: 
retrieve all menus
retrieve one menu
create a menu
update a menu
delete a menu
Great, let&#x27;s dive in.
To create a new Nodejs project, we&#x27;ll first run this command on the terminal.
yarn init

It&#x27;ll ask a couple of questions before initializing the project. Anyway, you can bypass this by adding a -y flag to the command.
Next step is to create a structure for our project.

                    <span>Running arbitrary code on a schedule is a very common use case. A common way of doing that is by using cron jobs. But how would you do that in the cloud (specifically AWS) without having to run a Linux instance or something similar?
One way of doing that is by leveraging Amazon EventBridge and Lambda. We will be creating a reusable AWS CDK construct that deploys a Lambda which will be executed on a configurable schedule. We will use that construct to deploy an example Lambda which fetches a quote from a 3rd-party API and logs it to the console. This is how it looks like:

You can find the finished example on GitHub.
💡 I&#x27;ll add some tips that are optional and just reflect the way I like doing stuff. They are formatted like this paragraph.

                    <span>In software engineering, dependency injection is a technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on, called dependencies.
Typically, the receiving object is called a client and the passed-in (&#x27;injected&#x27;) object is called a service. 
The code that passes the service to the client is called the injector. Instead of the client specifying which service it will use, the injector tells the client what service to use. The &#x27;injection&#x27; refers to the passing of a dependency (a service) into the client that uses it.
We can inject the classes into another class’s constructor and then get the object of that class, and through that object, we can access its methods and properties.

Infinite Scroll is the ability to scroll through a large infinite list without compromising the performance of application. It improves user experience of the application. In this article I will cover how to implement infinite scroll with API in Angular 12 with the help of RxJS Operators.
A question comes in mind that how it works internally. It works like there is a big list say 10k items are there. Displaying all those items in once is not possible as it will break the application. And you can not put numbering pagination as that will look bad on the place or you have dropdown (dropdowns can not number paginations).
In that case you need infinite scroll. It loads only 10 (size is provided in configuration) r…</span>

Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
ng-recaptcha is a simple and configurable reCAPTCHA v2 and v3 component library.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the account. Access the site https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ and click on the button v3 Admin Console.

2. Fill in the field Email or phone and click on the button Next to login with your Google account and if you don&#x27;t have an account, just create a new account.

3. Click on the button +.

This article is a part of a series about how to create Generic CRUD Service &amp; Models in Angular:
Part 1 - Understanding Generics
Part 2 - What is CRUD?
Part 3 - Generic CRUD Model

  Generic CRUD Service


Before we start generating and writing code, let’s take a step back and see the bigger picture. The generic service should accept the following arguments:
the HttpClient is used for the HTTP requests
the class of model for creating instances
the path of the API endpoints.
Also, all resources should have 5 main methods related to CRUD…
Create - Returns a new resource.
Get all - Retrieves all resources as a list.
Get by ID - Returns a specific resource by ID.
Update - Updates a specific resource by…</span>

The same happen with our users work with our angular apps, we show the component, but the data is not there or the HTTP request take time, and they are waiting.
A good solution is show a loading until get the data, but if my users want the beers ready from the beginning ? No problem because Angular have a solution, The Resolvers.
The Resolvers help us to prefetch data, before the router finish start the transition between components, and store.
The resolvers are helpful to avoid show an empty component, and  have our data ready, before move to the component.

So, I recently had to solve a problem with one of my NodeJS servers. I had to parse and process data from an excel sheet which turned out to be pretty CPU-intensive and it blocked the NodeJS event loop, effectively freezing my server till it&#x27;s done. I wasn&#x27;t surprised though; I expected this to happen. While there are several things you could do to resolve this, I&#x27;m going to present a solution using the NodeJS worker_threads module. Before we start, let&#x27;s quickly talk about this thread thing. The code used in this article is available here.

                    <span>In this article, you’ll learn how to use the Node.js crypto module to perform cryptographic operations on data. I&#x27;ll show you how to encrypt data with a secret key and then decrypt it using the same secret key when required.

Create a new project
Create a new directory in your local file system and switch to it by typing the following
mkdir encr_decr &amp;&amp; cd encr_decr
npm init -y

Now install the crypto module
npm install crypto --save

Now make app.js.
Add following code to app.js
var Crypto &#x3D; require(&#x27;crypto&#x27;);
var secret_key &#x3D; &#x27;fd85b494-aaaa&#x27;;
var secret_iv &#x3D; &#x27;smslt&#x27;;
var encryptionMethod &#x3D; &#x27;AES-256-CBC&#x27;;
var key &#x3D; Crypto.createHash(&#x27;sha512&#x27;).update(secret_key, &#x27;utf-8&#x27;).digest(&#x27;hex&#x27;).substr(0, 32);
var iv &#x3D; Crypto.createHash(&#x27;sha512&#x27;).update(secret_iv, &#x27;utf-8&#x27;).digest(&#x27;hex&#x27;).substr(0, 16);
var encryptedMessage &#x3D; encrypt_string(&quot;hello&quot;, encryptionMethod, key, iv);
console.log(encryptedMessage); 
// output : L2dOZjlDVmxoSDNWdmpVMkNGd0JEdz09
var decrptMessage &#x3D; decrypt_string(encryptedMessage, encryptionMethod, key , iv);
console.log(decrptMessage);  
//output : hello

function encrypt_string(plain_text, encryptionMethod, secret, iv) {
  var encryptor &#x3D; Crypto.createCipheriv(encryptionMethod, secret, iv);
  var aes_encrypted &#x3D; encryptor.update(plain_text, &#x27;utf8&#x27;, &#x27;base64&#x27;) + encryptor.final(&#x27;base64&#x27;);

Trivy is a simple and comprehensive scanner for vulnerabilities in container images, file systems, and Git repositories, as well as for configuration issues in IaC. Trivy detects vulnerabilities of OS packages (Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, etc.) and language-specific packages (Bundler, Composer, npm, yarn, etc.). In addition, Trivy scans Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files such as Terraform, Dockerfile and Kubernetes, to detect potential configuration issues that expose your deployments to the risk of attack.
You can scan your Terraform configuration artifacts easily giving you the confidence that all is well with your configuration before deploying your Terraform (IaC) configurations. It is a free/open source tool by AquaSecurity. For more information go check out th…</span>

                    <span>There is no doubt that YAML has developed a reputation for being a painful way to define and deploy applications on Kubernetes. The combination of semantics and empty spaces can drive some developers crazy. 
As Kubernetes advances, is it time for us to explore different options that can support both DevOps and Developers in deploying and managing applications on Kubernetes?
Pulumi: Modern infrastructure as code for developers, a.k.a the new kid on the block.
Pulumi targets the widespread infrastructure as code (IaC) space but using a different approach. It allows developers to define infrastructure using their language of choice, such as TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and others, instead of a proprietary language, such as HCL, from our friends at HashiCorp.

                    <span>Recently I tried to migrate my project&#x27;s codebase from CRA (create-react-app) to ViteJS. It was not as simple as it seemed actually. Because I wanted to remove react-scripts completely and use just Vite instead.
These are the basic features that I wanted the project setup with Vite to have (that was present in CRA):
Typescript Support
Jest Test Runner with React Testing Library
Import SVG as components (actually decided against it later)
Using Absolute imports
ESLint &amp; Prettier Support
Additionally I went on to add following features also:
TailwindCSS (with JIT mode)
Husky + Lint-Staged (to run eslint &amp; prettier on pre-commit)
CommitLint (to enforce conventional-commits)
Additional ESLint Plugins
Source Map Explorer
React-Error-Boundary

                    <span>Are &quot;else&quot; statements really necessary? When first learning to program we are taught about &quot;if&quot; statements and &quot;else&quot; statements. If this condition is met do something, else do another thing. It&#x27;s fundamental to nearly every programming language, but can we ditch the &quot;else&quot; statement?
Like with most things in programming there will be scenarios where using an &quot;else&quot; statement is more appropriate than avoiding it, but let&#x27;s assume that we want to ditch it no matter what scenario arises. How would we do that and why would we want to?
The best way to explore this approach is through examples so let&#x27;s start with a simple one. All of the examples below are written in Typescript:
// With &quot;else&quot;
const areEqual &#x3D; (value1: string, value2: string) &#x3D;&gt; {

Coleções são, em resumo, uma representação de um grupo de objetos. Uma coleção iterável é um tipo de coleção onde pode-se iterar nos elementos. Em outras palavras, são coleções onde podemos navegar nos seus elementos.
Ambas as linguagens (Dart e TypeScript) tem implementações nativas para criação de coleções iteráveis. Em ambas, esse tipo é chamado de Iterable. Cada uma, obviamente, possui uma implementação diferente, mas ambas têm o mesmo objetivo e funções similares.
Os tipos mais comuns de coleções iteráveis são: Lists (ou Arrays), Maps e Sets. Nesse artigo, v…</span>

                    <span>Sometimes we have a long  list of imports, with files that come from the same place, it makes our code noisy and a bit longer, something like:
import { BeersService } from &#x27;./services/beers.service&#x27;;
import { WhiskyService } from &#x27;./services/whiski.service&#x27;;
import { WineService } from &#x27;./services/wine.service&#x27;;

We can simplify it by exposing all files, from a single file, to point to all of them.
Create drinks.ts into the service directory and export all services.
export * from &#x27;./beers.service&#x27;;
export * from &#x27;./whiski.service&#x27;;
export * from &#x27;./wine.service&#x27;;

Now we can update our files, to the new path.
import { BeersService, WhiskyService, WineService } from &#x27;./services/drinks&#x27;;

Thanks @lissetteibnz
 , If rename the filename from drinks.ts to index.ts, Javascript understand the file index like the entrypoint for the directory, so  it works only using the directory name.
import { BeersService, WhiskyService, WineService } from &#x27;./services&#x27;;

The code looks clean and easy to ready because all of them comes from the same place.

  Generic CRUD Service


Before we start generating and writing code, let’s take a step back and see the bigger picture. The generic service should accept the following arguments:
the HttpClient is used for the HTTP requests
the class of model for creating instances
the path of the API endpoints.
Also, all resources should have 5 main methods related to CRUD…
Create - Returns a new resource.
Get all - Retrieves all resources as a list.
Get by ID - Returns a specific resource by ID.
Update - Updates a specific resource by…</span>

Measure twice and cut once.

We wanted the absolute best developer experience for the users. So, we settled after a few trials on a process that worked well for us.
I set up working sessions between the component dev and myself.
Every component started with its own markdown file to document the design.
We put down the ideal developer usage and experience, for the component.
We referenced our existing version, component tickets history and industry leaders.
The states and interactions were then considered.
Once satisfied, we sought feedback from the rest of the dev team.
We also sought the feedback of some key dev community members.
The final design would then be honed, ready for coded implementation.

It looks like your application can&#x27;t read the environment variable properly.
I don&#x27;t know which package you are using to load environment variables but the simplest way is using dotenv package.
After installing it with npm i dotenv, import it as early as possible in your application main file like…

                    <span>In recent times, if you were a C# developer who wanted to build code for browsers, you had to resort to JavaScript, the most widely used programming language in the world. However, the web development industry is rapidly evolving, and developers no longer need to rely on JavaScript to create high-end online apps. Blazor is making it possible to run.NET in the browser without the need for add-ons or plugins, due to a technique called WebAssembly.
This blog will examine the current status of Blazor, its features, and its preparedness for production use, before comparing it to one of the most popular frameworks, Angular.
Here is why you should choose Angular for your next web development project.

One of the very first challenges I faced was making sure I can connect to the internet using my D-Link DWM-157 modem.
After doing some google search I came to know about ‘Modem Manager GUI’ and I was so happy. Opened my terminal and simply typed:
sudo apt-get update


Someone was smiling behind the scene and was whispering not so easy boy! Prepare for the next hurdle.
I was so happy it is a very nice GUI, everything is here for me i just a single click away to check anything. Everything was working perfectly in the GUI except the USSD code !

This is a straight to the point guide on how to make Docker CE run fully on WSL2.
PS: the title says right way, but it is just my personal opinion. I am not claiming that any other guide does it in a wrong way.
A full-fledged Docker installation on WSL2
Docker Daemon automatic start without any crazy hacks
Docker Daemon sharing between Windows and WSL (i.e. you cannot run docker from Windows PowerShell)
Docker Daemon sharing between WSL distributions
I will consider that you already have WSL2 working, and you are using Ubuntu as your distribution.
Install Docker CE on Ubuntu by following the official guide:

All modern motherboards come equipped with an integrated RAID controller, and top models may have several such controllers on board. That’s a different question, though, if such integrated controllers in consumer-class motherboards are ever used by an average user. Anyway, some motherboards do give a chance to setup a RAID array right inside your home PC.
Below are brief recommendations on building a RAID array on a home computer and a practical tutorial on assembling a PC for RAID.

Microsoft thwarts record‑breaking DDoS attack


DDoS is short for Distributed Denial of Service attacks and its main objective is to overwhelm a target infrastructure with more than it can handle on a typical day.
In this article, Amer Owaida of welivesecurity details how Microsoft thwarted a DDoS attack against an Azure customer.

                    <span>A password manager is a computer program that allows users to store, generate, and manage their passwords for local applications and online services. A password manager assists in generating and retrieving complex passwords, storing such passwords in an encrypted database, or calculating them on demand. For the past seven years &quot;123456&quot; and &quot;password&quot; have been the two most commonly used passwords on the web. The problem is, most of us don&#x27;t know what makes a good password and aren&#x27;t able to remember hundreds of them anyway.
Most web browsers offer at least a rudimentary password manager. (This is where your passwords are stored when Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox ask if you&#x27;d like to save a password.) This is better than reusing the same password everywhere, but browser-based password m…</span>

In addition, the final rule of the 21st Century Cures Act, effective June 30, 2020, implements provisions to “advance interoperability and support the access, exchange, and use of electronic health information”.

Assume a demo namespace has two IRSA roles create with trust policy system:serviceaccount:demo:*
IAM Role 1 - ServiceAccount01 - access to S3 
Pod1 with ServiceAccount01 can access Role 2 just by exporting the AWS_ROLE_ARN &#x3D;  so that it will get access to S3 and DynamoDB .
EKS supports IRSA roles for the aws-node daemonset, it is security best practice to use IRSA role instead of system node role. 
Update the pod spec with automountServiceAccountToken&#x3D;false attribute if there is no need for the application to access EKS Control plane API.</span>

what would be a good way to categorize secrets?
Take a look at this:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID &#x3D; A3T6AKIAFJKR45SAWS5Z
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY &#x3D; hjshnk5ex5u34565d4654HJKGjhz545d89sjkjak

You can spot the difference: the first one is tied to a well identified service, AWS, while for the second, things are a bit blurrier: we immediately understand that it has to do with a database connection, but, without further context it doesn&#x27;t tell us what doors it opens.

When a Scaleway Elements API Key is saved in Gitlab, we face all the security issues of storing credentials outside of the cloud infrastructure: Key rotation, age, destruction, location, etc.
There are 2 common reasons for developers to store GCP credentials in Gitlab CI:
They use shared runners.
They use specific/group runners deployed in a Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule cluster but do not use (or do not know about) Gitlab additional configurations.
The alternative that Gitlab CI proposes for users is to mount a secret volume to the runner pods that are created for each build.

                    <span>With the ever increasing adoption of moving workloads to public cloud providers like AWS, satisfying regulatory compliance has emerged as one of the most demanding requirements for businesses that operate on the cloud.
As an AWS customer, this means that you need to establish a proper governance model for your business operations to continue, particularly for those that operate under specific regulations. This &quot;model&quot;, is conceptualised under AWS Control Tower as a collection of guardrails. A guardrail is simply a rule that describes what is allowed or disallowed in your AWS account. Now, a guardrail can be of two forms, a preventive guardrail or a detective guardrail.

awk is a powerfull command line tool found included in all modern GNU/linux distributions. It is often excluded from beginner level Linux tutorials, where more fundamental commands like cd , pwd, ls etc are given more priority, and rightfully so. One must have a good grasp on the basic commmand line tools in order  to harness the full power of awk. 
awk in essence is a pattern scanning and processing language, emphasis on the language part because awk possesses functionality akin to most mainstream programming languages. 
awk loves tabulated data. So to begin with, you&#x27;ll need a piece of text represented as columns delimited by some common character. You see this pattern often in shells, for instance, the ls -l command that prints file information delimited by a space :
