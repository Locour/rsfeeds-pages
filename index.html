I have some projects that need to use i18next to handle internationalization, but use typescript to have type definitions, so I used to maintain and use it in the project joplin-utils Yesterday I did a lot of refactoring, and now it has been pulled out and released as a public npm package. If anyone is interested, you can try it.
English, ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá
i18next&#x27;s typescript type definition generator can generate type definitions from multiple language translation json files, supporting nested objects and parameters.
The type definition generation of the international configuration of cli itself is also done by cli (bootstrapping)
yarn add -D @liuli-util/i18next-dts-gen
i18next-dts-gen gen --input src/i18n # Scan this directory for json files and generate index.d.ts type definitions

Throughout my career as a developer I have heard a lot of people agree that testing our code is something that we should all be doing. Conversely, I have not worked at many places that actually do it. Additionally, and surprisingly to me, rarely if ever do you see a tutorial show any kind of testing when they&#x27;re trying to teach something unless they&#x27;re specifically teaching testing.
While I understand that the focus of the lesson may not be testing, I think that if we really want to see testing adopted more widely across our industry then we‚Ä¶</span>

Code must be tracked in a version control system (VCS) like Github, BitBucket, etc. 
One-to-One relationship between the CodeBase and the application. 
There can be multiple deploys of the application.
Different versions of the CodeBase can be in each deployment.

Build: Transform a CodeBase into an executable unit called build.
Release: Combine build with configuration so that it&#x27;s ready to run.

                    <span>Some time ago we started to observe performance issues in our company‚Äôs site built with WordPress. One of the issues we have observed was calling crons in random user requests. It is realized by calling URL https://yourdomain.com/wp-cron.php. Although in this file WordPress calls PHP method fastcgi_finish_request, which sends a response to the user as soon as possible, the cost of calling sub-requests during the main request is worth acknowledging and improving. There are other drawbacks of this:
Calling crons in request context means that it is limited, e.g. by php-fpm setting. We often have limited resources (such as memory or time limit) for HTTP requests. 
What‚Äôs worse, calling cron as http request utilizes resource (e.g. php-fpm pools that might be necessary to handle our traffic).

In today&#x27;s highly connected online world, nothing can function optimally in isolation. Achieving a task (almost) always involves the participation of more than one entity. E-commerce apps need to communicate with payment systems, payment systems need to communicate with banking systems, banking systems need to communicate with customer accounts...do you see the pattern? 
The ability of independent online systems to communicate with one another and share data is the core of what makes online services valuable today. In this post, will look at webhooks. A webhook is one of the many ways to facilitate communication between online services and by the end of this post, you will fully understand what webhooks are, how they work, and when to use them.

After a turbulent initiation into software development, one thing was certain, I was a total novice and had to up my game. It was at this junction that I&#x27;d taken my first Cloud computing course, AWS Fundamentals: Going Cloud-Native. Now, this course taught me multiple concepts such as Failover, Availability zones and Load Balancers. 
But there&#x27;s were a few issues. As the complexity of the infrastructure grew, with it grew:
Necessity to manage the infrastructure.
Need for developing a software development methodology that would allow changes in applications to be easily integrated with existing infrastructure.
The former issue was reflected in the ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Understanding Kubernetes can be difficult or time-consuming. In order to spread knowledges about Cloud technologies I started to create sketchnotes about Kubernetes, then I&#x27;ve auto-published a book and since now I&#x27;ve started a new serie of video! :-)
I imagined a serie of short videos with a mix of sketchnotes and speech.
I think it could be a good way, more visual, with audio &amp; video to explain Kubernetes (and others technologies).
This episode is focused on Kubernetes internal Components: etcd, Scheduler, Kubelet...




The video is in French BUT I done the subtitles in english (and french too).
If you liked the video and are interested to watch another ones, please give me some feedbacks (and you can also subscribe to my Youtube channel, if you want to ‚ù§Ô∏è).
If you are interested, I published all the sketchnotes on Kubernetes (and new ones!) to make a &quot;book&quot; of 165 pages: &quot;Understanding Kubernetes in a visual way&quot;.
If you like theses sketchnotes, you can follow me, I will publish others sketchs shortly :-).</span>

Soon after that, they start to experience mental fatigue, emotional numbness and loss of motivation, which they tend to ignore. These red flags keep on growing in number until developers feel overwhelmed and unable to code.

                    <span>This article outlines my migration from Arch Linux to Debian. The details about the migration are spanned across a few videos, but below is a reasonably short summary.
I moved back from macOS to Linux and I&#x27;m loving it!
Mohammed Ismail Ansari „Éª Mar 18 „Éª 2 min read
#linux
        #macos
        #setup
      
Arch gave me a fresh new direction to explore and experience Linux the way I never did before. I created a couple of reusable artifacts and it in a way became a base for my second YouTube channel.
Things kept breaking, and I found myself spending more time on fixing things than I expected, even with my prior experience with Linux before I spent four years on macOS.




So I started looking out for alternatives and found the exact thing I was looking for.
I couldn&#x27;t lose the control I had over my Linux setup back with Arch by delegating it to a graphical installer. So I installed Debian in the way we usually do install Arch.




All this learning had to be documented somewhere so I created another video talking about the process in a little bit of detail.
Moving to Debian meant re-setting up the entire machine, even deeper than what I had to do back when I moved the factory-installed Windows to a smaller partition to make space for my primary Linux partition.




The new setup took away a few issues I never got fixed, and in exchange, brought with it a few other ones. I talked about the similarities, differences, negatives, and most importantly, the positives of the migration in a separate video, adding another episode to my series Back to Linux.
As I did last time, I&#x27;ll keep my eyes open for ways to improve my setup and workflow, and will keep documenting my learning to be able to share them with the rest of the community.
Needless to say, I&#x27;m loving the alternate universe with Debian. Do throw in your ideas and thoughts in the comments and hopefully, we can learn something from each other.</span>

Today NGINX servers the majority of the world&#x27;s top 1000 websites and while this growth is largely due to, it&#x27;s also because NGINX is relatively easy to get started with.
There are two methods of installing NGINX on Ubuntu 20.04.
Via the operating system&#x27;s build-in packages manager.
Via building NGINX from the source.
In this guide, we‚Äôll build NGINX from the source on Ubuntu 20.04.
To complete this tutorial, you will need to have an Ubuntu 20.04 server. for the sake of simplicity, we&#x27;ll be working as root during this guide.
In order to build NGINX from the source first, we need to install a couple of dependencies for NGINX.

BASH or Bourne Again Shell is an interface(program) between the user and the Operating System. BASH is just an application just like others, but not an ordinary one. It is quite powerful when used to its potential. It is used in various aspects of computing. No, it&#x27;s not only for server admins, but it specializes in that field though. We&#x27;ll see how we can use Bash to perform several tasks quite powerfully. Not just automation, you&#x27;ll be surprised what Bash is capable of.
BASH is just like any other shell such as z-shell, c-shell, Korn shell, and Bourne shell. BASH is a variant or update version of the BOURNE shell. Technically it has quite advanced features than the Bourne shell, such as arithmetic operators, signal handling, command-line completion, and tons of quality of l‚Ä¶</span>

While NextJS is a powerful tool in its own right, adding Express to it makes for a really powerful combo.
You may want to add a custom API to your application without spinning up a separate API service, or you may want to take control of routing, or run some middleware and fetch standard data for your pages before they are served. Perhaps you have an existing API server and you wish to enable it to serve some front end.
This type of set up is documented in NextJS itself: https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server
In the standard example, they use Node&#x27;s http package; we&#x27;ll use Express to take advantage of its middleware and routing capabilities.
I&#x27;ve provided an example barebones integration at https://github.com/alexey-dc/nextjs_express_template

                    <span>Google Cloud Functions is the second most popular serverless execution platform. Similar to AWS Lambda it is stateless, namely you need to access external resources to read or write your applications state. In this post, we will introduce Redis as a database for your Google Cloud functions.                  
This tutorial shows how to build a serverless API with Redis on Google Cloud Functions. The API will simply count the page views and show it in JSON format.

Before Node.js, JavaScript has long been used in web pages and run only by browsers. But now we can execute JavaScript code without a browser with the help of Node.js which is built on Chrome‚Äôs V8 JavaScript engine.
Here‚Äôs a formal definition as given on the nodejs.org
Node.js¬Æ is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome&#x27;s V8 JavaScript engine.

Node is ideal for building highly scalable, data-intensive, and real-time back-end services.

If we think about basic then the API endpoint is one end of the communication channel. We make API endpoints to connect between a frontend and a backend app. From the frontend, we hit the URL and using the backend we send data through API. This is how we communicate.
In this article, we are going to build a rest API. But before that let&#x27;s see an API. There are tons of fake APIs to practice your skills.

                    <span>Ever made a node application?
Chances are, you might have needed PM2, but didn&#x27;t know about it yet.
PM2 is a fantastic process manager for node scripts, meaning it can auto-start them, keep them running, and load-balance it even!
That sounds amazing, doesn&#x27;t it?
To install PM2, we must have Node and NPM installed.
We can then go ahead and install pm2 using the following command.
sudo npm i -g pm2

Let&#x27;s just make a super simple node script to test out how this is going to work. Here is a hello world application in node:
const express &#x3D; require(&#x27;express&#x27;);
const app &#x3D; express();

app.get(&#x27;/&#x27;, (req, res) &#x3D;&gt; res.send(&#x27;Hello World!&#x27;));
app.listen(3000, () &#x3D;&gt; console.log(&#x27;Server ready&#x27;));

Now, if we run the node command for this file:
node index.js

We can visit our browser and see the website.

However, if we now cancel this script, we won&#x27;t be able to see the website anymore.
Instead of running the node script, we can specify pm2 to start the script and even provide a useful name for this app.
pm2 start index.js --name&#x3D;test


Our terminal now is clean, so we can do other stuff, but looking at our website, it&#x27;s back working again!
Now that we have our script running, let&#x27;s see some useful commands.
The first one might be stopping an instance for whatever reason.
test in this command is the name of the script.
pm2 stop test


Now our website will give us a bad gateway again.
Another thing we can do is restart a node script. Let&#x27;s say you made some changes to the file.
pm2 restart test

That restart will reboot the script and stop/start it.

Another great option is to list all instances running.
pm2 list


And the last one I want to note is the log function. Sometimes you might have some issues where the app might be starting but stops immediately.
That&#x27;s where the log function is mighty.
pm2 logs


PM2 is a super powerful process manager for node scripts on Linux systems.

Organizations have different criteria when selecting a SAST tool, and of course, it should support the technology stack of your current organization or team.

There&#x27;s been a lot of articles these past couple of years about &quot;functional programming&quot; in JavaScript, and for some reason these are mostly concerned with immutability, sets, map/reduce, and so on.

What was missing for me, was a functional perspective on IOC and dependency injection.

                    <span>What is the dependency inversion principle?


The dependency inversion principle is one of the standard guiding rules of software design and development to ensure component extensibility and loosely-coupled components.
Simply said, the dependency inversion principle states that we need to rely on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
System coupling is defined as the constraining state of one item to another item inside a system. Coupling occurs on context information. For example, in an air-conditioner, the compressor is said to be coupled to the internal cooling refrigerant and cooling mechanism, since these components together make up the entirety of the cooling system.
Coupling can be of two types: tight coupling and loose coupling. These refer to how a system would react ‚Ä¶</span>

Before discussing dependency injection lets understand what are dependencies first
Dependencies are services or objects that the class needs to perform its function
Dependency Injection is a design pattern in which a class/ component request dependencies from external sources rather than creating them.
In Angular, Component or services are injected with dependencies via the constructor arguments.  Angular DI&#x27;s framework will provide dependencies calling the factory function to instantiate the dependencies. 
How Services are exposed to Inject?
Its using @Injectable decorator and dependency injection provider which is declared in service.

In the above service named AngProvidedDepService the if provided In is removed then you will get following error

                    <span>Introduction


Most of us have come across terms like multithreading, parallel processing, multiprocessing, concurrency, etc., though each of these terms has its own meaning. In a broader sense, we need these because we want to avoid some kind of latency (or have an illusion of doing so) in the execution of regular programs.
To do this, we try to write code that doesn‚Äôt necessarily runs in order (non-sequential) and all this boils down to two different concepts ‚Äî concurrency and parallelism.
I came across concurrency when I was trying to download ~5000 images from the web. I had collected image URLs from Flickr, and these images had to be passed on to a team doing annotation (labelling).
This is how a sequential program to download images would look like:
import requests

                    <span>I, sometimes, love being as a researcher. In just a minute or two, my machine, oftentimes, ended up be a mess. Hearing of Fedora thirty-four which has just officially launched, doing a fresh install of the operating system (OS) had been emerging in my mind, all the time. But how could clean installation clean up the mess? Nay, that is not possible! Once I got my hands dirty, everything will not be alright. Consequently, I have thoughts of keeping myself away from messing around for this time.
As many of people in many different communities have mentioned what is new in the thirty-four edition, followed by how-tos when installing Fedora for the first time, or even again, I have nothing more to share. Still and all, it is rather not a bad idea to capture and talk about decisions I have made.‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>What is a Middleware?:


According to wikiperdia, 
Middleware is a type of computer software that provides services to software applications beyond those available from the operating system. It can be described as &quot;software glue&quot;.
In our case, express js middleware is a functionality that runs between a request to the server and the response from the server.
Built-in Middleware:
express.static: serves static assets such as HTML files, images, and so on.
express.json: parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.
express.urlencoded: parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads.
Third Party Middleware:
Middleware installed via npm
Custom Middleware:
Created by you - the developer - for a project.
Application or Route Level:




const express &#x3D; require(&#x27;express&#x27;);

//Start express app.
const app &#x3D; expree();

//Apply a single middleware
app.use(middleware);

//Apply multiple middleware
app.use(middleware1, middleware2);

//Or via an array 
const middlewareArr &#x3D; [middleware1, middleware2];
app.use(middlewareArr);

Endpoint Level:




//Apply a single middleware
app.get(&#x27;/&#x27;, middleware, (res, req) &#x3D;&gt; {};

//Apply multiple middleware
app.get(&#x27;/&#x27;, middleware1, middleware2, (res, req) &#x3D;&gt; {};

//Or via an array 
const middlewareArr &#x3D; [middleware1, middleware2];
app.get(&#x27;/&#x27;, middlewareArr, (res, req) &#x3D;&gt; {};</span>

                    <span>What is ESLint?


ESLint is an open-source Javascript linting utility originally created by Nicholas C. Zakas in June 2013. It is frequently used to find problematic patterns or code that doesn‚Äôt adhere to certain style guidelines. ESLint is written using Node.js to provide a fast runtime environment and easy installation via npm.
JavaScript, being a dynamic and loosely-typed language, is especially prone to developer error. ESLint lets you put guidelines over coding standard and helps you to minimize those errors. The main reason for imposing those guide is because every developer has her style of writing (like naming conventions/tabs/single or double quotes for a string). And, with different styling techniques, your codebase may look weird, more error-prone and vulnerable. Especially whe‚Ä¶</span>

Some things you may not know about me: I worked alongside network engineers and cybersecurity professionals for a while before deciding that Software Engineering was the technical discipline that I was drawn to.
When I went back to school to &quot;make it official&quot; (even though I&#x27;ve been a software engineer for years) I picked Software Engineering and Security as my major, because I hadn&#x27;t quite dropped that interest in security.
It never came up in real life until I joined my current team, where my actual title is Senior Product Security Engineer. It was super cool to finally get to apply things from my education to my day to day work.
At this point, I have only a capstone course left in my degree, so I know about as much information as a baccalaureate software security program ‚Ä¶</span>

Our lives are so dependent on the internet, knowingly or unknowingly, we put out a lot of information onto the internet which makes it easier for the attackers or ‚ÄúHackers‚Äù to target you. More Information leads to easier targeting of us and our systems. A lot of bank frauds, or any kind of financial frauds, happen mostly due to the information available on the internet and finding other ways to get information from our life. We overlook these small details and give out information that the malicious attackers turn to their advantage.

                    <span>I recently posted about @okikio/animate, a new Animation library that uses the Web Animation API (WAAPI) to create smooth, and highly performant animation.

Well a major limitation of the Web Animation API and consequently @okikio/animate, was that it didn&#x27;t support custom easing, this limitation is on the verge of being removed.

Yeah, you can hack it with keyframes today, but it&#x27;d be nice if it could be could be used within keyframes. Something like linear-easing(0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1) or whatever would be enough.

Here&#x27;s a little demo to test that https://static-misc-3.glitch.me/linear-easing/.
Cases like bounce are tricky due to sudden changes of direction, but 50 points seems to do well.
View on GitHub
Using the fact that WAAPI allows for linear easing, I created a small function that generates a set of arrays that create custom easing effects like bounce, elastic, and spring. As of right now it builds on top of @okikio/animate but that isn&#x27;t absolutely necessary, it just may not be as comfortable as using it with @okikio/animate. 
You can view a demo below,




As of right now if I add this to the @okikio/animate library it will more than double the size of the library (Note: treeshaking the actual package @okikio/animate while custom easing isn&#x27;t in use will cause it to excluded from the final build reducing the size down to ~5.79 KB).
I&#x27;m not sure if I should make Custom Easing a separate package or build it directly into @okikio/animate, please tell me what you think in the comments below.

                    <span>Hi, I want to write about some technical discussion about system designs, architecture designs, programming techniques and how to deal with troubles in real-world but I&#x27;ve found that it is very difficult to just explain topics via multiple arbitrary and unconnected examples. I&#x27;ve got some topics in my mind but I cannot convey them into words. My writing is not good enough. So I&#x27;m thinking of implementing some real product while writing about it at a same time. I can post all the design considerations here and will receive feedbacks which will help me (and maybe other people) a lot.
The problem is that I cannot think of any ideas about software/applications that are not only practical but also useful for real-life use cases. Simple case studies are good but I&#x27;m afraid of that the readers will lose the interest. So any suggestion would be welcome and appreciate.
Thank you very much.</span>

Over a year ago, a colleague of mine and me were searching for a javascript-component capable for tree-rendering. There were a few must-have aspects we were looking for:
Zero runtime-dependencies (especially no JQuery)
Actively maintained
Framework-agnostic
Good integration with modern bundlers
These requirements did already reduce the number of possible libraries to a considerable degree. In addition, we had to consider the requirements of our product as well:
Text-search through tree-nodes
Mode where the tree is rendered in a container
Dropdown-mode for single-selection
Dropdown-mode for multi-selection
Neither did any component meet our requirements, nor did using two libraries for the different use-cases turn out to be sufficient. So we started considering the effort of ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Today in this digital era developing a web application requires a reliable and dependable software stack. Modern-day developers are utilizing a blend of advanced technologies to get swifter and enhanced outcomes through their projects.
Increasing the use of MEAN Stack is one of the primary examples of this scenario. MEAN JS is utilized to craft robust and scalable web applications. Let‚Äôs explore what exactly is Mean Stack and how it can assist your business.
What is the MEAN stack?
Mean stack is the compilation and synergy of technologies applied to build web applications. MEAN is used by several Web App Development Companies, and it precisely stands for ‚ÄúMongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js.‚Äù
How does Mean stack architecture work?

The Mean Stack Architecture works in five stages.
Stage 1: Angular as a client-side language is the foremost one to work on the client request.
Stage 2: The client request then goes into NodeJS being the JavaScript server-side language.
Stage 3: ExpressJS is then into the process and makes a database request.
Stage 4: Then MongoDB retrieves the data and sends the response to ExpressJS.
Stage 5: NodeJS returns the data to the AngularJS to showcase the outcomes, and in return, the data is taken back from the ExpressJS.

npm install --save cookieconsent

Now install ngx-cookieconsent via:
npm install --save ngx-cookieconsent

Once installed you need to import the main module app.module.ts:
import {NgcCookieConsentModule} from &#x27;ngx-cookieconsent&#x27;;

Add this import to imports of @NgModule on the same file app.module.ts
imports: [NgcCookieConsentModule.forRoot(cookieConfig), ...], 

After adding above import in @NgModule your code will look like this-
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],
  imports: [NgcCookieConsentModule.forRoot(cookieConfig), ...],  
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})

Now add below code in the same file app.module.ts -

This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating your Angular application using Routers. We&#x27;ll learn the basics of Router outlets, navigations, routes, and paths to generate a complete Angular Single Page Application (SPA).  
For you to be able to follow this tutorial along, it&#x27;ll be a necessity to have basic knowledge of Angular.
Angular Router is a core part of Angular that aids in building a single-page application. It&#x27;s located in the @angular/router package.  
It has a complete routing library for constructing multiple route outlets. It also supports several features such as lazy loading and routing guards for access control et cetera.
Routes are objects. At the lowest level, they comprise Angular components and paths, and sometimes redirectTo. This provides ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Creating production-ready containers for use in commercial-grade apps can be a far cry from the &quot;get started with Node.js and Docker&quot;-type of tutorials that are common around the Internet. Those guides are great for introducing all the advantages of Docker containers in modern cloud-native development, but creating a container that passes muster in a large-scale application in production is a different story. 
For production-ready containers, there are three key things you want to optimise for when creating a container:
Image Size üì¶
Build Speed üê¢
Security üîê
Image size and build speed ensure that your containers can move through CI/CD and test pipelines easily and efficiently. Security is obviously critical in today&#x27;s software supply chain, and containers have their own set of security i‚Ä¶</span>

So want to learn how to install multiple versions of PHP on the Ubuntu system? Okay, that‚Äôs great.
Let‚Äôs assume, you have
OS: Ubuntu 16.04
PHP: 7.1 (PHP-FPM)
Nginx: 1.10
And want to install PHP 7.2.
Run the following commands to update the PHP repository &amp; the Ubuntu system
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt update

Now you are able to install the new version of PHP

Apple: WebKit Bugs Exploited to Hack Older iPhones


Earlier in this series, we covered the WebKit bug, as it seems, older iPhones are vulnerable. Therefore, you should update your device if your iPhone device is &quot;old&quot;.
Excerpt from the article:
The two WebKit bugs (CVE-2021-30761 and CVE-2021-30762) are memory corruption and use-after-free issues that Apple says were fixed with improved state management.

At first, you might think it&#x27;s impossible to achieve this, but, it&#x27;s software, you can find a way to make it do weird things.

The option of choosing the IAM database authentication is not a good fit for my scenario. So I have checked the service in AWS as AWS Secret Manager which helps to store and rotate the database credentials in terms of username and password not as authentication token.

                    <span>In this tutorial, I‚Äôm going to start the process of making a prototype using mock data. My goal at the end of the series is to have quickly mocked data for a prototype while binding it to the UI. As a result, the data can be used across the app and there is only one point of maintenance. 
When I‚Äôm done with the series, I will have one data set that I can use to create demo components of my application.
If you are a front-end developer or designer who codes and working without the back-end API for a proof of concept or prototype in the browser, this is for you. In order to complete this tutorial, you‚Äôll need to have a good understanding of HTML. And how to start an Angular application.

Using Azure Pipeline
Developers test software in a local environment using servers such as LAMP, WAMP, node, IIS, and Apache. Local deployment is good in terms of fast development and debugging, but we can‚Äôt ship our physical machines to the client in order to access to the application üòÇ. We have to deploy an application to a web server/cloud in order to make it accessible to the end user on their preferred platform (mobile, desktop, etc).
A variety of cloud providers exist in the current market, the most popular being Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, AWS. These providers offer an unbeatable combination of ease, speed, and automation, so if you have not deployed using such a platform, then this is the article for you!

                    <span>In the past decade, frontend frameworks have dramatically evolved and some of them are game changers. These frameworks not just create cross-platform apps easily but are better for future development too. But when it comes to choosing popular Javascript frameworks in 2021, Vue and angular stand out. With lots of benefits, you might be confused to choose the best framework for business, so here we will discuss both Javascript frameworks on the basis of various parameters. But before digging to the comparison, let‚Äôs see an overview of each Vue and Angular.

                    <span>LightDM is a light display manager for Linux, which have lots of different greeters/themes to choose. One of these greeters is the previously known as lightdm webkit2 greeter, then named lightdm web greeter, a greeter that allows theming with web technologies like HTML and JavaScript.
Sadly, this greeter was abandoned as Antergos team didn‚Äôt have time to develop their distro. The latest version, 2.2.5 uses an outdated WebKit engine, which could cause some new web technologies to not work in the greeter. Also, the Debian package is not working, a shame.
Luckily, Antergos team were developing a 3.0.0 version, getting rid of WebKit and using the QtWebEngine, based on Chromium, with Python. So, I decided to update some things about this greeter based on this pre-release.
Whither is the ‚Äúnew‚Äù tool that 3.0.0 would be using, developed by Antergos, allows to create web applications in a similar way to Electron.js, but in Python.
So, I‚Äôm here to introduce a new pre-release. You can install it from the GitHub Repository. Though, you need to install the whither sdk to run it.
Command line arguments support, such as ‚Äî-help, ‚Äî-theme, ‚Äî-debug and others
Some fixes with the LightDM API, as power functions didn‚Äôt work
Man pages updated
Every local request is made through web-greeter:/ url scheme
WebKit no longer here. Replaced with Chromium
Some API changes. 2.2.5 deprecated functions and globals were removed
If you are using LightDM, I recommend you to use this greeter, try some themes and create your own!

                    <span>We all are asked to use visual studio code and other rich looking editors as a beginners text editor or an IDE but that makes a habit of a rich and pleasing interface of running and debugging programs, and that is the reason we don&#x27;t feel good to use command line or the terminal. Terminal or Command line are quite important to learn and are powerful as well.  
Vim is a text editor, not any text editor but a special and one of the fastest out there, if you use it wisely. Vim can be used in the terminal which means it can run terminal commands inside the editor interface. That makes it quite a great option to improve your terminal command skills and also for enhancing your Linux knowledge. You can run program files from vim itself just by a few keystrokes.

                    <span>I know in Windows, &quot;file extensions&quot;, the part of a file name after the final period in the file name, are more than just part of the file name, they also act as metadata to tell Windows what kind of file the document should be treated as, and what apps to open them in (i.e. what apps are associated with those file types).
However, I want to start moving to Linux (Ubuntu) which I installed on my PC a while back, so, I recently tried making a new file (&quot;extensionless&quot;), and I wanted to make it a different type, so I tested to see if that would work by testing by renaming it .go, so I could try to open it in VSCode like I normally would on WIndows.
I look up multiple searches, involving how to change the file extension (only getting results using command line), and eventually coming over to a horrifying S.O. answer that horrified me, it gave me the info that &quot;extensions&quot; (file types) are determined by header.
There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way in the &quot;Files&quot; file manager for Ubuntu to change the header type.

What I want is a program that can give me a simple GUI to edit the file type of a file so I can easily go between one or the other as needed/wanted.

                    <span>While web builders have been around for a long time, it wasn‚Äôt until recently that they became practical for professional use. Closing the gap between design and code has become the north star for many companies and we are seeing a wave of tools that deliver on this promise.</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Web fonts are often terrible for web performance and none of the font loading strategies are particularly effective to address that. Upcoming font options may finally deliver on the promise of making it easier to align fallback fonts to the final fonts.</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
