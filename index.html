                    <span>Angular is a front-end technology, so it becomes essential to find and utilize the finest resources globally when building web applications. End-user experience is definitely going to be affected directly by this!
When looking for an outsourcing Angular Full stack developer, there are few things one should always keep in mind. The Angular Developer must be capable of upscaling your product development capabilities.
To accomplish this goal, there are numerous options available to choose from, for example, Freelancing, in-house Angular Developers, hiring remote offshore developers, or outsourcing from any globally accredited Angular development company.

It allows users to authenticate themselves using Google and then purchase spare parts and essentials for automobiles.
With TalkJS, AllParts have implemented a buyer-seller chat that the customers can use to resolve queries, get recommendations or ask general questions. It is not a full-fledged application but goes well with this tutorial. You can set up your project from GitHub before getting started and if you’ve already done that, let’s get going.

                    <span>I want to preface all of this by saying I&#x27;m a pretty new developer. If there&#x27;s any clarification needed because my question is not preicse enough I&#x27;ll gladly provide!
So as part of my current education we&#x27;re doing something they call pop-up internship where you go to visit a company for a day or two and run through a couple different departments to get a feel for how different companies might tackle some of the daily tasks they encounter.
One company in particular had an app in development that really got me interested. They were building a web application for one of their customers based on the Angular framework from what I understand. The backend/serverside code was written in Java. The interesting part is that they used some way to turn the expoted Java-WAR into a file they would include in the Angular project. This allowed them to call methods from that service and, what was the most interesting to me, the classes for the project were only defined in that Java code yet perfectly usable in that Angular code. I saw some kind of service URL in the code which I assume is somehow being used to make the actual calls in some way.
Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t able to dig deep enough/get into the deeper questions I had regarding the whole procedure. 
I don&#x27;t have any experience with Java, writing mostly little PHP and C# applications so far so I wondered - is a model like this possible to set up with Angular and PHP? If yes, where do I need to look in terms of guidance to set something like that up with my Angular project? What are some key things I need to know before tackling something like this? Is it even worth doing like that?
There&#x27;s a lot floating in my head right now regarding this because this is kinda exciting to me, any and all help would be greatly appreciated</span>

                    <span>What is &quot;infrastructure-as-code&quot;?


To keep the concept simple, think of your infrastructure as a picture (end-state) and the main characteristics (configuration) that you would use to describe it.
Using this information you should be able to reproduce the picture any time you need, and the result should always be the same as the original.
There are several tools and methods to implement this approach but the most important thing to consider is that you also need to adapt your management procedures to switch from the traditional imperative model to the infrastructure-as-code declarative model.
To successfully implement infrastructure-as-code special attention must be paid to the selection of supporting tools and the definition of the conceptual model that will represent the managed environ…</span>

Besides strong Dev/prod parity, using Heroku CI comes with many benefits key of which include;
Parallel Test Runs.
Browser tests and User Acceptance Tests.
Seamless integration with Heroku pipelines.
Easy customization of test dependencies in the test environment.
A Simple Integrated Solution (integration, hosting and deployment)
Simple, prescriptive developer experience in modern CI/CD solutions
Management support.

Use sudo when needed.
Install perl-IPC-Cmd and perl-Test-Simple:
sudo yum install perl-IPC-Cmd perl-Test-Simple

Go to OpenSSL&#x27;s download page and copy the link to the latest version. At this time it&#x27;s 3.0.0. Then run (adapt the command to reflect your version):
cd /usr/src
wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-3.0.0.tar.gz
tar -zxf openssl-3.0.0.tar.gz
rm openssl-3.0.0.tar.gz

Compile, make, test and install OpenSSL:
cd /usr/src/openssl-3.0.0
./config
make
make test
make install

Regardless of whether you need to just list pods, debug node, manage RBAC or whatever else, kubectl can do it.

There are hundreds of frameworks and dozens of libraries that help to overcome the complexity of low-level details in order to focus on something more important and even more sophisticated. I’m talking about business logic. And today I’ll try to convince you that static code analysis is the one thing that not only can make your coding life more pleasant but help the business to build more robust processes as well.
Let’s make something clear. What does business value the most in a software system? Is it performance? The modern technologies? Or maybe documentation? Actually, business cares about two things.
The income the software gets.
The maintainability.
The first one is pretty obvious. The essential goal of any company is to earn mon…</span>

                    <span>Jaeger is an open-source end-to-end distributed tracing tool for microservices architecture. On the other hand, Elastic APM is an application performance monitoring system that is built on top of the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Beats). In this article, let&#x27;s explore their key features, differences, and alternatives.
Application performance monitoring is the process of keeping your app&#x27;s health in check. APM tools enable you to be proactive about meeting the demands of your customers. There are many components to a good APM tool like metrics monitoring, distributed tracing, log management, alert systems, etc.
Jaeger and Elastic APM are both popular tools in the domain of application performance monitoring. But both have different scope and use-cases.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve spent the last few weeks researching how to connect event busses in two different AWS accounts using the CDK. Most of the information that I&#x27;ve found has just been CloudFormation templates, which is fine, but some of the resources you have to create in CloudFormation are automatically created in the CDK.
Now that I&#x27;ve solved the problem, I&#x27;d like to help the next unfortunate sole that needs to implement this. Fortunately the final solution isn&#x27;t that complicated.
This article leaves out some boilerplate code, like creating the stacks. For the full source go to: https://github.com/theBenForce/post-samples/tree/article/cross-account-event-bus

                    <span>Deploying infrastructure manually is an outdated practice. Using Terraform to automate manual deployment is the new normal. In this blog, we have explained in detail, how to create your first module using Terraform.
Before the advent of cloud and DevOps, most companies managed and deployed their infrastructure manually. This used to be risky because not only was it error-prone, it also slowed down the entire infrastructure cycle. The good news is that now, most companies are not deploying infrastructure manually but instead using tools like Terraform. In this blog, we are going to cover Terraform and the use of terraform modules.

Story of the month: Do most SaaS cloud cost tools really suck?
It makes sense for industry players to be skeptical about cloud cost optimization tools. It’s true that many solutions on the market are pretty complicated and steal away a great deal of time for onboarding and training.
But allocating, analyzing, and forecasting cloud costs is time-consuming as well. You have to research pricing plans, make infrastructure changes, create new instances, and do all the other things tha…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using SFML; actually writing a simple program with it. It sucks... for some cases.
It&#x27;s pretty easy to work with; you get a while loop (while (window.isOpen())) and in that loop you can add an event handler for key presses, etc. So with some function magic or huge if statements, you can write a pretty good game!
So, for 2D games yes, else? possible but there are alternatives; Panda3D, Torque, some more I found on the internet.
Final Thoughts; I think it&#x27;s a great 2D game engine!

                    <span>What is &quot;infrastructure-as-code&quot;?


To keep the concept simple, think of your infrastructure as a picture (end-state) and the main characteristics (configuration) that you would use to describe it.
Using this information you should be able to reproduce the picture any time you need, and the result should always be the same as the original.
There are several tools and methods to implement this approach but the most important thing to consider is that you also need to adapt your management procedures to switch from the traditional imperative model to the infrastructure-as-code declarative model.
To successfully implement infrastructure-as-code special attention must be paid to the selection of supporting tools and the definition of the conceptual model that will represent the managed environ…</span>

I got a better idea for this idea (This sentence already makes me laugh 😆) and...
I got writer&#x27;s block while writing &quot;variables in 5 different programming languages&quot; and got this idea so I wrote this one.
so I don&#x27;t think &quot;ABC&#x27;s of code&quot; will be happening any time soon...

                    <span>Ever felt the need of hiding stuff from the world. In this article, I&#x27;ll show you how you can encrypt and decrypt your data using the AES Encryption technique. We&#x27;ll use the openssl command for this purpose.
Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt data. By using symmetric encryption algorithms, data is converted to a form that cannot be understood by anyone who does not possess the secret key to decrypt it.
Advanced Encryption Standard (also known as Rijndael), is one of the best symmetric encryption algorithm. AES is a block encryption algorithm and thus supports five modes which are as follows:
ECB mode: Electronic Code Book mode
CBC mode: Cipher Block Chaining mode
CFB mode: Cipher Feedback mode

In this section, we&#x27;ll go through creating and configuring a remote MongoDB instance.
Instead of installing a local MongoDB instance, we&#x27;ll use Atlas which is MongoDB&#x27;s official database-as-a-service.
Create a MongoDB Atlas account here.
Create a cluster. For new accounts, you can use the forever free tier!
Create the super admin user.
To better visualize our data, we&#x27;ll be using the official GUI for MongoDB, Compass.

                    <span>In this article, We will see how we can optimize our Node.js applications with clustering. Later we&#x27;ll also do some benchmarks!
Node.js is single threaded by default and hence only utilizes one cpu core for that thread. So, to take advantage of all the cores available we need to launch a cluster of Node.js processes.
For this we can use the native cluster module which creates several child processes (workers) that operate parallelly. Each generated process has it&#x27;s own event loop, V8 instance and memory. The primary process and worker process communicate with each other via IPC (Inter-Process Communication).

                    <span>It’s been almost a year since I last wrote about Nines tech choices. I wanted to give a brief update on what’s changed and what’s stayed. 
This was the one piece of the puzzle I liked the most from building Nine. Since the frontend is a static Next.js app using typescript, GraphQL pairs perfectly and having all the data and mutations in the frontend static typed is awesome!
The frontend for Nine being static is really important and has been a great experience. 
There is one niggle that I need to sort out at the moment though, the frontend deploy is getting slow. We’re currently building several thousand static pages, what’s worse though, it’s growing as we get more stores online.
As you might tell from the title of this post, the backend API written in node and typescript is gone.

                    <span>I have been using JavaScript for most of my career, but I recently started working at a company that uses Python for most of its stack. Even though Python is easy to get started with, a couple of quirks are easy to get stuck on, and some best practices that I wish I knew earlier. Here is a list of my most significant hurdles and what I learned from the perspective of a JavaScript developer. Hopefully, it&#x27;s useful for anyone else doing the same transition.
First, let&#x27;s take a quick look at similar concepts with different names in the two languages.
Errors in JavaScript are called Exceptions in Python. They are otherwise identical in any meaningful way.
null in JavaScript is None in Python. There is no equivalent of undefined in Python.

                    <span>How to send message to specific discord&#x27;s channel from your server application?


Had you wonder how to send the log / messages from the server application to discord channel? In my personal poject I use NodeJs for the server side, each of the important details from the server will be sent to my discord&#x27;s channel. For instance, each time my user made a payment or register for my app. I am about to demonstrate how exactly I did it.
I use the ES6 dicipline for my application.
Packages I will be using are axios, and nodemon.
Initiate a project by npm init -y.
get the webhok url by going to your channel&#x27;s settings -&gt; integration -&gt; create webhook.
start coding.
In this case I will use the method of HTTP POST request to the webhook.
bash you can simply do :
#!/bin/sh
url &#x3D; &quot;thewebhookurl&quot;

curl -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -X POST -d &#x27;{&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&#x27;&quot;YOUR WHAT EVER MESSAGE &quot;&#x27;&quot;}&#x27; $url


but in nodejs,

 log(msg) {
        let webhook_url &#x3D; &#x27;thewebhoooklink&#x27;;

        let params &#x3D; {
            username: &#x27;ABC&#x27;,
            content: msg,
        };

        return axios({
            method: &#x27;POST&#x27;,
            headers: {
                &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;,
            },
            data: JSON.stringify(params),
            url: webhook_url,
        });
    }

and it should work but calling the function log(&#x27;something something&#x27;);
HAPPY CODING!</span>

                    <span>Fetching data from an API either from an external source or from the Backend of your application can be done in many ways.
In this Quick guide, I would show you how to fetch data in a react app by making an HTTP request to a REST API using 4 different patterns.
Before I begin, let’s have a refresher on what REST APIs are:
What is a REST API?
A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for “REpresentational State Transfer”.
In this guide, we would be making use of the Github REST API and its sample response looks like this:

&quot;login&quot;: &quot;jideabdqudus&quot;,

When deploying applications on netlify, we usually add our app’s environment variables manually. And whenever there’s a need to update it, we have to go back there to netlify to do it. With Doppler, an organization/team or individuals can manage their application’s environment variables easily. In this article, we will be learning how to integrate Doppler with Netlify.
In this article, we will clone a mini e-commerce project built with Reactjs that uses firebase for authentication from Github, save the app’s environment variables in a doppler workspace and sync it with netlify. To achieve this, we will set up a doppler account, create a workspace, add a project to the workspace and sync it with netlify.

                    <span>Opa!! Vamos avançar em nossa série. Hoje aprenderemos como controlar o acesso com filtro de IP e autenticação interna.
Você pode bloquear um IP (ou faixa de IP) utilizando a diretiva deny. Além do IP, é possível também utilizar o CIDR para bloquear requisições.
# Syntax: deny address | CIDR | unix: | all;
# Default: —
# Context: http, server, location, limit_except
#
# Bloqueia um IP específico
deny 127.0.0.1;

# Bloqueia faixa 142.250.218.0 - 142.250.218.255
deny 142.250.218.0/24;

# Bloqueia uma faixa de IP do tipo IPV6
deny 2001:0db8::/32;

# Bloqueia todos os acessos
deny all;

Bloqueando acesso a arquivos
Com o deny, também é possível bloquear acesso aos arquivos ou a um diretório. Basta utilizar a diretiva dentro do contexto location, por exemplo.

as I highlighted on the Dev Interrupted Podcast , only within the last decade has it come to be widely accepted and used, though many organizations are yet to use the concept. While many people still remain skeptical of open source, its growing popularity and use is undeniable.
For many developers, open source is “the one true way”, almost a religion. Many of the world’s best and brightest developers devote themselves to creating and advancing the cause of open source projects. There are any number of foundations and organizations — from The Apache Software Foundation to the .NET Foundation — that openly support open source.

If you’re planning to build a native Android app that requires users to log in, you should use Auth0. 
Implementing user login/logout often turns into its own project. Just implementing the many ways users want to log in can easily take a lot of time. You’d also have to deal with issues such as user management, scaling, and security, each of which could have its own article.
With Auth0 and a few lines of code, your app can have a full-featured system that supports logging in with a basic username/password combination, single sign-on and social accounts, passwordless login, biometrics, and more. You won’t have to handle the “behind the scenes” issues, either!

About four weeks after the launch we enabled the download feature on the site so everyone can get the latest dataset in JSON and CSV format. Furthermore there’s now a weekly sync of these results to a dedicated github repo as well.
As initially announced, but not yet implemented during that time, we built our own FX data API to provide free and public currency data (yes, you can use it as well if you like!) for the Forex calculations taking place on the dataset in the salary_in_usd column.

A malware which can steal your money is not something you&#x27;ll want to hear and neither is a software bug in your favorite device. Quite frankly, these among others is what this week&#x27;s review is all about.

Conclusion
Code review is a part of regular development practices for any corporation. However, adding security elements to the code review is the most effective measure in preventing vulnerabilities, even before the first commit. Additionally, the code review process provides itself with sharing security best practices amongst a development team. Finally, it produces &#x27;lessons&#x27; that we can learn to prevent future bugs.
The primary purpose of security engineers is to work collaboratively with the rest of the team to figure out a way not to reproduce the same vulnerabilities or at least implement a mechanism to minimize them.

This is also called encrypted streams. 🔐
But how does it work all these exchanges to arrive at a result where my data is in encrypted flows and it is inviolable? 🤔
As a developer, I&#x27;m going to need to understand how all of this works so that I can implement it effectively in my app or website. 👨🏼‍💻
As a security engineer, it is essential to know how it works in order to be sure that there are no potential vulnerabilities in the implementation of my web service. 👷🏼‍♂️
As an individual &quot;general public&quot;, it is classy to know these type of things to shine in society. 😄

If you don&#x27;t know how the algorithm works checkout previous post in this series.
So Without further ado, LET&#x27;S BEGIN!!👨‍💻👩‍💻
Yes, You&#x27;re right! 
three steps:
Convert plaintext into digraphs (i.e., into pair of two letters)
Generate a Cipher Key Matrix
Encrypt plaintext using Cipher Key Matrix and get ciphertext.
 

  
  
  Step: 1 Creating function to convert plaintext into digraphs




  



 
 


  
  
  Now we need to locate index of particular character inside cipher key matrix to perform encryption:




  



 
 


  
  
  Final Step! Running our code from main method:

Passwords have been our main digital authentication method since 1961, though its vulnerability to hacking was demonstrated within one year.
Encrypted password storage and public-key cryptography were developed in the late 60s to early 70s.
But the 1980s brought the first version of &quot;passwordless&quot; authentication. This came in the form of dynamic, one-time passwords (OTP) held on physical fobs.
OTPs eventually developed into two protocols: time-based OTPs (TOTP) and cryptographed hash-based message authentication codes or HMAC OTPs (HOTP). Dynamic OTPs are still widely used as an authentication protocol.
The late 1990s brought single sign-on (SSO) into use. SSO helped organizations manage user authentication across an entire network of applications. However, …</span>

                    <span>What is Passwordless Authentication?
Passwordless authentication is exactly what it sounds like: an authentication strategy to verify user identity without the need for the user to manually enter knowledge-based information.
As we outlined in the previous article in this series, passwordless methodologies have been in use since the 1980&#x27;s, but were ultimately popularized in the 2000&#x27;s as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on (SSO) became standards.
From MFA and SSO to &#x27;passwordless&#x27;
Multi-factor authentication requires users to provide multiple unique ways of identifying themselves, which can include:
  Something the user knows, like an ID number, user name, and/or password
  Something the user has, like a token, authenticator app, ubikey, email address, or phone number

                    <span>Hey friends,
Over the years I have implemented service container architecture in many large-scale front-end apps and it has vastly improved their performance and maintainability. I&#x27;ve finally got around to turning it into an open-source library called &quot;Be Our Guest.&quot; The name is inspired by the Disney song from Beauty and the Beast and the lyric &quot;put our service to the test.&quot;
It is an ASYNC service container that enables your node or browser applications to implement an Inversion of Control architecture for it&#x27;s modules and dependencies. You may be thinking, &quot;why do I need this?&quot;
As an example to illustrate it&#x27;s value, let&#x27;s say we have a module that handles auth within our application. After you construct and register the module it requires a boot step to send some requests to the backend…</span>

                    <span>In this article, We will see how we can optimize our Node.js applications with clustering. Later we&#x27;ll also do some benchmarks!
Node.js is single threaded by default and hence only utilizes one cpu core for that thread. So, to take advantage of all the cores available we need to launch a cluster of Node.js processes.
For this we can use the native cluster module which creates several child processes (workers) that operate parallelly. Each generated process has it&#x27;s own event loop, V8 instance and memory. The primary process and worker process communicate with each other via IPC (Inter-Process Communication).

                    <span>It’s been almost a year since I last wrote about Nines tech choices. I wanted to give a brief update on what’s changed and what’s stayed. 
This was the one piece of the puzzle I liked the most from building Nine. Since the frontend is a static Next.js app using typescript, GraphQL pairs perfectly and having all the data and mutations in the frontend static typed is awesome!
The frontend for Nine being static is really important and has been a great experience. 
There is one niggle that I need to sort out at the moment though, the frontend deploy is getting slow. We’re currently building several thousand static pages, what’s worse though, it’s growing as we get more stores online.
As you might tell from the title of this post, the backend API written in node and typescript is gone.

AllParts is an imaginary e-commerce website that specializes in automobile spare parts and accessories. They have an Angular application that is integrated with Firebase. It allows users to authenticate themselves using Google and then purchase spare parts and essentials for automobiles.
With TalkJS, AllParts have implemented a buyer-seller chat that the customers can use to resolve queries, get recommendations or ask general questions. It is not a full-fledged application but goes well with this tutorial. You can set up your project from GitHub before getting started and if you’ve already done that, let’s get going.

share
Returns a new Observable that multicasts (shares) the original Observable. As long as there is at least one Subscriber this Observable will be subscribed and emitting data. When all subscribers have unsubscribed it will unsubscribe from the source Observable. Because the Observable is multicasting it makes the stream hot.

TypeScript simplifies JavaScript code, making it easier to read and debug. TypeScript provides highly productive development tools for JavaScript IDEs and practices, like static checking. TypeScript makes code easier to read and understand. With TypeScript, we can make a huge improvement over plain JavaScript.
There are many more benefits of TypeScript over Javascript:

                    <span>AWS EC2 load balancer is one of the most popular service offer by Amazon Web Service. In this post we shall be exploring AWS load balancer, types of AWS load balancers, when to use them and how to setup load balancers on AWS Management console.
load Balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 instances) downstream.

1.Spread load across multiple downstream instances
An ELB(EC2 Load Balancer ) is a managed load balancers by AWS. Meaning AWS guarantees that it will be working. AWS takes care of upgrades ,maintenance, high availability across multiple zones. It costs less to setup your own load balancers but it would be a lot of effort on your end.
They are support important for load balancers. They enable the load balancer to know if instances it forward traffic to are available to reply to requests. The health check is done on a port and a route. If  the response is not 200 (OK) ,then the instance is unhealthy.

1.Classic load Balances(V1 -old generation)-2009
Load Balancer can scale but not instantaneously if you have a massive scale to do you need to contact AWS for a &quot;Warm-up&quot;.
For Troubleshooting

                    <span>Introduction


Hello everyone, my name is Dustin, today I want to write a blog about my progress of working with branches in Git. So this is the lab 03, which I have to create 2 parallel branches to work on different aspects of the program.
First off, I needed to decide what to add to my program. At the time, I had a few options like changing code block, or hr, or exit code for my program... So I thought that the exit code is a must that my program needed to have and the code block thing is quite more interesting than hr. After choosing what I needed to do, I had to file 2 issues so I had something to refer back to. 
The 2 issues I was talking about:
First one
Second one
Writing code for these 2 issues are quite straightforward. It took me a few minutes to finish it. However, I&#x27;m not so sure about the inline code block thing, and should ask my professor about it to make sure that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s looking for. 
So, for the first issue, I created a new branch called issue-18 and issue-19 for the second issue. When finishing the first issue, I had to git add and git commit and switched to branch issue-19 to continue coding. As I&#x27;ve done it, I also had to git add and git commit. After that, I had to use merge to merge those 2 branches. 
I used git merge issue-18 which is my first issue, git had no problem merging it. It was fast forward right away. However, for the second issue, when I git merge issue-19, instead of fast forward, Git used three way recursive strategy. Then, I just needed to push it to github so the code will be visible to everyone.

Speaker.app is a batteries-included, quasi-decentralized, alternative free speech audio platform that is compatible on any device that supports a modern web browser.
Rather than a centralized server providing proxying of streams from each participant to other participants (i.e. an MCU / SFU), one can choose to host a network (or &quot;room&quot;) where others can connect to, either publicly or privately.  The network hosting participant&#x27;s web browser acts as the &quot;server&quot; for the other participants to connect to on the given network, and all proxying is done, including message storage and relaying, through that browser.
Public networks are visible in a &quot;network discovery&quot; view, which serves as the default homepage for the application.

                    <span>🔍 Here’s an easy-to-understand analogy to help your non-technical friends and customers understand public keys and private keys, and how they relate to cryptography and digital signatures.



  
  
  
If you work in cybersecurity or any computer-related field, sooner or later, you’ll have to explain public-key cryptography and digital signatures to non-technical people. With the recent rise of remote work and stories about system breaches, computer security has become a topic of discussion even among laypeople.
After trying to explain public-key cryptography and digital signatures to some clients with varying degrees of success, I wanted to develop an analogy that explained them and was easy to remember. I’ve found that even techies get confused by the formal definitions, and many non-technical explanations just seem unsatisfying.
That’s when I stumbled upon Panayotis Vryonis’ article, Public-key cryptography for non-geeks. It became my go-to analogy until my computer science professor, Dr. Robin Dawes pointed out a flaw. I refined it with his help, and a suggestion from Matthew Ernest, and the result is below. I hope you find it helpful when trying to explain these concepts to anyone!
Imagine a box with a special lock, as pictured below:

The lock has three positions:
When the lock is at the “9:00” position, the box is locked, and its contents are inaccessible.
When the lock is at the “12:00” position, the box is unlocked, which means you can open it and view its contents.
When the lock is at the “3:00” position, the box is locked, and its contents are inaccessible.
In order to avoid wandering into endless “What if...?” tangents, assume that it’s prohibitively costly to pick the lock or break the box.

A dictionary is a common data structure in a programming language. As JavaScript developers, it’s important to work with type-safe dictionaries because there will be conflicts or unexpected issues if we store different types of data within the same dictionary.
In this article, we’ll cover how to build a type-safe dictionary using TypeScript.
First of all, we need to know what a dictionary is. In a programming language, a dictionary is a typical data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. JavaScript, however, does not offer a Dictionary type. Thankfully, we can create a type-safe dictionary in a few simple ways.
Object types in JavaScript


There are two primary ways to create a dictionary in JavaScript: using the Object type and using key-value pairs. The…</span>

                    <span>Using reducers in the React Context api leaves a lot of room for error, even when using TypeScript. A reducer takes a single argument and returns a state. The common format for the argument is an object with an action property and a payload or value property. The action&#x27;s value is generally a string such as setTitle. In the case of action:&#x27;setTitle&#x27;, the value would then be the title you want to set on the state object. The problems with this approach are:
You have to look back at the reducer to see what the correct spelling and valid values of action are.
There is no type checking of the values that are linked with the action.
This article assumes that you have a basic familiarity with React, useReducer, and TypeScript.

                    <span>Hi everyone! My name is Itay and I’m a fullstack developer who specializes in back-of-the-frontend React.js code.
In this shot, I’ll show you the usages of the useCallback hook for better performance of your application, and explain why you should use it.
For a start, let’s look at this code:
export function MyComponent () {
    const [numericState, setNumber] &#x3D; useState(0);
    const handleClick &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
        setNumber(x &#x3D;&gt; x%2 +1);
    }
    return (
        
        Click Me
        {numbericState}
        
    )
}

What’s wrong with this code? It’s not completely optimized. The handle click function is changing on every render!
That would be the equivalent of writing the following class based component:

                    <span>Vue performs DOM updates asynchronously! But what does mean?
I will begin by explain you what is going on if we don&#x27;t use an async update queue.
Imagine that we have an array and we show it into the DOM, each time we push a new item, we will render the DOM.

It&#x27;s not really dramatic if we only add some items. But imagine if we decide to add 1000 items in this array at the same moment, we will render our DOM 1000 times! Your DOM will explode 🤯.
We don&#x27;t really need to update the DOM 1000 times, we only need one time, and we should only update it when we finish to add all items!
Vue performs DOM updates asynchronously. Whenever a data change is observed (in our case, adding item into our array), it will NOT directly update the DOM, it will add all change into a queue (buffer).

                    <span>This library is great for displaying the &#x27;active&#x27; users of your React application. The responsiveness of react-avatar-group is meant to be similar to the Google Docs user icons. Some live examples are available here.
If you need a more in-depth tutorial on using this package with actual, live users, check out this post here. Otherwise, here&#x27;s a quick walk-through on how to use this package.

First, install the package:
npm install react-avatar-group

Then open up your React file and import the package, as follows:
// App.tsx
import AvatarGroup from &#x27;react-avatar-group&#x27;;

export default function App(){
  
}

The only required prop to the AvatarGroup component is avatars, which is an array of strings or IAvatar objects, for more customization.
Another important prop is max. This will hide the avatars beyond a certain length with a custom overflow avatar (as seen in the gif above). displayAllOnHover will show all minions passed when the mouse hovers the avatar group, if there is a max number passed.
All the props for react-avatar-group can be seen here.
Using these other props, your AvatarGroup may look like the following:
import AvatarGroup from &#x27;react-avatar-group&#x27;;

export default function App(){
  
}</span>

                    <span>¿Es posible crear una DAPP (Aplicación descentralizada) con Angular? La respuesta es sí, y es más fácil de lo que creerías. Pero antes necesitamos tener en claro algunos conceptos claves:
Es una aplicación que no depende de un sistema central, sino que depende de la comunidad de usuarios que la utilizan, una DAPP puede ser una app móvil o una aplicación web que interactúa con un contrato inteligente, el cual ejecuta todas las funciones.

Node &amp; NPM
Ganache
Metamask
Angular-Cli
Instalamos el CLI de Angular y Truffle para descargar la &quot;truffle box&quot;en la cual estará todo lo que necesitemos para nuestra DAPP.

I can&#x27;t really remember what I was googling when I saw an advert by flexiple .So I sign up and the company recruiter schedule a call with me the following week.
After this process, flexiple prepared my CV by trying to  organize it to suite potential client i would work with in the future. Which was pretty straight forward and fast.
The final stage was divided into two stages
So I had to start preparing for this interview with leetcode and Hacker Ranker. I  started practicing algorithm, learnt recursion, binary search, Hash tree etc. 
To prepare further someone shared a picture of some AlogExpert algorithms  questions and  how it helped him land is current  job .I took a screen shot and started solving this algorithms one after the other .Note  I didn&#x27;t solve all

To cut the long story short I did the code challenge and I am officially a freelance developer at flexiple looking forward to the journey ahead.</span>

                    <span>Yesterday, I was working on Hyperpanels&#x27; dashboard feature and my coworker @albertobeiz said the sentence every front-end developer fears: 

Can we generate a PDF from that?
Let&#x27;s see how I did it.
First, you&#x27;ll need some help, so run the following commands:
npm i --save dom-to-image
npm i --save jspdf

Once we have this two packages, we can use them in our code 
import { jsPDF } from &#x27;jspdf&#x27;;
import domtoimage from &#x27;dom-to-image&#x27;;

Add an ID to the HTML element you want to print:

    
 {
         const doc &#x3D; new jsPDF(dashboardWidth &gt; dashboardHeight ? &#x27;l&#x27; : &#x27;p&#x27;, &#x27;mm&#x27;, [dashboardWidth, dashboardHeight]);
         const imgProps &#x3D; doc.getImageProperties(imgData);
         const pdfWidth &#x3D; doc.internal.pageSize.getWidth();
         const pdfHeight &#x3D; (imgProps.height * pdfWidth) / imgProps.width;

         doc.addImage(imgData, &#x27;PNG&#x27;, 0, 0, pdfWidth, pdfHeight);
         doc.save(&#x27;Dashboard for hyperpanels.pdf&#x27;);
    });
}

This will create a PDF that will be saved from your browser:

And voilá, your HTML turned into a PDF:

                    <span>PrimeNG is a design-agnostic UI component library for Angular thanks to its flexible theming system. Today we’re excited to announce the new free Tailwind theme to join the already impressive lineup featuring Material, Bootstrap, FluentUI and PrimeOnes themes.
The new theme uses the official color palette from Tailwind and based on the design bits at Tailwind UI such as forms, modals and menus. If you are utilizing tailwind ui and looking for a fully featured UI component library, PrimeFaces with the Tailwind theme will be an excellent choice. Note that, the theme does not use tailwind classes and instead provides a look-alike style for a unified design when used together.

Image is a new addition to the UI suite to display an image with transformation options like rotate and zoom. For multiple images, please see the Galleria.

There are over 30 improvements in this release, defect fixes are mostly based on community feedback so thank you for helping us to make the library better.
PrimeNG is licensed under MIT and free to download at NPM.
Our current focus is on improving accessibility by creating a dedicated section per component for keyboard support and screen readers along with scores from audit tools.</span>

                    <span>Environment variables in an Angular app are extremely useful for storing constants in your app that need to be used frequently, such as API url&#x27;s, API access keys, Firebase config values and other general flags.
When a new Angular app is created via the CLI tooling using ng new, one of the folders generated is &#x27;environments&#x27;.
By default, this folder contains two files:
- environment.ts
- environment.prod.ts
These files come prepopulated with the following code:
environment.ts:
export const environment &#x3D; {
  production: false,
};

environment.prod.ts:
export const environment &#x3D; {
  production: true,
};

The simple explanation of the usage of these files is that any values added into an environment file are injected into the compiled files when the Angular app is built. 
The different files …</span>

                    <span>Linux sometimes seems to be very difficult from the outside but once you get a head start there are a ton of possibilities with linux which are not available with windows. Obviously you may not get as attractive and beginner friendly interface as windows does but everything comes with a price doesn&#x27;t it.
Here I will list 10 commands and explain them which you could try out yourself on your linux OS right away and experience it yourselves. 
df

this command will show the amount of available disk space and used disk space for file system to which you as a user currently has access to. For eg : if you have a dual boot system established in your pc and your linux OS doesn&#x27;t have access to the D folder.If you run this command on your linux terminal then you wont be able to see the partiton of used and unused space of D folder. this command is same as when you open the disk management tool in windows.



top

This command when you type in your terminal it will show the active linux processes which are managed by your linux kernel. This command is used like how you would use task manager in windows, the difference being , it shows the details of all the processes in far more depth than windows does.
it will look something like this when you type the command.


this is what is meant by each column head.

you can press &#x27;q&#x27; to exit this window in your termial.
