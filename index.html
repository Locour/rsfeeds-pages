                    <span>So, I&#x27;ve decided to release my source code on github for my Fireblog.io fully functional blog written in Angular, using Firestore as the database, and hosted on Cloud Run.
--- scroll down for screenshots, or Fireblog.io ---
I was originally hosted on Firebase Functions, but I wanted it to be a little bit faster, and the ng deploy to Firebase Functions also stopped working as expected. In fact, I wonder what the Angular Firebase Team is doing at all these days. The documentation for Angular Firebase 9 is still not up-to-date, and it seems like they are behind on updating to Angular 13 (to be fair, it has only been a few days at this point).
Before I get into anything, I have to recommend you check out Fireship.io, as it is the reason I have become proficient in these technologies.

                    <span>In Angular, we use HTTP to get data from backend,HTTP methods always return an observable.Generally we subscribe to that observable and assign response data to class variables to use it in our component.
But using RxJS operators we can compose multiple observables(data streams) or process  observable data  before subscribing to it.
RxJS concatMap operator
Observable emits observable).
concatMap operator
Takes each value from the outer observable and maps that value  to observable(called as inner observable) 
Concat all inner observables into a single observable in order  and subscribe to inner observables and emit data of each inner observable into output observable in sequential manner.
concatMap never subscribes to the next inner observable until the previous one completes.
Example:

Run live
Here we have 2 API’s
In the above case we need to take all roll numbers from the first API  and pass it to the second API.

So solution to this problem is use concatMap RxJS operator instead of nested subscription.

First contactMap operator -
getToppers_rollNum() this method returns an Observable of type number[] , conactMap  maps Observable to Observable (inner observable) then subscribes to inner observable and emit data into output observable(top_3_rollNum$).
Second  concatMap operator -
top_3_rollNum$ as outer observable.concatMap takes each roll number from the outer observable and hits http request sequentially(here we have 3 inner observables return by 3 http requests) &amp; emits http response data into output observable(topper_marks$).
concatMap never hits the next http request until the previous one completes.
Shorthand syntax for above code

So,concatMap is used where sequence of execution matters.

Nx Devtools recently released version 13.1, which came with a very handy generator for Angular libraries, which creates secondary entrypoints for your Angular Libraries with ease. In this blog post we will cover why and how we should make use of this new function.
By adding secondary entrypoints, we basically split our Angular libraries into multiple chunks, just like Angular Material does.
// One entrypoint: 
import { MatButtonModule, MatCardModule } from &#x27;@angular/material&#x27;;

// With secondary entrypoints:
import { MatButtonModule } from &#x27;@angular/material/button&#x27;;
import { MatCardModule } from &#x27;@angular/material/card&#x27;;

The idea behind it is not new at all, this option already exists since the beginning phase of ng-packagr. By leveraging seco…</span>

Apart from optimization and bugfixes, there are a few new features to discuss in the following parts.

Version 1.2.0 brings support for a second reverse proxy service in addition to JWilder Nginx / Let&#x27;s Encrypt Companion called Traefik. Traefik is a highly customizable edge router which brings a massive amount of built-in features: Reverse proxying, automatic service-detection, load balancing, no-downtime upgrades/configuring and supports Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, AWS, etc.

It really fascinated me to see how easy it is now to setup alerting and be notified about operational stuff. While I was learning more, I thought why not explore the same on AWS and thats when I bumped onto AWS Chatbot.
In this post I will go through the basics of this AWS managed service called ‘Chatbot’ and demonstrate how quickly you can setup an alerting mechanism to Slack, monitoring an AWS Glue ETL job.

                    <span>O Terraform trabalha com uma linguagem de configuração construida em blocos como os blocos provider, resource, variable entre outros.  
O objetivo principal da linguagem Terraform é declarar recursos , que representam objetos de infraestrutura. Todos os outros recursos de linguagem existem apenas para tornar a definição de recursos mais flexível e conveniente.
Os blocos são contêineres para outro conteúdo e geralmente representam a configuração de algum tipo de objeto, como um recurso. Os blocos têm um tipo de bloco, podem ter zero ou mais rótulos e ter um corpo que contém qualquer número de argumentos e blocos aninhados. A maioria dos recursos do Terraform é controlada por blocos de nível superior em um arquivo de configuração. Em outras palavras o Terraform trabalha com encapsulamento e instancias de objetos.
Beleza, nada melhor do que um Hello World para começar uma nova linguagem né?
No terraform o resultado de uma execução e tratado como uma saida da propria execução.
Para definir uma saída, você abre um bloco de saída usando a palavra chave output. Você então começa o bloco output com {. Você só tem permissão para definir uma única propriedade chamada value. Qualquer valor que você der à propriedade value será enviado ao console após um sucesso terraform apply. Você então fecha o bloco de saída com }.
output &quot;message&quot; {
    value &#x3D; &quot;Hello World&quot;
}

A saida será essa:

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization

It is the process of taking your website or piece of content to rank higher on search engines
The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to gather attention and attract prospective and existing customers to your business.
Search Engines like Google, uses bots to crawl websites and pages, and collects information and put them in index.

Modern Object Pascal uses the latest dialect of the Object Pascal programming language with a syntax similar to C# and Python 3.0, but that is easier to read, write, and learn.
Object Pascal supports high-level abstractions like polymorphism and generics while preserving the speed of compiled code without runtime overhead or performance penalties.
Java is a powerful programming language with broad coding possibilities but is challenging to handle, especially for beginners.
It is a class-based object-oriented programming language with many different versions across many years but is well suited for massive enterprise projects with thousands of developers.
Delphi and Object Pascal offer a simpler, more streamlined programming language that p…</span>

This article outlines the first step which is to establish a way for a DevOps to authenticate and access a Power Platform environment
DevOps uses Service Connections to authenticate against environments and you really have two types. You could create a Service Connection that just uses a standard user account or you could use a Service Principal.
With a user account, this will be treated like a normal user - so there may be license implications and is generally not the recommended method. With just a tiny bit of effort we can use Service Principals and therefore this is what I&#x27;ll be demonstrating with.

                    <span>Hey everyone 👋🏻,
In this article, let us learn about how we can render dynamic content to the client (which is not static). Let us first touch briefly on what a template engine is because rendering dynamic content is closely related to what a template engine will help us in achieving. 

A template engine is software designed to combine templates with a data model to produce multiple pages that share the same look throughout the site. These are the views in an MVC project.
So this helps us in putting dynamic content on our HTML pages. 
We got a HTML like template (technically not HTML) which is typically a file that contains a lot of HTML like content in it but with some placeholders plugged into it and then we have a server (a Node.js Express server or any other server) serving the Node/…</span>

                    <span>In this article, we will learn to create an API server using the Express framework and Typescript.
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way of interacting with a service, through a series of predefined requests.
Express is an open-source web framework, for Node.js, designed to make developing websites, web apps, and API&#x27;s easier.
TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types, it is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

                    <span>In this article, we are going to deep dive into Node.js architecture and understand the asynchronous nature of Node.js.
Let&#x27;s dive into it.
Node.js is a single-threaded, asynchronous, event-driven runtime environment for running Javascript code on the server.
By Single-threaded means Javascript runtime executes only one piece of code( or statement) at any instance of time synchronously. It has only one call stack and one heap memory. But then how does runtime handles multiple asynchronous operations in an efficient way ? Node.js handles it efficiently using its event-driven approach. Don&#x27;t worry about that now. We will come back to it soon :) .

                    <span>In Angular, we use HTTP to get data from backend,HTTP methods always return an observable.Generally we subscribe to that observable and assign response data to class variables to use it in our component.
But using RxJS operators we can compose multiple observables(data streams) or process  observable data  before subscribing to it.
RxJS concatMap operator
Observable emits observable).
concatMap operator
Takes each value from the outer observable and maps that value  to observable(called as inner observable) 
Concat all inner observables into a single observable in order  and subscribe to inner observables and emit data of each inner observable into output observable in sequential manner.
concatMap never subscribes to the next inner observable until the previous one completes.
Example:

Run live
Here we have 2 API’s
In the above case we need to take all roll numbers from the first API  and pass it to the second API.

So solution to this problem is use concatMap RxJS operator instead of nested subscription.

First contactMap operator -
getToppers_rollNum() this method returns an Observable of type number[] , conactMap  maps Observable to Observable (inner observable) then subscribes to inner observable and emit data into output observable(top_3_rollNum$).
Second  concatMap operator -
top_3_rollNum$ as outer observable.concatMap takes each roll number from the outer observable and hits http request sequentially(here we have 3 inner observables return by 3 http requests) &amp; emits http response data into output observable(topper_marks$).
concatMap never hits the next http request until the previous one completes.
Shorthand syntax for above code

So,concatMap is used where sequence of execution matters.

                    <span>Originally posted here!
To convert an entire object to a read-only or a constant object, you can use the as keyword after the object initialization followed by the keyword const in TypeScript.
// using &quot;as&quot; keyword after the person
// object initialisation followed by the keyword &quot;const&quot;
// to make the object readonly or a constant object
const person &#x3D; {
  name: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
  age: 23,
} as const;

// change the &quot;name&quot; property value
person.name &#x3D; &quot;Hello&quot;; // ❌ not allowed. Cannot assign to &#x27;name&#x27; because it is a read-only property.

For example, let&#x27; say we have an object called person with 2 properties called name and age having values of John Doe and 23 respectively like this,
// a simple object
const person &#x3D; {
  name: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
  age: 23,
};

                    <span>I use NestJS at my day job. It’s a complicated framework sometimes and there are lots of things that devs “just have to remember” or there will be bugs in your application that you won’t see until runtime.
I wanted to remove this cognative load from NestJS engineers so that they can focus on valuable work instead. I wrote an ESLint plugin to alert developers directly in their IDE or editor when these common issues exist - (Available on NPM) https://www.npmjs.com/package/@darraghor/eslint-plugin-nestjs-typed
Here is what I learned about writing ESLint plugins in typescript for typescript while building the plugin.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a disorganized person by nature. When I follow a process it&#x27;s by habit and intuition. But when a debugging problem keeps me up at night and gets me to that state of mind where a career of raising sheep in New Zealand seems like an attractive option... That&#x27;s when I need to back off and walk through this process in an orderly fashion. This process never fails. When you walk through it, you can track any problem.
Now I&#x27;m going to skip a lot of common advice. Most debugging tutorials start with things that relate to a process: File an issue, reproduce as a test case etc. I think there&#x27;s plenty written on that online. People use it as filler since they assume debugging is a simple process. It is sometimes. But as we will learn in this blog, there&#x27;s a lot of depth and breadth to this mislea…</span>

But behind our technology is a team of engineers. Until recently, those engineers were focused exclusively on building the best product possible for consumers and individuals. When I was brought on board to lead new initiatives as the Head of Engineering for Grammarly Business and Grammarly for Developers, we knew Grammarly was about to undergo full-on hypergrowth.  
Then the pandemic changed everything. Suddenly, in the midst of hiring and onboarding, we found ourselves transitioning to a remote-first organization. 
Hypergrowth is hard. It’s even harder when a company that values in-person interactions tries to go remote in the middle of a pandemic. 
To be successful, we needed to spearhead two initiatives. The …</span>

                    <span>Recently a junior developer sent me an obfuscated stack trace and was pretty surprised when I instantly knew the problem and pointed him at the necessary change. To be fair, I had the advantage of being the person who put that bug there in the first place... But still the ability to glean information from a stack trace, even an obfuscated one, is a serious skill.
The stack trace in question was a ClassNotFoundException, that&#x27;s typically pretty easy and already tells you everything you need to know. The class isn&#x27;t there.Why it isn&#x27;t there is really a matter of what we did wrong. In this case since the project was obfuscated the bug was that this class wasn&#x27;t excluded from obfuscation.

We all might have used the curl command but might be unaware of it. It&#x27;s super old
Curl or cURL command is the utility or tool to access the internet from the command
Before we talk about how to use the curl command let&#x27;s talk about why might we need
curl or Client URL is a command-line utility that helps in accessing/posting
 It basically serves as a

The above is a basic structure of the curl command. We see the argument
curl &quot;https://github.com&quot;   

From this query to github.com, you are literally going to GitHub.com and getting a response as the entire HTML source code of the page.
curl &quot;https://github.com&quot; &gt;temp.html

With this command, we store the output of the command in the file temp.html, it can be any other file you like.

If I could build an app of any kind, the first thing that comes to mind pertains to wait times for ordering food. Just like Disney has wait times for rides, food service places should have wait times for lines to order food. Especially in a college town, time is money, so to limit the amount of time waiting would be priceless. Some could argue order ahead, but that is not always the case or an option for certain establishments.
This application would be used for the time efficient human being, college student, or working class. It really would be used by anyone universally. If you believe time is money, this application is for you.

The restaurant, during business hours, will show up on the application with the wait time if you were to get online and order at …</span>

Focus on quality:
No one wants to watch a lame video. Make sure you make a video that you and your friends would want to watch before you spend the effort and money to promote it. The better the video, the easier it will be to see. Of course it will be hard to do without investment if you want to see guaranteed results. Take note, it&#x27;s easier to buy at https://lowcostsmm.com where views are 100, 1000 or more for your YouTube channel.

                    <span>Flow state is a rare treat for me these days. The last time I can remember being in that zone was working on a GraphiQL implementation for Open Sauced, https://explore.opensauced.pizza. The Open Sauced project makes use of OneGraph, to handle authentication and persisted query features in working with the GitHub GraphQL API. This was the first I had worked on any kind of GraphiQL implementation, so for those of you at the point I was at then, GraphiQL is an Open Source project that can be used to interact with a GraphQL API in an ad-hoc and dynamic way, allowing a developer to iterate quickly on features from a data retrieval standpoint. This post is about the PR #2 in the repo.

In case you are reading for the first time, I am Habdul Hazeez, and the author of this weekly series of articles where we review some security news that is worthy of your time. This has been the case for over a year now.
Do you like what I do? You can buy me a Coffee.
Moving on.
This week&#x27;s review is about malware, vulnerabilities, hacking, and social engineering. The latter resulted in someone losing half a million dollars.

                    <span>Very recently, AWS announced Vault Lock for AWS backup. This new feature enables the protection of backups from accidental or malicious actions.  Behind the scenes, this extra safeguard is made possible by storing backups using a Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) model. 
The main reason to rehash this? Unique features like this seem to stay under the radar way too often. Secondly, if you already use AWS Backup, then enabling this extra protection is almost effortless.
Here&#x27;s an example of AWS Backup Vault using Locks in CloudFormation:

                    <span>The number of phishing attempts sent by SMS grew by 328% in 2020. Here’s how Smishing works and how you can protect yourself.



  
  
  
You know all about phishing. From time to time, emails purporting to be from Facebook or your bank drift into your inbox and insist you “verify your account.” Look closer and you spot the telltale signs of a scam: a sketchy-looking sender address, sloppy writing, and a complete lack of personalization. You sigh and hit delete.
It’s easy to be cynical about opportunistic, mass-mailed phishing attempts. Although some look genuine to even the most cautious eye, others feel decidedly amateurish and are readily identifiable. Billions of emails are sent each month, with over 245,000 phishing-related websites created in January alone according to the Anti-Phish…</span>

                    <span>PropelAuth is a hosted, configurable authentication service. Below are five reasons why you should consider it for your product.
Once you sign up for PropelAuth, you immediately have your own authentication service. This includes a lot behind the scenes, but to your end-users, the first thing they will see is this

You can brand your site easily by supplying your product&#x27;s colors and a logo. This branding applies not only to all your auth pages, but also to any emails that we send (forgotten passwords, email confirmations, user invites, etc.).

Also, this branding includes the URL your customers are on. We support custom domains so your users see your auth pages on https://auth.yourdomain.com, not https://yourname.propelauth.com.

                    <span>A mock of localStorage written in TypeScript


The other day, I started writing mock of localStorage in TypeScript.
Regarding this code, please note that it does not behave completely the same as localStorage.
The behavior is not perfectly reproduced (The value returned when an unintended value is passed, for example), but the basic logic is implemented.
type Store &#x3D; any;

class LocalStorageMock {
  store: Store;
  length: number;

  constructor() {
    this.store &#x3D; {};
    this.length &#x3D; 0;
  }

  key(n: number): any {
    if (typeof n &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;undefined&#x27;) {
      throw new Error(

                    <span>One of the simplest ways to have a rough idea of how long a piece of code is taking to execute is by using the console methods time, timerLog, and timeEnd. 
Example:
console.time(&quot;answer time&quot;);
// where &#x60;answer time&#x60; is a label to identify this timer
alert(&quot;Click to continue&quot;);
console.timeLog(&quot;answer time&quot;);
alert(&quot;Do a bunch of other stuff...&quot;);
console.timeEnd(&quot;answer time&quot;);

Most of the time you just want to time a whole event and don&#x27;t care about intermediate steps, though. Then, you just need console.time, console.timeEnd. 
That&#x27;s pretty much it.</span>

One of the new features we&#x27;ve introduced is a directive for directly accessing the current route data property from within the component&#x27;s template.

                    <span>Most software projects start out in English since the majority of terms in software development are in English. The problem is that it is unlikely that every user will be comfortable with your app when it isn’t in a language that they use on a daily basis. This is where internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10) comes in.
The act of localizing an app is a common problem because of the dynamic nature, which stops tools like Google Translate from working. Therefore a large wealth of internationalization tools exists solves the problem in various ways, but in this tutorial I am going to showcase inlang which is a way to ensure type safety in your translations so you never miss a translation again.

                    <span>In this article we are going to talk about the differences between Javascript and Typescript, they are two languages that are widely use nowadays in all types of projects, JS was the first to be introduced as client-side language. As time passed the projects were JS was being used started to be too complex and heavy, thats were TS enters the game, and starts as language to resolve all the problems that JS was having at the moment, nowadays TS is a language widely used also and is becoming bigger and bigger, so I hope that with this article I can help you a little bit to now any differences or to resolve any doubts.

There are many differences, now I&#x27;m going to show you a comprehensible list of differences.
JS is used for client-side mostly while TS is used mostly for both client-side and server-side.
TS has an improved readability, since JS requires a lot of manual detection of bugs and errors, this has been improved a lot by TS.
TS has static typing while JS doesn&#x27;t support it since JS is a dynamically-typed language.
TS supports ES6.
TS has a full support in modern IDE.
TS can also convert its code to JS if necessary.
Using TS means that you can use OOP(Object-oriented programming) principles.
In JS functions are considered an object and they can have its own method and properties.
The choice is up to you at the end on what to choose if you want to work with this languages, you will have to balance the pros and the cons between both of them, and make an educated choice. Usually the option you choose will come from different variables like having in mind the size and complexity of the project you are going to work on, there are more differences between this two languages but the ones I wrote are the main ones and the important ones, I hope you like the article, any queries feel free to comment and ask!</span>

                    <span>I wrote an article on why to use Typescript if you&#x27;re still in doubt about whether to use it in your projects. In short, Typescript allows you to write maintainable code. Javascript works well for prototyping but becomes frustrating when you return to a project again. Suddenly, you see blocks of code where you can&#x27;t understand what kind of data passes there.
In this article, I want to introduce you to Typescript while playing with code. Thus, you see it in action and don&#x27;t overflow with an unnecessary theory. I recommend playing with the code you&#x27;ll meet here in Typescript Playground.

We will implement a simple ToDo app with backend and client app. Let&#x27;s start.
First we will define the project with basic informations.

backend server[
        owners(duskovesin)
        template springboot(tests fabut)        
    ]

We are starting with the definition of User and Todo #models, with a few fields and Todo Status #enums.

            ADMIN

Joe Doss is leading us on this adventure into Linux.

The adventure starts by working through the Gentoo Handbook and installing Gentoo(a distribution of Linux) on Lenovo ThinkPads.

During our meetings, I have been taking notes. These notes are useful for people in our club. 
One of the first things we did when we got our laptops was set up our BIOS. 
This post will give a brief description of what BIOS is, how to navigate to it, and some of the common settings you might change. 
BIOS or Basic Input/Output System is a small piece of code that lives in a “read only” chip on your system board(motherboard). 
Note:  read-only means that a file can be opened or read but can&#x27;t be deleted or renamed.

                    <span>Introduction


Linux is one of the most popular operating systems in the world. It is Unix-like, and it is also open-source. Quite a big percentage of developers use Linux because it can be customized in so many ways.
What&#x27;s cool about Linux is its command line. Every &#x27;hackers&#x27; paradise. There are a ton of commands. If you aren&#x27;t familiar with any Linux commands, be sure to check out this post on the 8 Linux Commands Everyone Should Know.
There is probably a command for almost anything that you want to do. For example what if you wanted to get the size of a directory? Well luckily for you there is a command for that. In this post, we are going to talk about that command and see what it can offer.

                    <span>💡 What is the best way to apply Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to your ASP.NET Web API? Let&#x27;s find out together.



  
  
  
Role-Based Access Control, also known as RBAC, is one of the most common strategies to restrict access to protected resources within an organization. It simplifies permission assignment by categorizing users in roles. However, many people making their first foray into RBAC have questions:
How can you reflect this user categorization on your application to check users&#x27; privileges?
How can you deal with roles in your code?
Is role control appropriate for Web APIs?
In this article, you will learn the best way to implement RBAC in your ASP.NET Core Web API by using Auth0&#x27;s capabilities.

                    <span>Okta (Auth0) was placed into the Leader Quadrant for 2021, parent company Okta also named a Leader.



  
  
  
We are proud to announce that Auth0, a product unit within Okta, has been recognized as a Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management, Worldwide. Gartner defines the Access Management market as: &quot;The access management (AM) market is defined by customers’ needs to establish, enforce, and manage run-time access controls for internal and external types of identities, as well as machine identities, interacting with cloud, modern standards-based web and legacy web applications&quot; Auth0 focuses on SaaS-delivered developer-centric and Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) use cases.
For more information, please download the full 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management report.

The Magic Quadrant recognized Okta (Auth0) as a Leader based on our Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision.  
Auth0 believes that CIAM should do more to balance the three forces of security, privacy and convenience — not just keeping the bad actors out, but also driving customer loyalty and conversion and revenue to create a great experience for our customers, partners, and their end-users.
We believe vendors&#x27; experience in the space is a key consideration for Gartner in their Magic Quadrant Evaluations. As stated by one of our customers in their review of Auth0, included in the 2021 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer Access Management Report, Auth0 comes with great features out-of-the-box. We went live easily with Auth0 as our Identity Provider. The platform/vendor does not just support us in a technical angle, but also understanding our user journey and sharing their experience (with other clients) and what approaches to take to minimize risk and even enhance user experience during the migration. — VP, Core Product Development, Retail industry

💛 Huge thanks to Teppei Fukuda for reviewing this tutorial.
You’ve adopted continuous integration (CI), followed TDD and BDD principles — having mastered testing, you deploy anytime, at a moment’s notice. You are a CI guru. You can live happily ever after.
Like all fairy tales, the story ends abruptly; before real life intrudes. Before we realize that a vital component has been left out, security.
In this tutorial, I’ll propose ways of integrating security at every stage of your CI/CD workflow. I can’t promise a happy life, but I guarantee you’ll sleep better at night.

                    <span>Why Random Numbers Are Not Random?


The Random Numbers come from a particular seed number which is usually the system clock.Run the program below to understand the security risk.




The Python Documentation also has a warning about the same: &quot;The pseudo-random generators of this module should not be used for security purposes.&quot;
So all the password generators you have built using random module are not secure!? So How do we generate cryptographically secure numbers/passwords?
But there is another line after that warning:
For security or cryptographic uses, see the secrets module.&quot;
The secrets module is used for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets.

  What is Node JS?


Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js is a popular, lightweight web framework for beginners, and it is used by many big companies like Netflix and Uber.


  
  
  What is NPM?


NPM is the default package manager for Node.js projects. NPM includes a command-line tool (CLI) that give you access to the NPM package registry. The registry stores the numerous JavaScript packages made available through the NPM CLI, along with their…</span>

First, we must install python3 and pip, together with some other dependencies:
$ sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
$ pip3 install distro jsonschema PyYAML

Then install kas; I had a problem with a dependency so I had to install another package by hand
$ pip3 install testresources
$ pip3 install kas

As an example, we can try to build a simple image for the qemu machine which is already contained in the poky
kas-project.yml, which will describe how our distribution must be built
$ mkdir kas-pine64
$ touch kas-project.yml

Add the following snippet to the project configuration file:

                    <span>A VPN can be a lot of things. You might think you know what a VPN is…but do you really? A virtual private network just sends private traffic over a public network. But where is that traffic going, and for what purpose? After all, networks come in all shapes and sizes.
In this two-part tutorial, we will discuss four “types” of VPN’s, which could just be considered use cases, and set them up with WireGuard® and Netmaker, a free networking platform, in under 10 minutes:
Personal (Private Browsing)


Remote Access


Site-to-Site


Mesh (virtual LAN/WAN)



WireGuard® is a new and very fast VPN technology. Usually, VPN’s make your internet slower. With WireGuard®, the difference is negligible. Netmaker uses WireGuard® under the hood, and can simplify setting up environments from homelab to ente…</span>

For the shortcut to be created follow the steps below.

                    <span>In this simple tutorial, I will be explaining how to configure your windows subsystem for Linux efficiently and optimize your WSL performance when you&#x27;re running applications through them.
 Everyone has widespread access to windows but they may or maynot be savvy enough to run their favorite flavour of linux due to various constraints
WSL2 really makes life easy for those devs who can&#x27;t access linux through a cloud provider or locally run it on their devices.
WSL has support for various distros like Debian, Arch and Ubuntu.
Now coming to the interesting part, windows has all access to the CPU and memory resources in your device and it is built in a way which will optimize the resource utilization but how do you limit your linux subsystem, let  us say you&#x27;d like to manipulate the configuration to suit your needs the best, then you should follow these steps.
Shut your current running instance of WSL using this command
wsl --shutdown

Run this command through powershell as administrator
Create a configuration file for WSL on your user profile directory
notepad &quot;$env:USERPROFILE\.wslconfig&quot;

 This is the most important step in this project, so please follow carefully 
The following parameters define their corresponding resources:
CPU  &#x3D; &gt; cores dedicated to WSL
Memory  &#x3D; &gt; RAM allocated to WSL
AutoMount  &#x3D; &gt; Mount your default NTFS drive to your subsystem
Boot &#x3D;&gt; defines your booting options for services
Kernel  &#x3D; &gt; Custom kernel for linux
LocalhostForwarding  &#x3D; &gt; for port-forwarding your applications running on localhost
My configuration for CPU and memory:
[wsl2]
memory&#x3D;9GB  
processors&#x3D;4

This is how you can configure your resources for WSL 😀. Feel free to leave some comments down below⬇️.
