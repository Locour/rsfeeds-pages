                    <span>For SSR and node.js usage of Angular, we may need to have a Promise complete before the page is loaded. This is especially true when we need to create meta tags for SEO. Yes, our app is slower, but we have to get it indexable.
Every wonder why your meta tags seem to work sometimes, but not other times? It is because ngOnInit is NOT an async function, even with async, neither is a constructor which must return this, and neither is an async pipe in your template. Sometimes the fetches return on time, other times they don&#x27;t. So, I added this post:
ngOnInit does NOT wait for the promise to complete. You can make it an async function if you feel like using await like so:
import { take } from &#x27;rxjs/operators&#x27;;

async ngOnInit(): Promise {

                    <span>Salve devs, hoje eu venho falar da minha experi√™ncia em ter participado do meu primeiro hackathon feito pelo Grupo FCamara como parte do programa de forma√ß√£o deles.
Foi uma oportunidade muito boa para mim j√° que ainda n√£o tenho contato com o mercado de trabalho de tecnologia e estou em transi√ß√£o de carreira, e com certeza me ajudou a entender como o trabalho de um programador √©, tendo uma equipe de devs, designers e metodologias √°geis como SCRUM.
Assim eu lhes apresento nosso projeto, o Orange Space!!!

                    <span>This article assumes you have knowledge about building React Components, Libraries, and Tailwind.
If you ever want to do a React component library with typescript and have a nice setup for your blanket project I will recommend Create React Library for sure! Alongside visually test your components using Storybook, this CLI allows you, out of the box,  to test your component in a real React project. Take a look at it for your next React Library Project.
Well this part is up to you, I usually pick styled system w/ styled components but to be honest then you have to write a lot a CSS (not too much tho), and if you need to move faster get around with extra files to manage could be an issue.
Even when that approach is ok why not use utility classes? This is where Tailwind came to the rescue!

In our previous article, we looked at how to get started using GitHub webhooks.
However, what are the actual real-world applications of GitHub webhooks? In what ways can this technology deliver value to our applications? These are the questions we will be trying to provide answers to in this article by taking a look at some of the most common real-world applications of GitHub webhooks.
Before we dive into the various use cases of GitHub webhooks, let&#x27;s discuss why GitHub webhooks are a useful piece of technology. For over a decade now, GitHub has served as a central hub for storing, sharing, and collaborating on code-based projects.
It can be argued that GitHub houses the code for most of the software applications, frameworks, plugins, and any code-based technology that we u‚Ä¶</span>

Voice AI and site reliability engineering? What a ridiculous match up. The two live in completely different worlds. The former in the world of pesky call centers, the latter in the world of ponytailed sys admins. 
I could end my post here if not for one thing. I signed up to give a lecture on using voice AI for site reliability engineering at conf42. Why would I do a stupid thing like that? Because I had a vision of how the two can work together.
In this tutorial we will use the following technologies and tools:

HTTPS requests 
Site reliability monitoring (we will use Better Uptime)
Conversational voice AI (we will use Dasha)

                    <span>While installing some packages on my Raspberry Pi, I encountered an outage with one of the package mirrors in Canada.
It&#x27;s a problem I haven&#x27;t faced before, so I figured I&#x27;d share how to get around it.
When running the following command:
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install -y git

I got the following error:
Err:1 http://mirrors.switch.ca/raspbian/raspbian buster/main armhf liberror-perl
  404  Not Found [IP: 209.115.181.106 80]
E: Failed to fetch http://mirrors.switch.ca/raspbian/raspbian/pool/main/libe/liberror-perl/liberror-perl_0.17027-2_all.deb  404  Not Found [IP: 209.115.181.106 80]
E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?

After some poking around on the server, it turns out that none of the files in the liberror-perl directory existed. I sent the team that manages the mirror an email and noticed that they had just completed a server migration.
In the meantime, I&#x27;m going to point myself to a different mirror so I can get things installed and working.
First, head to the RaspbianMirrors Website, which lists all mirrors by geographic location.
Pick something close to you that&#x27;s not the one that&#x27;s inoperable. I chose the Free Mirror project since it&#x27;s also in Canada.
(http|https)://raspbian.freemirror.org/raspbian/

Grab the URL, and head over to your /etc/apt/sources.list on your Raspberry Pi.
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

Place the following line at the top of the file, making sure to adjust the URL to the one you grabbed from the Mirrors website.
deb https://raspbian.freemirror.org/raspbian/ buster main contrib non-free rpi

Save the file, and run your update and install commands again.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git

Success! The Pi will now install things from the new mirror while the old one gets sorted out. Happy hacking!</span>

There&#x27;s a lot more to machine learning. Implementation of an ML algorithm is just the tip of the iceberg. Machine learning systems are a part of a much larger ecosystem. Creating a well-performing machine learning model is just a small aspect of real-world machine learning solutions.

                    <span>As an SRE, your main job is to think about the infrastructure from a software developer&#x27;s eyes. Because of that, one of the things you should be constantly thinking about is how can the application perform better from a software and infrastructure perspective, and how can I get that information?
The answer is with application monitoring.
When you&#x27;re monitoring an application, you start to understand its bottlenecks. When you understand its bottlenecks, you begin to understand how to fix them from a development perspective.
In this blog post, you&#x27;ll learn about what performance means and how to monitor your applications.
When you&#x27;re thinking about performance, it&#x27;s not just about the uptime or how long the servers have been running. It&#x27;s about how the application is accepting interactions. ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>In the design world, dark mode is the new black. Also known as the light-on-dark-color scheme, night mode, or black mode, dark mode displays everything on a dark background with light text and icons. 
Dark mode isn‚Äôt a new concept, but it‚Äôs gained a lot of popularity in recent years ‚Äî so much so that most operating systems, browsers, smartphones, and apps now support dark mode.
Dark mode became famous in 2018 when Sylvian Boyer extended dark mode to smartphones with OLED screens. Developers, gamers, and hackers quickly adopted the dark theme, and they remain the most significant users. 
According to a 2020 survey, 70 percent of developers prefer dark mode IDE while coding or programming.
Still, dark mode has gained popularity even with general device users. Now, most operating systems, bro‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>You&#x27;re writing some integration tests and as part of doing so you need to check on some Azure Resources - perhaps look in a database, check service bus messages - you need access to some Azure infrastructure to assert that the expected things have happened. When running from Azure Devops, you can take advantage of a form of Managed Identity and avoid any connection strings in your test code
If you&#x27;re writing Devops Pipelines, you can setup Service Connections in your project which give you access to Azure subscriptions. A service connection to Azure from Devops is associated with a Service Principal Name (SPN). 
Once you have a connection and SPN, your YAML pipelines can use this to authenticate with Azure when running certain tasks. A sneaky way of achieving identity management is possibl‚Ä¶</span>

Hello, everyone! 
workflow, job, step, command, and other basic terms.
First, we‚Äôll talk about the structure of your config file (AKA the CircleCI YAML). It should look something like this:

Config - This part will specify the version of your CircleCI config. Any Orbs, and their versions (I‚Äôll talk about orbs later), and any parameters you wish to define ‚ÄúCI wide‚Äù
Workflow - The main component of every Circle config, this is our entry point where we define workflows (there can be multiple; nightly, tests, etc). Each workflow is composed of multiple jobs.
Jobs - A series of steps/commands that will be executed on a specified machine. You can write out your own steps, or use predefined commands.
Commands - Those are steps that you have previously defined and will reference in your jo‚Ä¶</span>

They discuss regional salaries and the belief in paying people for the work they perform, not paying them based on where they live, how there are more opportunities to work in Developer Relations now more than ever, that half of working in DevRel is convincing people that DevRel should even exist, and soon every company will soon need a Chief Developer Relations Officer (CDRO)!

Part 0 briefly explained the clone syscall. It&#x27;s like fork/vfork, but with more options to control the child process. Actually, some implementations of fork propagate the call to clone().
Besides controlling which parts of the execution context get shared from the parent process, the clone call offers the possibility for us to create a separate memory block for the child&#x27;s stack. The nix implementation of clone has the following signature:
pub fn clone(
 cb: CloneCb,

It is more likely than not that Docker and containers are going to be part of your IT career in one way or another.
In this blog post series I&#x27;ll cover the following:
  What are Docker images, containers and Docker Hub
  Installing Docker on Ubuntu Linux on a DigitalOcean Droplet
  Working with Docker containers
  Working with Docker images
  Deploying a Dockerized app
I&#x27;ll be using DigitalOcean for all of the demos, so I would strongly encourage you to create a DigitalOcean account follow along. You would learn more by doing!

The goal of this library is to use native async functions (if ES7 is available) and/or native Promise (ES6) including Promise.race() and Promise.all() to implement the concurrency behavior (look our source code).
asyncPool runs multiple promise-returning &amp; async functions in a limited concurrency pool. It rejects immediately as soon as one of the promises rejects. It resolves when all the promises completes. It calls the iterator function as soon as possible (under concurrency limit). For example:
const timeout &#x3D; i &#x3D;&gt; new Promise(resolve &#x3D;&gt; setTimeout(() &#x3D;&gt; resolve(i), i));

                    <span>React Tutorial


This is the React comment box example from the React tutorial.
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

Pretty exciting, right?

This is a written tutorial for the Notion API with NextJS. Linktree Clone youtube series
By the end, you will learn how to consume data out of a notion page and use it anyway, for this tutorial we will be using next js.
The first thing we need is a notion page, which will be used as the data source.
this template
!! While replacing or adding the image block(first block), make sure to use the &#x27;embed&#x27; image option, instead of upload, as Notion provides access for only 60min for uploaded images, so it&#x27;s better to use an external one, more on this later.
In order for you to interact with this page using the Notion api, you need to have an Integration, which has access to this specific page.
1) Goto notion app
If you duplicated the template, you&#x27;re good t‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>‚ú® What is uvu?


In this post we will look at using uvu for TypeScript API testing.  uvu is a lightweight and lightning fast test runner.  It is bare-boned though has enough functionality to run unit and integration tests on your app&#x27;s backend.  Being so fast you can merge it into your continuous integration process.  This means you can run tests before every push to your git repo.  On top it works well with test driven development, where you write tests first to define expected behaviour and then implement your feature.
We won&#x27;t build an app as we normally do in these posts.  I have created a basic GraphQL API coded in TypeScript and using Fastify and Apollo server though. So you can clone that from the git repo to follow along or check out details we don&#x27;t have time to go into here.  Alt‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>ü•ä Who wins when we have tasks waiting to be implemented in Job queue as well as in Callback queue.


Hmmmm.... let&#x27;s see who wins with the piece of code below. üîà
// setTimeout is a web API which waits for the time as given // in 2nd parameter and then moves the callback function in 
// call back queue   
setTimeout(() &#x3D;&gt; console.log(&#x27;1&#x27;), 0);
setTimeout(() &#x3D;&gt; console.log(&#x27;2&#x27;), 10);

// Promise is a class in JavaScript so the functionality is 
// native, to handle the functions executed we have a Job 
// queue
Promise.resolve(&#x27;hi&#x27;).then((data) &#x3D;&gt; console.log(&#x27;3&#x27;))

console.log(&#x27;4&#x27;);


If you execute this code the logs will be
4
3
1
2

This proves that JobQ has priority over callback queue if call stack is empty, Of course!.

                    <span>While .env files are a common method for defining configs and secrets, it gives rise to security risks and the issue of manual management of .env files across different environments can be an uphill task. In this article, we will introduce a better way of managing and securing secrets using Doppler.
In this article, we will be using a music application linked to Firebase as a case study. The app makes use of its credentials to access and use Firebase services. We will cover how to set up a Doppler project and migrate our Firebase app credentials from the .env file to Doppler.
Secret management refers to the methods and tools used to organize, manage and secure digital authentication credentials. These credentials could be API keys, SSH keys or even encryption keys used to authorize users t‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>From the basic to advanced concepts of AWS own service for identity and access management: users, groups, permissions for resources and much more.
For seriously working with AWS, there&#x27;s no way around its Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. Skipping to understand its core principles will bite you again and again in the futureÔ∏è.
Take the time to do a deep dive, so you won&#x27;t be frustrated later.
Overview of the topics to cover:
  IAMs Capabilities
  Key Terms
  Identity- &amp; Resource-based Policies
  Securing your AWS Account
  Basics: Credentials &amp; AWS CLI
  Dealing with &quot;Access Denied&quot;
  Least Privilege
  Permission Boundaries
  Tooling
Personally, IAM is the most outstanding AWS core service, with an endless list of features that are well-integrated into the whole service landscap‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>What&#x27;s a Subject Luca? And why today do you want to speak about subjects? Is there a mistake in the publishing? Or are you simply drunk?

No guys, don&#x27;t worry, It&#x27;s the topic of the day :)
A Subject is like an Observable, but can multicast to many Observers. Subjects are like EventEmitters: they maintain a registry of many listeners.

Every Subject is an Observable
Given a Subject, you can subscribe to it, providing an Observer, which will start receiving values normally. From the perspective of the Observer, it cannot tell whether the Observable execution is coming from a plain unicast Observable or a Subject.
Every Subject is an Observer
It is an object with the methods next(v), error(e), and complete(). To feed a new value to the Subject, just call next(theValue), and it will be multica‚Ä¶</span>

  Introduction


In this series of articles, we are going to learn how to create generic models and services step-by-step regarding the CRUD feature of resources in Angular.
In a nutshell, we&#x27;re going to learn:
How to use generics in Typescript
What is CRUD operations in APIs
How to create generic models in Angular
How to create generic service for CRUD in Angular
One of the most important principles in programming is the &quot;Don&#x27;t-Repeat-Yourself&quot; (DRY) principle wh‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>We all agreed about not manipulating data inside component or better to say presentation layer.
So I decided to put logout logic inside guard, this way I will be able to just call logout route and done!
For this I&#x27;ve configured my authentication module routes like this:
{
    path: &#x27;login&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false }
  },
  {
    path: &#x27;register&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: true }
  },
  {
    path: &#x27;logout&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false },
    canActivate: [LogoutGuard]
  }

I love to keep things as simple and low as possible üòÅ
For log out I&#x27;ve added canActivate field and passed the LogoutGuard, the guards have the ability to return UrlTree. It is awesome, let&#x27;s see how the guard implemented:
@Injectable()
export class LogoutGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {
  }

  canActivate(): UrlTree {
    this.store.dispatch(logout());
    return this.router.createUrlTree([&#x27;auth&#x27;, &#x27;login&#x27;]);
  }
}

That&#x27;s it!
The canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!
After this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.

                    <span>Introduction


Preloading is great. It lets us fetch parts of our application before it is even requested for. By doing this, our content is ready to be served when needed without any delay. There are many ways of doing this, I&#x27;ll be touching upon some of the ways to do this in Angular and how we can create our own custom preloading strategy based on the user&#x27;s network state.
Angular provides us with route-based preloading out of the box. There are two strategies namely PreloadAllModules and NoPreloading.
NoPreloading, as the name suggests does not preload any modules. This is the default behaviour.
PreloadAllModules, on the other hand, preloads all modules. A simple example adding a preloading strategy in a routing module file can be seen below
app.routing.module.ts

                    <span>When we use external libraries, it is very common to declare a global object and use it.  But the price to pay is get complex testing scenario, and of course global object like magic is not a ‚Äúgood practice‚Äù.
How I can tell to angular about provide an external library declared as global?
My example was using the leaflet library, using the InjectionToken class and @Inject.
If you want to read more about it. 
‚Äî https://angular.io/api/core/InjectionToken
https://angular.io/api/core/inject#usage-notes
Install the leaflet package and register into the angular.json to load the library.
npm install leaflet

Open the angular.json file and add leaflet.css and leaflet.js assets.

                    <span>Different rendering methods can alter how much of the rendering falls on to clients, the search engine‚Äôs bot requesting the page, or the user‚Äôs browser. Two of the most popular rendering methods are isomorphic rendering and dynamic rendering. 
Isomorphic rendering makes use of Universal JavaScript, as it renders on both client-side or server-side. Dynamic rendering, on the other hand, is often considered to be a workaround for social media crawlers or search engines that are not running on JavaScript. This rendering method is recommended by search engines like Google or Bing. 
Both these rendering methods have their specific advantages, so choosing between them can be a bit difficult. This guide will help you make decisions on how to render your website by discussing these rendering method‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>I have always wanted to access private servers (accessed only through VPN or SSH tunnels) through domains without going through the hassle of locally modifying hosts files in the client side (me and my colleagues) or the SSH config files, so here&#x27;s my attempt to solve this problem.
I used a t3a.nano AWS EC2 instance to demonstrate the idea with Ubuntu 20.04 on it, with OpenVPN as my VPN server and dnsmasq as a DNS server.
I used dnsmasq instead of something like BIND because it&#x27;s much easier to setup and maintain. 
This was made only for demonstration purpose, so to quickly setting up an OpenVPN server without pain I used angristan/openvpn-install script to do so.

                    <span>Transferring files to servers is a vital task in most software developers&#x27; life. Usually, we use protocols like FTP (File Transfer Protocol), FTPS, SFTP to transfer files. In this tutorial, we are going to briefly discuss the available protocols and their differences. Also, the tutorial will explain how to transfer files from client to server, server to client and server to server using SCP.
FTP is an old and insecure protocol that can be used to transfer files between local networks or computers connected through the Internet. However, FTP is not recommended to use to transfer files over the Internet anymore as it transfers usernames and passwords in cleartext. In addition to that, FTP provides an anonymous method that let you transfer files even without a username and password.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve slowly adding more and more lua functions into my neovim configuration,





  
  
  Telegraph.nvim


Check out the project readme
I want a simple way to make remaps into shell commands that can open new tmux
For example I want to make remaps to do things like open the current file in lookatme.
# vim :terminal
nnoremap s Telegraph pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark

# tmux session
nnoremap s lua require&#x27;telegraph&#x27;.telegraph({cmd&#x3D;&#x27;pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark&#x27;, how&#x3D;&#x27;tmux&#x27;})

# tmux popup
nnoremap S lua require&#x27;telegraph&#x27;.telegraph({cmd&#x3D;&#x27;pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark&#x27;, how&#x3D;&#x27;tmux_popup&#x27;})

The main goal here is that remaps become one liners that can just be put
init.vim without creating a whole new lua module for each
telegraph takes in a how argument to determine where to tun the command.j
term(default) runs command in the built in terminal
tmux runs command in a new tmux session and joins it.
tmux_popup runs command in a tmux popup window.
tmux_popup_session runs command in a tmux session and displays it in a popup
subprocess runs command in a subprocess
The current set of format strings that can be used with telegraph.  Placing
{} within your command will get rendered into something with
cword - the current word under the cursor
cWORD - the current BIG Word under the cursor
cline - the current line under the cursor
filepath - the filepath of the current file
filename - the filename of the current file
parent - the parent directory of the current file
current_session_name - name of the current tmux session
cwd - the current working directory
Check out the repo and give
it a star if its something that interests you.</span>

From companies to consumers, we believe everyone has a responsibility to make technology as secure as possible. For Auth0, this means building secure processes, technology, tools, and a culture of trust that puts people at the center. So this year we want you to join us for our first-ever custom Capture The Flag (CTF) with Hack The Box from October 18th to October 25th.
A CTF or Capture The Flag is a cybersecurity competitive game where you have to solve or hack different types of challenges to gain access to a string -the flag- which looks something like this: HTB{m1_f1rst_fl4g}
You enter that flag into Hack The Box and get points depending on the difficulty of the challenge. The team w‚Ä¶</span>

A little bit about me. I&#x27;m a newcomer to the DevOps world and right now I try to understand what should I, as a junior DevOps, know and use to monitor IT infrastructure successfully.
My first major tasks sounded frightened to me at first. But, later, I understood that I just need to find the right solution that is accompanied by automation, so I can confidently rely on it. So, my goal was to find a SaaS to monitor a big IT ecosystem, prevent downtimes, analyze log data, etc.
I went through different blogs, forums, review websites, and the systems I came across everywhere were Datadog, New Relic, Zabbix, ELK, etc. Thanks to my team, we decided to test all of them and then decide which one is our favorite.
We started with Datadog. I can admit as a person, who doesn&#x27;t have a strong‚Ä¶</span>

Welcome to the second insertion to my Learning Typescript series, where I will be learning Typescript and passing on the glorious knowledge. 
While the last submission dealt more with what Typescript is and when it is most beneficial to use, this article will deal more with viewing some beginner code to lay some nice groundwork, ya dig?

As mentioned previously, Typescript is a superset of Javascript, so we are able to access JS&#x27;s primitive types available in JS. 
string - anything enclosed in  &#x27; &#x27;  or  &quot; &quot;
number - any number value
boolean - a value of true or false


null - an absence of value
undefined - when no value is assigned before using variable or object

  Introduction


In this series of articles, we are going to learn how to create generic models and services step-by-step regarding the CRUD feature of resources in Angular.
In a nutshell, we&#x27;re going to learn:
How to use generics in Typescript
What is CRUD operations in APIs
How to create generic models in Angular
How to create generic service for CRUD in Angular

                    <span>While TypeScript is a godsend for React developers, its syntax is fairly intimidating to newcomers. I think generics are a big part of that: they look weird, their purpose isn&#x27;t obvious, and they can be quite hard to parse.
This article aims to help you understand and demystify TypeScript generics in general, and their application to React in particular. They aren&#x27;t that complex: if you understand functions, then generics aren&#x27;t that far off.
To understand generics, we&#x27;ll first start by comparing a standard TypeScript type to a JavaScript object.
// a JavaScript object
const user &#x3D; {
  name: &#x27;John&#x27;,
  status: &#x27;online&#x27;,
};

// and its TypeScript type
type User &#x3D; {
  name: string;
  status: string;
};

As you can see, very close. The main difference is that in JavaScript you care about the v‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>We all agreed about not manipulating data inside component or better to say presentation layer.
So I decided to put logout logic inside guard, this way I will be able to just call logout route and done!
For this I&#x27;ve configured my authentication module routes like this:
{
    path: &#x27;login&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false }
  },
  {
    path: &#x27;register&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: true }
  },
  {
    path: &#x27;logout&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false },
    canActivate: [LogoutGuard]
  }

I love to keep things as simple and low as possible üòÅ
For log out I&#x27;ve added canActivate field and passed the LogoutGuard, the guards have the ability to return UrlTree. It is awesome, let&#x27;s see how the guard implemented:
@Injectable()
export class LogoutGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {
  }

  canActivate(): UrlTree {
    this.store.dispatch(logout());
    return this.router.createUrlTree([&#x27;auth&#x27;, &#x27;login&#x27;]);
  }
}

That&#x27;s it!
The canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!
After this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.

                    <span>I recently had the honor of working with a neighbor beginning his development journey. He is taking a course through his employer and using a work computer with Windows installed.
Initially, I saw that he was using Git Bash ... mostly unsuccessfully. In particular, the Angular CLI was failing with command not found. He apparently had figured out some creative npx commands.
I wanted something simpler for him.
Knowing he had NodeJS installed, we set the path to the Angular CLI and made a custom shortcut to the NodeJS Command Prompt.
We followed the rabbit hole and found the Angular CLI in the following location ...
C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\@angular\cli

Then, we opened the Environment Variables and added this to the Path. This ensures that we are able to reference the CLI in the command prompt later.


Then, we located the NodeJS Command Prompt shortcut ...
C:\Program Files\nodejs

We then copied the shortcut and placed it on the desktop to make things a bit easier.
The biggest change we made to the shortcut was to set the &quot;Start In&quot; folder to the root of his projects folder ... we got to these settings by Right-Clicking and selecting Properties.

This simple setup gave him much more flexibility without any hassles for Angular development using the CLI.</span>

                    <span>Monitoring services is a big part of Cloud Infrastructure Management.  Here we will go through one way to install Prometheus on Ubuntu and make pretty dashboards with Grafana on a separate machine.
Go grab this download and extract to start:
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.11.1/prometheus-2.11.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

tar -xvzf prometheus-2.11.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

cd prometheus/

./prometheus

Should be great success:

Open a web browser and head over to the http://{IP}:9090/graph



Let&#x27;s run it as a service, create this file:
/etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service

And give it this basic text settings:
