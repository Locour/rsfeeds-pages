                    <span>When you are using AWS, there are times when you have to worry about the price.
However, I wondered if this was true, so I tested the theory that AWS&#x27; Northern Virginia region (us-east-1) is not necessarily the least expensive.
There were a few services that did not have the lowest rates in the Northern Virginia region (us-east-1) of AWS.
I have the impression that the AWS tariffs are not very specific about comparing regions.
The following services were surveyed.

                    <span>What is Wordpress?


WordPress is the simplest, most popular way to create your own website or blog. In fact, WordPress powers over 40.0% of all the websites on the Internet. Yes – more than one in four websites that you visit are likely powered by WordPress!
To begin go to the AWS Control Panel and find the search bar. 
Lightsail and click the first service. Now you should see something like the following:

Create instance. Now scroll down and you will see Lightsail by default selected Wordpress. 
$5/month deal. Name your instance and then press the big button saying Create instance. Now wait 3 minutes for your VM (Instance) to load up. To know it is loaded up you will see the Wordpress icon blue and not gray. 
13.59.157.149. Once copied go to your broswer and paste it in with the following line:
13.59.157.149/wp-admin

You should see the following:

user is user but to find the password we need to go back to the terminal.
cat bitnami_application_password

Select the output and paste it into the password. Once you logged in you are done! You should see the following once logged in:

This lab 4 is a new device to be added to ssg. Instead of entering and executing a command for each desired function, if you enter -c or --config config.json using the config.json file, the It should be executed based on the command and the value of the command, and I was assigned a requirement to work in the ssg of another student, not my ssg.
Actually, I already felt tired of entering each command separately every time I run ssg, and personally I was thinking similar to lab4, so I really liked this requirement and felt good. Unfortunately, it was a collaboration with a student other than my code, so while I was looking for a suitable collaborator, a student named Hung Nguyen wanted to collaborate with me, so I decided to work together.

Now to figure out how to approach it. 
As I was figuring out how I wanted to work on this, my mind was on simple and to the point as we just want to create the file client-side. I found https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-saver to which suits my needs. Now all that&#x27;s left is to implement the exportCSV function. 
In my typescript file,  I added the following:

Reactive Extensions of JavaScript is a library for reactive programming. It is commonly known for its operators. The RxJS Operators are also known as Observable Operators.
What are Operators?
Operators are pure functions. They take observable as input and return output as observable.
map– a transformation operator works similar to Array.prototype.map
switchMap– cancels the inner observable when outer observable emits a value
catchError– catches the error and passes to error handling function
debounceTime– discards values if emitted in less than specified time
takeUntil– automatically unsubscribes from an observable
distinctUntilChanged– emits only distinct values and duplicate…</span>

RxJS is Reactive Extensions of JavaScript. It is a library to work with Observables which make developers life easier. RxJS provides various operators to work with in Angular.

What is RxJS forkJoin
Is it deprecated ?
I will explain what I mean!
Initially forkJoin was accepting object arguments as rest parameter. That is deprecated and no longer used.
Now they updated the operator and ask to provide array of observables instead of object arguments. As the line itself saying in above screenshot- @deprecated

                    <span>My, since a little while beautiful, app called What?! was a little slow when opening files. A lot slower since the version before the big redesign. When you changed a lot it is hard to find a starting point. What you can do about this? You already read the title so you know the answer. Tldr; just try it.
The console.log() function is something most JS developers know, you can output anything to the console (for Node as well as the browser). I think a lot of developers do not know about console.time() though. Probably something you will use a lot less, but can be very useful.
Okay, so let’s find that slow little bastard of a function. What you need to know:
console.time(‘example’) will start a timer, where you also give it a name. You can start multiple timers (simultaneously), if choose di…</span>

After navigating to the “Create a new repository” page, add in your desired repository name, choose if you want your repo to be “Public” or “Private”, and you could (optionally) provide a description for what your project is all about.
I would advise that you leave the others unchecked for now to pre…</span>

                    <span>Secrets are a pain to manage and If you are using Ansible to maintain your application and its components there is a better way to do it. In this article, we see how Doppler can help us to simply and quickly manage environment variables for a complex system called Open edX. 
Open edX is an open-source platform you can use to create and host online courses. It was originally developed in 2012 by MIT and Harvard University and has since been adopted by organizations of all shapes and sizes to power a wide range of online learning use cases.
We use Ansible to provision and maintain our platform. If you are not familiar with Ansible, it&#x27;s an open source Devops tool that automates the software provisioning and configuration. It building blocks are:

                    <span>Let&#x27;s talk about serverless CI/CD services provided by the Cloud Providers - we&#x27;ll review the options and look at how to configure them.




Cloud Collective is a meetup for technologists interested in the Cloud Native approach towards developing and deploying web &amp; mobile applications, streaming analytics, ETL pipelines, microservices, containers, functions, and applying Infrastructure as Code principles for automating infrastructure on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
This CI/CD crash course will help you understand exactly what managed CI/CD services from AWS, Azure, GCP, and GitHub are, how to configure them, and also the pros and cons of each vs. a self-hosted one.

                    <span>My latest project has been to re-create my homelab using cloud native principles such as Infrastructure-as-Code and Dev(Git)Ops.
After much research and deliberation, I&#x27;ve concluded the best way for me to achieve this is to separate my local hardware from the software which will run on it. Essentially, I&#x27;ll be treating my hardware as a &quot;local cloud&quot;, and create VM Images that I will deploy running my application stack. (Azure Stack HCI has the right idea here!)
When developing and testing on cloud providers, they always have a base image available to use as a starting off point. Not so for my local cloud!
In this article, I&#x27;ll demonstrate how to create a cloud-init enabled Ubuntu 20.04 LTS base image to use on Proxmox VE.

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic forced the world to rethink not only their lives but also their business operations. There was a pressing need for organizations to transition into a new operating model to be able to thrive. A complete shift to virtual working and protecting sensitive data were at the crux of this model. Virtual working entails cloud computing which as a result entails the risk of security breaches and sensitive information being leaked or deleted. This is precisely what Microsoft recently warned its customers about.
Microsoft&#x27;s Azure Cosmos DB, a global multi-model database service, had a vulnerability in its primary read-write key that could be exploited to access the databases held by thousands of companies. This discovery accompanies months of bad security-related incidents for t…</span>

                    <span>By the end of 2021, the IT outsourcing market will surpass $413.72 billion. The growing demand for software solutions is leading to dramatic growth in outsourcing. Today, many companies outsource projects to a custom software development company to reap the benefits of high-quality products at a lower cost.
But is cost the only reason to outsource software development company? While it may be a significant factor, there are a lot of other things that play a major role in enabling companies to decide whether outsourcing for custom software development is a good idea or not. Since there is a high demand for digital software solutions and products, the outsourcing market is not just based on cost anymore.

                    <span>Have you ever wondered if you could extend GitHub to perform specific actions, or use features that reflect your team&#x27;s workflow? GitHub Apps can do that for you. 
GitHub Apps are applications that give you access to GitHub APIs, so that you can build integrations with GitHub, with the benefits of productivity, flexibility and reduced friction in your workflow. They can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts, and granted access to specific repositories. They come with granular permissions and built-in webhooks.
To improve your workflow, you can create a GitHub App that contains multiple scripts or an entire application, and then connect that app to many other tools. For example, you can connect GitHub Apps to GitHub or Slack. For the Knative project, we have a GitHub App …</span>

Nowadays, eCommerce B2B software providers and developers need to build API integration between their solutions and multiple shopping platforms and marketplaces. This is required if they&#x27;re going to provide their services to e-retailers that host their online stores on different platforms. 
API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of protocols, definitions, and methods that enable services to communicate with each other via a secure digital connection. For instance, APIs allow your eCommerce software to interact with platforms and marketplaces like Amazon, Etsy, Magento to gain unrestricted access to the data stored on them.
API integration platforms enable various apps and software to communicate info between multiple APIs.

Now, let&#x27;s create a folder &quot;entities&quot; which will contain all the entities related to user. 
Here we used @Entity to define an entity. The entity contains many properties and these properties can be defined with either @Property(), @ManyToOne(), @OneToMany(), etc. These are known as decorators, to know more about these checkout out Decorator Ref…</span>

                    <span>What comes to your mind when you think of handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript? Perhaps you still prefer using call back based code? Or as a modern developer you might be using super awesome Promises? If you are a 10x developer then you might be using Observables! In this article we will look at both data structures (Promises or Observables) briefly and which one of them we should be using in 2021.
Promises are one of the coolest features of working with JavaScript, they can help you reduce a lot of call back functions, throw in the await/async syntax and you are dealing with asynchronous code as if you were writing synchronous code and still reducing lines of code and multiple .then chaining. 
Observables are an ergonomic way of dealing with streams of asynchronous event/data as…</span>

                    <span>Wondering how to create a freakin&#x27; livin&#x27; alive an&#x27; kickin&#x27; Chatbot with XP 0? Then fear not my Brave Dev, here we go onto conquering the kingdom of chatbots! Yay! Who&#x27;s excited?
Well, as all amazing stories init from the village of &quot;npm init&quot;. Let&#x27;s init our adventure.
Create a folder, open it in your beloved editor, (mine VS Code). Then type the following commands on your terminal
npm init -y

(It&#x27;ll create package.json file to track all the packages you&#x27;d download and so on)
Now create an app.ts file, let the adventure begin!!
Let&#x27;s create the API where the bot will live. You can use anything, restify, hapi, loopback, express or anything. I&#x27;m goin&#x27; with express. Why? Because it&#x27;s express-y haha!
For those who are a bit lost on how to create an express server with typescript, check this …</span>

                    <span>Motivations


At Promyze, our PaaS provider CleverCloud offers many great features and add-ons to run Web apps. However, there are currently limitations for managing access logs and route them to an external system, such as an ELK stack. CleverCloud allows for draining server logs to Elasticsearch, but there&#x27;s no parsing option, and our logs are considered a single string object.   
We&#x27;re interested in having access logs available to set up monitoring of our API and compute statistics on our traffic. 
In this post, we&#x27;re going to use Morgan, a request logger middleware for node.js to use in combination with Express, to create access logs, send them to an Elasticsearch database and visualize reports with Kibana.

In this article, let us learn about one of the most important concepts that you as a backend developer must have a solid knowledge of (because anyways working with an API is a big part of your jobs) and that is REST APIs

Actual definition:
&quot;&quot;
Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the World Wide Web. REST defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave. The REST architectural style emphasises the scalability of interactions between components, uniform interfaces, independent deployment of components, and the creation of a layered architecture to facilitate caching component…</span>

                    <span>What is NodeJs?
Nodejs is a javascript runtime environment. So, what exactly is the javascript runtime? You may be familiar with the term javascript. Javascript is a programming language that you may use to control your DOM in your browser and helps to play with the page loaded in the browser. It is a browser-based scripting language that allows you to interact with a page after it has been loaded, making it a critical component in developing interactive user interfaces in the browser. However, javascript has other exciting uses as well. Nodejs is a modified version of javascript with added features.

So, in a nutshell, Node.js takes javascript and places it in a new environment. You might say that allows you to run javascript code on the server, but it can theoretically run on any system.…</span>

                    <span>Hey everyone 👋🏻,
In this article, let us learn about indexes in MongoDB. 

Indexes is a typical database feature that can help us in retrieving the data efficiently. Indexes are features that can drastically increase the speed of your query if used in a correct manner. But if you used used incorrectly they can also slow down some of the operations
So let us see what we will cover in this article : 
What are indexes ? 
Different Types Of indexes 
Using and Optimizing indexes
An index can speed up our find, update or delete queries, basically all the queries where we are looking for some documents that match some criteria. 
Let us see an example: 
db.books.find({author : &quot;Alex&quot;})
Here in this query, since no index is there Mongodb will perform a 
books collection where the name of the auth…</span>

                    <span>gRPC is a modern open-source high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment. And in this article, I am going to teach you how you can use gRPC to create high-performance RPC apps using node.js and typescript.
gRPC is a technology developed at Google in 2015. It is an RPC framework that will help you create RPC applications in many of your favorite languages. If you don&#x27;t know what RPC is don&#x27;t worry I&#x27;m going to explain it soon. This technology is used by google itself too. It is used quite a lot with microservice structures. according to Evaluating Performance of REST vs. gRPC from Ruwan Fernando gRPC is roughly 7 times faster than REST when receiving data and roughly 10 times faster than REST when sending data in the case he tested.

Batizada de Mariana Trench (MT) e distribuida de forma Open Source a ferramenta está em constante evolução e suporte pelo time de engenharia do Facebook. Ela é usada hoje em milhões de linhas de código no Whatsapp, Instagram e, claro, no próprio app do Facebook. Segundo o Facebook, na primeira metade de 2021, 50% das vulnerabilidades encontradas foram de forma automatizada.
O MT foi desenvolvido em Python e roda de forma estática no código. Está disponível (aqui)[https://github.com/facebook/mariana-trench/). O Facebook também deixou pronto um tutorial para facilitar nos primeiros passos. O tutorial pode ser acessado (aqui)[https://mariana-tren.ch/docs/getting-started/].</span>

A hash fragment in the URL (i.e. www.mypage.com/article#fragment) to the anchor name is the value of either the name or id attribute when used in the context of anchors.
According to w3.org, it must observe two rules, Uniqueness: is said must be unique within a document, and String matching: Comparisons between fragment identifiers and anchor names must be done by exact (case-sensitive) match.
The id attribute may be used to create an anchor at the start tag of any element.
This example illustrates the use of the id attribute to position an anchor in an H2 element.

Then it got forced upon me and I had no choice but to learn it while at the same time learning a new framework. That was very hard indeed as I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was learning something React or something TypeScript. Separating the two would have been a whole lot easier.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re a boot camper like me, you may know that most coding boot camps teach more functional programming than anything. You may also know languages that strongly favor functional patterns are the roots of the skills taught at boot camps. This includes languages like JavaScript (JS) and Python. What is the problem with this?
At least Python&#x27;s type-safe rating is &quot;strong.&quot; JS&#x27;s type-safe rating is &quot;weak.&quot; Let&#x27;s talk about JS. JavaScript has been the most-loved and the most-hated programming language all at once for quite some time now. A lot of the hate for JavaScript is due to its absence of a strict typing system. Where a language such as Java will crucify you for a null check, JavaScript says, &quot;A string divided by a string? Yeah, that might work. Let&#x27;s run it.&quot;

En este video vamos a lanzar un &quot;Hola mundo!&quot; en el devnet cluster. El programa consistirá en aumentar un contador de uno en uno cada vez que se ejecute el programa. Para eso, vamos a crear un account que contiene la data, un programa que la opera y una cuenta que ejecuta instrucciones en el programa.

React Context is one of the core React APIs that can be used anytime you are developing with React. Context allows us to create a piece of state that is globally shared among many different components.
At its core, Context helps to solve one main issue: &quot;prop drilling.&quot; Prop drilling is the name for when a property
For example, suppose that we store information about a user&#x27;s application preferences (language, timezone, privacy, etc.) and need to use that to render the application correctly. To render the application, we must write something like:

                    <span>This article is just for my fun. Today I&#x27;m playing with Google Sheets API and got an idea I could play a video in a sheet using cells like pixels.
TL;DR This is the final result!😉 (The following video frame refresh is x10 faster than actual. I edited by a video editor.)

I prepared 160 x 90 cells in a Google Sheet and changed cell colors by using Google Sheets API. The API has a API to change cell colors by one API call in bulk. I called the API for each video frame and played a video.
First, I converted the famous video &quot;Big Bunny&quot; to JPG images by using ffmpeg. I used 1 image per second and generated 300 images. According to my experiments, Google Sheets API needs ~3 sec to refresh cell colors by a API call so I selected much less images than video frames. And I resized the image frame …</span>

We wpisie o zarządzaniu stanem aplikacji w React wspominałem, jak używanie stanu lokalnego wraz z kontekstem może pomóc w zarządzaniu stanem dowolnej aplikacji. Pokazałem tam kilka przykładów do których chciałbym się teraz odnieść, by przedstawić jak efektywnie tworzyć konsumentów kontekstu, unikając problemów, a jednocześnie poprawiając czytelność kodu i ułatwiając jego utrzymanie dla Twoich aplikacji i/lub bibliotek.
Zapoznaj się z zarządzaniem stanu w React i postępuj zgodnie z radą, mówiącą, że nie powinieneś używać kontekstu do rozwiązania każdego problemu ze stanem w aplikacji. Ale kiedy już będziesz zmuszony po niego sięgnąć, mam nadzieję, że ten wpis pomoże ci się dowiedzieć jak skutecznie to zrobić. Pamiętaj, że kontekst NIE musi być …</span>

Well, as all amazing stories init from the village of &quot;npm init&quot;. Let&#x27;s init our adventure.
Create a folder, open it in your beloved editor, (mine VS Code). Then type the following commands on your terminal
npm init -y

(It&#x27;ll create package.json file to track all the packages you&#x27;d download and so on)
Now create an app.ts file, let the adventure begin!!
Let&#x27;s create the API where the bot will live. You can use anything, restify, hapi, loopback, express or anything. I&#x27;m goin&#x27; with express. Why? Because it&#x27;s express-y haha!

  What we&#x27;ll learn in this article


Hi everyone! 👋
Today, I&#x27;m going to share and analyze a pattern that I&#x27;ve become quite fond of recently for managing state management in a way that is truly domain agnostic.
We&#x27;ll do this by first discussing a new pattern for implementing state management code using RxJS in this article. In a follow up article (that I&#x27;ve committed to releasing next friday), we&#x27;ll demonstrate its &quot;domain agnosticism&quot; by using the same code to create a small app in vanilla JS [by which I simply mean &quot;JS without a framework/library&quot;], Angular, and React.
There&#x27;s something of a perquisite of some more basic JS knowledge, and familiarity with RxJS would helpful…</span>

                    <span>Angular é um framework JavaScript de código aberto amplamente usado para o desenvolvimento de Single Page Applications (SPA) mas que também pode ser usado em aplicações completas que fazem requisições a um servidor. (Procure mais sobre a stack MEAN -- MongoDB, Express.js, Angular e Node.js, uma solução inteira escrita em JavaScript)
Se pensarmos em frameworks e sua curva de aprendizado, podemos dizer que Vue é um framework relativamente fácil de aprender, seguido de ReactJS (que tecnicamente é uma lib), e depois vem o Angular. Então por que eu aprenderia Angular e não outro framework?
Angular é um framework bem completinho. Ele vem com algumas bibliotecas já incluídas, como router e http, por exemplo. Ele tem Typescript integrado, mas você não precisa escrever em Typescript se não quiser. …</span>

                    <span>Every developer aims to create internet apps and websites that scale well and have Fort Knox-level security. And each consumer requires the use of such a product. As a result, selecting the most appropriate and dependable technologies for your projects is critical. Both Angular and PHP have applied sciences, and thus this can create confusion as to what can be the best option for developers to choose from in 2021.
So, before we move to compare them, let us first understand what PHP and Angular are.
Angular is an open-source framework that is TypeScript based and used to build applications for desktops and websites.
The Angular project was directed by the Angular Team at Google and built with the aid of a large community of businesses and individuals. Angular is also known as “Angular 2+” o…</span>

                    <span>For SSR and node.js usage of Angular, we may need to have a Promise complete before the page is loaded. This is especially true when we need to create meta tags for SEO. Yes, our app is slower, but we have to get it indexable.
Every wonder why your meta tags seem to work sometimes, but not other times? It is because ngOnInit is NOT an async function, even with async, neither is a constructor which must return this, and neither is an async pipe in your template. Sometimes the fetches return on time, other times they don&#x27;t. So, I added this post:
ngOnInit does NOT wait for the promise to complete. You can make it an async function if you feel like using await like so:
import { take } from &#x27;rxjs/operators&#x27;;

async ngOnInit(): Promise {
  const data &#x3D; await this.service.getData().pipe(tak…</span>

                    <span>The other day I was stoked when I got to use Argo Tunnels, its a neat piece of software that builds a bridge to the internet from your local machine, I wrote about it a few days back Argo Tunnels are fun!

The problem with me is I have an interest based learning, if the project doesn&#x27;t interest me I won&#x27;t be able to go ahead with it. So I decided to update my portfolio! but using Continuous deployment, podman and Argo tunnels!
Gitlab Runner Setup using podman
Cloudflared tunnel setup using systemd
Continuous deployment using Gitlab CI/CD using containers!!
Running a completely rootless setup
Lets get started with cloudflared installation and setup.

                    <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m Dustin, and today I want to talk about the experience of adding new feature for a static site generator written by Vivian.
A SSG is a command line tool that helps users to convert .txt files or .md files into .html files. 
This project is quite fun and offers me a bunch of new knowledge.
First off, I created an issue mentioning about what I wanted to improve in on her code. I listed all the necessary tasks to be done and sent the issue. After she accepted and assigned me to the issue, I started to write code right away and created a pull request for the code I wrote. It&#x27;s actually not a big deal for me at all because her code was pretty clean and understandable. Although she requested a few changes in my code, everything went well and my pull request got merged right after that.
Same thing happens in my code I guess because we had no trouble understanding each other&#x27;s code. The process was quite straight forward, she filed an issue -&gt; I accepted it -&gt; she coded it -&gt; I requested some changes as she added some extra lines that were not necessary. However, there was one thing I had to do which is pulling her code into my machine so that I could test it out. While testing her code, I just realized that I had a quite big bug in my code that I didn&#x27;t know about. However, her issue was just for the new feature about config file, so I decided to create another issue about the bug I mentioned above and resolved it after her code got merged.

Are you sure you are ensuring your code to be used as intended? Are you preventing it from beeing used in a malicious way?
If what comes your way is putting guards in your functions, this post will open up a world for you as this one was for me. Using checks is not enough.
You will be both wolf and sheep. I created the function below so that it had everything you need to learn attack and related defenses from the techniques:
Probing &amp; Double Getter
Prototype Bribing

One of the great benefits of Doppler is keeping your project in sync. We want to be able to sync our app wherever we develop and deploy. It only takes a few minutes to integrate the Vercel marketplace with Doppler, and that is what we will be doing in this tutorial
In this tutorial we will learn how to install the Doppler integration from Vercel’s new marketplace. Learn how to sync the secrets in your doppler project for deployment.
The first thing we want to do is to login to our doppler account. I won’t be touching the details of creating an account and login into doppler, because I have already done an introduction to doppler in a previous post. So once we have logged into Doppler, we head over to Vercel and add our project we want to integerate doppler with.

                    <span>Running an e-commerce website is hard enough, and dealing with security threats is among the major challenges to address in 2021. As the COVID-19 pandemic pushed customers towards e-commerce, its share of total retail sales has been significantly increased since 2020 and is expected to grow in the coming years. With e-commerce being on the rise, fraudsters are hot on the track of online shopping businesses and their customers. 
According to a Juniper research report, e-commerce retailers are at risk of losing over $20 billion in 2021 due to online fraudulent activities. This represents an 18% increase, compared to $17.5 billion recorded last year. Thus, it’s essential to be aware of security aspects to be able to prevent security breaches.

                    <span>Part I of the series described the filesystem layout and how the runtime jails the container process inside the root filesystem of the container.
Part 0 briefly explained the clone syscall. It&#x27;s like fork/vfork, but with more options to control the child process. Actually, some implementations of fork propagate the call to clone().
Besides controlling which parts of the execution context get shared from the parent process, the clone call offers the possibility for us to create a separate memory block for the child&#x27;s stack. The nix implementation of clone has the following signature:
pub fn clone(
 cb: CloneCb, 
 stack: &amp;mut [u8], 
 flags: CloneFlags, 
 signal: Option
) -&gt; Result

The signal argument, if specified, is sent back to the parent when the child process terminates…</span>

It is more likely than not that Docker and containers are going to be part of your IT career in one way or another.
In this blog post series I&#x27;ll cover the following:
  What are Docker images, containers and Docker Hub
  Installing Docker on Ubuntu Linux on a DigitalOcean Droplet
  Working with Docker containers
  Working with Docker images
  Deploying a Dockerized app
I&#x27;ll be using DigitalOcean for all of the demos, so I would strongly encourage you to create a DigitalOcean account follow along. You would learn more by doing!
To make things even better you can use my referral link to get a free $100 credit that you could use to deploy your virtual machines and test the guide yourself on a few DigitalOcean servers:

  Introduction


In this series of articles, we are going to learn how to create generic models and services step-by-step regarding the CRUD feature of resources in Angular.
In a nutshell, we&#x27;re going to learn:
How to use generics in Typescript
What is CRUD operations in APIs
How to create generic models in Angular
How to create generic service for CRUD in Angular
One of the most important principles in programming is the &quot;Don&#x27;t-Repeat-Yourself&quot; (DRY) principle wh…</span>

                    <span>We all agreed about not manipulating data inside component or better to say presentation layer.
So I decided to put logout logic inside guard, this way I will be able to just call logout route and done!
For this I&#x27;ve configured my authentication module routes like this:
{
    path: &#x27;login&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false }
  },
  {
    path: &#x27;register&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: true }
  },
  {
    path: &#x27;logout&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false },
    canActivate: [LogoutGuard]
  }

I love to keep things as simple and low as possible 😁
For log out I&#x27;ve added canActivate field and passed the LogoutGuard, the guards have the ability to return UrlTree. It is awesome, let&#x27;s see how the guard implemented:
@Injectable()
export class LogoutGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {
  }

  canActivate(): UrlTree {
    this.store.dispatch(logout());
    return this.router.createUrlTree([&#x27;auth&#x27;, &#x27;login&#x27;]);
  }
}

That&#x27;s it!
The canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!
After this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.

                    <span>I have always wanted to access private servers (accessed only through VPN or SSH tunnels) through domains without going through the hassle of locally modifying hosts files in the client side (me and my colleagues) or the SSH config files, so here&#x27;s my attempt to solve this problem.
I used a t3a.nano AWS EC2 instance to demonstrate the idea with Ubuntu 20.04 on it, with OpenVPN as my VPN server and dnsmasq as a DNS server.
I used dnsmasq instead of something like BIND because it&#x27;s much easier to setup and maintain. 
This was made only for demonstration purpose, so to quickly setting up an OpenVPN server without pain I used angristan/openvpn-install script to do so.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angristan/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh

                    <span>Transferring files to servers is a vital task in most software developers&#x27; life. Usually, we use protocols like FTP (File Transfer Protocol), FTPS, SFTP to transfer files. In this tutorial, we are going to briefly discuss the available protocols and their differences. Also, the tutorial will explain how to transfer files from client to server, server to client and server to server using SCP.
FTP is an old and insecure protocol that can be used to transfer files between local networks or computers connected through the Internet. However, FTP is not recommended to use to transfer files over the Internet anymore as it transfers usernames and passwords in cleartext. In addition to that, FTP provides an anonymous method that let you transfer files even without a username and password.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve slowly adding more and more lua functions into my neovim configuration,





  
  
  Telegraph.nvim


Check out the project readme
I want a simple way to make remaps into shell commands that can open new tmux
For example I want to make remaps to do things like open the current file in lookatme.
# vim :terminal
nnoremap s Telegraph pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark

# tmux session
nnoremap s lua require&#x27;telegraph&#x27;.telegraph({cmd&#x3D;&#x27;pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark&#x27;, how&#x3D;&#x27;tmux&#x27;})

# tmux popup
nnoremap S lua require&#x27;telegraph&#x27;.telegraph({cmd&#x3D;&#x27;pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark&#x27;, how&#x3D;&#x27;tmux_popup&#x27;})

The main goal here is that remaps become one liners that can just be put
init.vim without creating a whole new lua module for each
telegraph takes in a how argument to determine where to tun the command.j
term(default) runs command in the built in terminal
tmux runs command in a new tmux session and joins it.
tmux_popup runs command in a tmux popup window.
tmux_popup_session runs command in a tmux session and displays it in a popup
subprocess runs command in a subprocess
The current set of format strings that can be used with telegraph.  Placing
{} within your command will get rendered into something with
cword - the current word under the cursor
cWORD - the current BIG Word under the cursor
cline - the current line under the cursor
filepath - the filepath of the current file
filename - the filename of the current file
parent - the parent directory of the current file
current_session_name - name of the current tmux session
cwd - the current working directory
Check out the repo and give
it a star if its something that interests you.</span>
