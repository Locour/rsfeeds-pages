              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Ever wondered how to build a server without using express?
Well, look no further...
 
While a very convenient framework express is not necessary to get up and running with a server built on nodeJS.
Looking at how express operates you'll realize that under the hood it utilizes the http module, and as such you can think of express as a wrapper for http.
With this in mind we shall attempt to spin up a server using the http module alone.
 
The amount of code we need to write to achieve this is minimal.

There are few ways to install Node on your local machine. The most popular way is to install it following official website instructions. But if you use this way you will install just one specific (latest) version of Node. What if you need to install a specific version of Node? Or you need to upgrade from one version to another but only for a short while. 
For that purpose, you can use a tool called nvm (Node Version Manager).

The const assertion was released with TypeScript 3.4. It's a special type of type assertion in the sense that the const keyword is used in place of the type.
By definition, the const assertion has the following effects:
Literal types will not be widened.
Object literals will get readonly properties.
Array literals will become readonly tuples.
