                    <span>When looking for bookmarks or code snippets I recently used, I often find myself use the autocompletion capability of the search box to retrieve them. So over the weekend, I figured out since I do that, why not make it easier. So I did - I added sort of quick access to my last searches directly in the side menu on the landing page. See it in action below:

One tricky part was how to show the whole content of the search query when its length passes a certain limit. That meant when hovering over it, dynamically change the content of the html anchor a element. On top of that the list is dynamically generated out of the last searches. I like challenges and I described in How to change the content of an html element on hover in Angular how I implemented this.
Another interesting aspect of the implementation was how to dynamically set the background color of the displayed search queries - this is described with the snippets and post at Set css class dynamically in Angular from expression
👉 Codever is a bookmarks and snippets manager for developers &amp; co. Give it a try and start saving time and nerves right away.</span>

                    <span>Introduction:


There are multiple frameworks being invented for the purpose of simplifying the web development process. It helps increase flexibility and reduces launch time. Without frameworks, modern web development would not be possible as they need to create databases, security options, and various other things from the start.
In this blog, we are talking about, 

Angular was released in 2016 by Google. It is one of the most popular frameworks, and it is best suited for high-performance web and mobile apps as well as complex e-commerce projects. It is not a complete stack platform and can be used for front-end development for client-side applications. Angular uses Typescript front-end technologies, a JavaScript framework superset, along with HTML and CSS. 
It is used by companies like…</span>

                    <span>We are sitting in front of our new project and we need to start coding some new screens but the backend is just not ready yet. Isn&#x27;t that familiar?
It is a good practice to have some sort of mocking mechanism so we can start coding as soon as we can and also make our unit testing less error prone by using well known data.
Yes, but that sounds overly complicated to achieve. We need to turn off and on the backend, swap modules around to enable or disable the mocking and be careful to not deploy any of that the production.
Well, not anymore.
MSW as they say, is the API mocking of the next generation. Right, but what does that mean? It works by intercepting requests on the network level or in other words, by using a service worker.

Leverage The Power of Habit is to build productive routines.

And now that I can pinpoint that it was because I was building A habit out of the things I want to be productive on that. I was able to make a routine and start cranking out code videos work stuff.

                    <span>Best Practices


Forgive me, the Bart Simpson in me couldn&#x27;t resist using &#x27;Best Practices&#x27; once again. Sure, there&#x27;s a lot to say to stamp out “best practice” and I agree with most arguments in the article. Framing something as a best practice is subjective, and it could give the impression of being arrogant. But, as grown-ups, I&#x27;m convinced most of us know how to deal with the term and see why it&#x27;s used. So pick the practices you agree on, which you see as &#x27;best&#x27; practices yourself.
I have the feeling that the importance of API Gateway in a setup is sometimes overlooked. AWS wrote down the practices themselves (also using the term &#x27;Best practices 😉). But IMHO, their documentation is a tad too brief. Also, the documentation lacks a &#x27;WHY&#x27; in general.

Cloud costs for engineering teams
Cloud costs have become so complex that the industry (ourselves included) started addressing issues around breached budgets after the bill arrived. This is not the way it should be. It is like going shopping and having no idea how much things cost till after your card has been charged.
We are on a mission to empower engineering teams to use cloud infrastructure economically and efficiently. We do this by fitting in the developer workflow via CI/CD integration, reading the Infrastructure-as-code project, picking up the parameters that have a price point, looking …</span>

The cost of a millisecond.
TABB Group, a financial services industry research firm, estimates that if a broker&#x27;s electronic trading platform is 5 milliseconds behind the competition, it could cost $4 million in revenue per millisecond.
The cost of latency is too high in the financial services industry, and the same is true for almost any software-based business today. For Google, half a second delay in search results caused a 20% drop in traffic. Half a second is enough to kill user satisfaction to a point where they abandon an app&#x27;s service.
While a user sees a screen, there are thousands of services in the background taking care of a user&#x27;s request. In a microservices architecture, the challenge for engineering teams is to constan…</span>

                    <span>Sample Scenario


Is it possible to make any change to the config file which is having a kind: Pod and use kubectl to that file, well lets see what happens if we try to change the container port.
We are having a config file named client-pod.yml file.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: client-pod
  labels:
    component: web
spec:
  containers:
    - name: client
      image: some image name
      ports:
        - containerPort: 3000

Now I update the containerPort field to 9999
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: client-pod
  labels:
    component: web
spec:
  containers:
    - name: client
      image: some image name
      ports:
        - containerPort: 9999

After changing the port and if we feed this config into kubectl, kubectl apply -f client-pod.yml, the output will be as follows :

Yes we will be getting an error saying we can&#x27;t change the fields other than the fields mentioned in the terminal, so in our case we cannot change the container port.

    
Limitations on Updating Config file
    
Can only change spec.containers[*].image
    
Can only change spec.initContainers[*].image
    
Can only change spec.activeDeadlineSeconds
    
Can only change spec.tolerations</span>

                    <span>tree in Linux


tree command helps to recursively list the directory and its details in a tree format. In this post, we will see how you can use tree effectively to view the directory details.
tree essentials in Linux


To install tree in Ubuntu, Debian Linux distros.
sudo apt-get install tree

To install tree in CentOS:
sudo yum install tree

In Windows, you can issue tree in Windows Terminal.
tree


If you enter tree command without any arguments, it will list out everything from the current directory recursively. Suppose, if you are in your home directory, it will display everything recursively like below.

man tree

.





tree -a

tree -d

tree -f

tree -L 1


tree -P b*


tree backups -P &#x27;SMTP*&#x27;


&#x27;*&#x27; - any zero or more characters
&#x27;?&#x27; - any single character
&#x27;[...]&#x27; - any single character listed between brackets
&#x27;[A-Z]&#x27; - for range
&#x27;[^...]&#x27;- any single character not listed in brackets
&#x27;|&#x27; - separates alternate patterns
tree backups -I &#x27;SMTP*&#x27;


If you use -P which matches both the directories and files. If the match is found for directories, then the matching is disabled for its contents. Use it with --prune to prune it.

To not to print the file and directory report, use --noreport.
tree bin -P &#x27;*.log&#x27; --prune --noreport 

tree bin -P &#x27;*.log&#x27; --prune -J

tree bin -P &#x27;*.log&#x27; --prune -X

tree bin -P &#x27;*.log&#x27; --prune -D

tree bin/ -P &#x27;*.properties&#x27; --prune -h


-F marks directories as * and / for files.
tree -P &#x27;*.jmx&#x27; --prune -F


It displays directories first over files. To disable, use -U.
tree -P &#x27;*.jtl&#x27; --prune --dirsfirst



In this post, we have covered frequently used tree commands. Please check my blog for more such tutorials.

                    <span>Introduction


Vim is quite a powerful text editor which can add performance to the already fast typed language Python. Vim can be highly customizable and efficient to use as it has the power of adding custom plugins and plugins managers, key mappings, and the most critical weapon of vim - Access to the terminal straight away.
So let us start making Vim, the text editor suitable for a python programmer. Firstly we&#x27;ll need the vim plugin manager. There are different plugin managers out there, each of them has the same purpose to install, upgrade and manage the plugins for vim. You can install any one of them and get up and running.

These are some of the finest and well-supported plugin managers in vim. You can use any of these plugin managers, and get started …</span>

                    <span>Have you accidentally deleted some information, formatted the hard disk or realized your NAS device is out of order? Read this article to find out how to recover data from a RAID system based on NAS QNAP TS-412.

A QNAP NAS storage system consists of several hard disks. To improve resilience and data safety, such devices enable you to create RAID systems of various types. However, even the most reliable storage systems may encounter emergencies like accidental deletion of files, formatting or damaging the hard disk, system errors, controller failures and other hardware issues, which may result in loss of important data.

If NAS works properly and you just removed some important files by accident, you can try restoring them from the Network Recycle Bin.

                    <span>In Linux systems, by default, the history does not include a timestamp, which can be annoying when you want to see when a command was executed to determine an update or some kind.
So today, I&#x27;ll be showing you how to enable timestamps for the bash history in Linux.
Before we get started, let&#x27;s look at how the history works and which files are attached.
The bash history is kept so we can retrieve whatever actions some user did.
To retrieve this history, we can type the following command.
history

It should come back with something that looks like this.

To find where this file is located you can run the following command.
echo $HISTFILE

It will generally come back with a location like:
/root/.bash_history

However, to change the history output, we have to make a change in the configuration settings.
These configuration settings are set in a file called .bashrc.
We need to add the HISTTIMEFORMAT config settings, which will change the output.
There are two ways to include this in your .bashrc file.
Manually open the .bashrc file and paste it in.
Echo it into the file.




# method 1
nano ~/.bashrc
# now paste:
export HISTTIMEFORMAT&#x3D;&quot;%F %T &quot;

# method 2
echo &#x27;export HISTTIMEFORMAT&#x3D;&quot;%F %T &quot;&#x27; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc

The format we are using includes the %F and %T variables which stand for:
%F: full date (year-month-day)
%T: time (hour:minute:seconds)
Now you won&#x27;t see the change yet. We have to enable it, which we can do by rebooting or simply running this command:
source ~/.bashrc

Now when we run the history command, we should see something like this.

As you can see, we now have timestamps in front of our history!

                    <span>A while ago, Node.js introduced support for ECMAScript Modules (ESM). ESM is the standardized modules implementation that&#x27;s been built-in to JavaScript. This differs rather significantly from CommonJS (CJS), which is the module system that Node.js has shipped with for over a decade that make them relatively incompatible.
There are a number of different components of Node.js that have been intentionally structured to allow you to use standard (as in, how the ECMAScript Specification defines it) ESM by default and extend/augment that experience if you&#x27;d like to.
Today, I want to get into one of the baisc elements of ESM in Node.js: the .mjs and .cjs extensions.

What is express?
Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.
Express provides you with a bundle of functions that help you to organize your code better and to focus more on what to do rather than worrying about how it&#x27;s being done, that&#x27;s the magic of all frameworks right?

It&#x27;s pretty straightforward we should be done in a flash so stick with me. This is my first ever write-up 😩 😩  , I hope you find a place in your heart to forgive my grammatical errors.😔 😔  

So, I started learning Typescript recently, and honestly, my life has been a lot easier ever since. Enough said, let&#x27;s jump right in and start coding, shall we? 😎 
Firstly, go to your terminal and navigate to the directory where you&#x27;d like to create your express app, type npx express-generator, hit enter you should see a structure like this automatically generated for you.

After deep thinking, I made up 3 features for the first version of my project:
Sending an email


Scheduling a notification or webhook call


User list collections (Subscribers, future clients, and so on).



What do you think about the potential of the idea? Is it worth to be built?
P.S. In the link below you can see a small graphical content about this platform. Also if you wonder to track the state of the project, you can follow it there.

                    <span>Gulp is a cross-platform, streaming task runner that lets developers automate many development tasks. At a high level, gulp reads files as streams and pipes the streams to different tasks. The set tasks are code-based and use plugins.
If you’ve previously installed gulp globally, run npm rm --global gulp before following these instructions. For more information, read this
To verify that you have node.js installed, run
node --version

If it&#x27;s not, follow the instructions here
You can choose to install gulp globally on your PC by running:
npm install --global gulp-cli

The above command will install gulp-cli globally and you will be able to run the gulp command anywhere, directly from your CLI/terminal.
To install gulp as a one-time dev-dependency in your project:
Let&#x27;s go ahead and create a new project. The mkdir command creates a new folder: my-project, and the cd command navigates to this directory.
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

To get started, we will need to generate a new package.json which will contain basic information about our project, to do this run:
npm init

This will guide you through giving your project a name, version, description, etc.
npm install --save-dev gulp

gulp --version

Using your text editor, create a file named gulpfile.js in your project root with these contents.
function defaultTask(cb){
// place code for default task here
 cb();
}
exports.default&#x3D; defaultTask

From your project directory, run the following command:
gulp

This command will automatically locate your gulpfile.js file and execcute it as a gulp task.
You can also run multiple task with gulp simultaneously by running:
gulp 
 

In this article, we&#x27;ve been able to cover the basics of gulp and how to install it both globally, and also as a one-time devDependency.

What exactly is Node.js?
Node.js, created and published by the reputed software engineer named Ryan Dahl in 2009, was initially compatible with only several selected OS like Mac OS X and Linux. At present, the latest version of Node.JS, 10.16.0, has been released.
Node.js happens to be amongst one of the most well-known and in-demand open-source back-end development environments, which have been written in C++, C#, plus JavaScript programming language, which has been built on the V8 JavaScript engine of Chrome. It is usually known to execute Java…</span>

                    <span>Converting from one type to another (or simply called typecasting) is needed very frequently in any programming language. So is in JavaScript.
Today we are going to take a look at some of the ways to Typecast Strings to Number.
As the name suggests, parseInt the function parses the argument as Integer. Though parseInt is made to parse to String to different kinds of Integers like Decimal, Binary, Octal etc
With the above definition, parseInt accepts two parameters:
string: The value that needs to be converted to an integer
integer: The radix base number between 0 and 32



Examples:
parseInt(&#x27;123&#x27;, 10) // 123
parseInt(&#x27;111&#x27;, 2) // 7
parseInt(&#x27;111&#x27;, 8) // 73
parseInt(&#x27;111&#x27;, 9) // 91
parseInt(&#x27;111&#x27;, 10) // 111
parseInt(&#x27;111&#x27;, 16) // 273
parseInt(&#x27;111&#x27;, 32) // 1057
parseInt(&#x27;111&#x27;, 36) // 1333…</span>

npm init
Hit the enter to given questions. Now install the packages that we need.
npm i googleapis google-auth-library express
Now create a new file named index.js and require the packages

In this tutorial, I will show you how to set up a locally-hosted DynamoDB server, use the AWS NoSQL Workbench to insert data into DynamoDB, and finally, create a simple Node.JS project that will query sample data provided by AWS NoSQL Workbench.
This tutorial assumes you&#x27;re comfortable executing terminal commands, navigating, and modifying the macOS and Ubuntu Linux file system. 
My setup is a hybrid environment consisting of a Host, macOS Catalina, and a Guest Ubuntu VM instance. But You can set up everything on one host, macOS, Ubuntu, or Windows.
To follow along, you will need the following already installed:
On Ubuntu (Guest) or Host:
Docker
Docker Compose
Node.js
On MacOS (Host):

                    <span>Best Practices


Forgive me, the Bart Simpson in me couldn&#x27;t resist using &#x27;Best Practices&#x27; once again. Sure, there&#x27;s a lot to say to stamp out “best practice” and I agree with most arguments in the article. Framing something as a best practice is subjective, and it could give the impression of being arrogant. But, as grown-ups, I&#x27;m convinced most of us know how to deal with the term and see why it&#x27;s used. So pick the practices you agree on, which you see as &#x27;best&#x27; practices yourself.
I have the feeling that the importance of API Gateway in a setup is sometimes overlooked. AWS wrote down the practices themselves (also using the term &#x27;Best practices 😉). But IMHO, their documentation is a tad too brief. Also, the documentation lacks a &#x27;WHY&#x27; in general.

                    <span>📓 HIPAA and HITECH both provide legal guidelines for managing protected health information in the United States. Here is what businesses need to know to comply.


If your business processes protected health information (PHI) in the United States, you’ll need to familiarize yourself with both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act.
Both pieces of legislation provide legal guidelines for managing PHI in the United States and come with strict penalties for violations. For example, two health care networks were fined $5.5M each in two of the worst violations in recent history.
However, each law manages and protects health data in different ways (and for different reasons). Below is a summary of what each law could mean for your business if it processes PHI in any format.

HIPAA and HITECH are two separate laws with two different goals:
HIPAA was passed in 1996 and was the first U.S. law to regulate how protected health information was managed. It introduced a set of security controls and privacy rights aimed at reducing fraud and waste in health care. HIPAA defined who was required to comply with its regulations (which HIPAA called “covered entities”) and how they were required to do so in order to protect health data.
The HITECH Act was passed in 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to encourage HIPAA-covered entities to adopt electronic health records (EHRs) for managing PHI. It offered financial incentives from 2011 to 2015 to transition to EHRs and to improve the delivery of healthcare. The HITECH Act also introduced new technical security standards (in addition to a few other things below) that complement and enhance HIPAA as well.

The primary driver for this adoption being, faster delivery of products, independent teams, and generally better all-around synergy between the engineering and operations team.
In this DevOps and Agile world, the traditional modes of quality assurance, like manual testing, are not as effective when it comes to quality assurance. Granted, risk analysis, test planning, and test management are still important, but to ensure the same level of quality in an Agile world as before, or even better, organizations are using new skills such as test automation, data analytics, and AI technologies amongst others.

                    <span>For a while Ive been interested in not only Rust but WASM but having limited familiarity with many of the languages that can be compiled to WASM I never really had a chance to try it out until recently. Over the last few months though I got the opportunity to learn Rust.
Rust in my opinion is very much like typescript on steroids. While Typescript may enforce types in your code if you happen to pass a string to a type expecting a number things will still compile and may even work as expected still. With Rust this is not the case. If you provide an unexpected type either things will not compile in the first place or your software will crash.

const someObj &#x3D; { tags: [], packages: [] };
function hasValue(key, item) {
  return someObj[key].indexOf(item) !&#x3D;&#x3D; -1;

And you are porting this this into TypeScript. You are trying to follow best practices, like using strict mode. And don’t want to use any and unsafe casts. so you start adding types:
type SomeType &#x3D; {
  tags: (string | number)[];
  packages: string[];
};
const someObj: SomeType &#x3D; { tags: [], packages: [] };

This was easy, but then you hit one issue that you can’t really write type for hasValue without using some sort of casting. This is your best attempt:
function hasValue(key: K, item: SomeType[K]) {

                    <span>Hi guys, in this article, I&#x27;d show you how to convert an express-generator app to Typescript. It&#x27;s pretty straightforward we should be done in a flash so stick with me. This is my first ever write-up 😩 😩  , I hope you find a place in your heart to forgive my grammatical errors.😔 😔  

So, I started learning Typescript recently, and honestly, my life has been a lot easier ever since. Enough said, let&#x27;s jump right in and start coding, shall we? 😎 
Firstly, go to your terminal and navigate to the directory where you&#x27;d like to create your express app, type npx express-generator, hit enter you should see a structure like this automatically generated for you.

                    <span>Query Keys are a very important core concept in React Query. They are necessary so that the library can internally cache your data correctly and refetch automatically when a dependency to your query changes. Lastly, it will allow you to interact with the Query Cache manually when needed, for example when updating data after a mutation or when you need to manually invalidate some queries.
Let&#x27;s quickly have a look what these three points mean before I&#x27;ll show you how I personally organize Query Keys to be able to do these things most effectively.
Internally, the Query Cache is just a JavaScript object, where the keys are serialized Query Keys and the values are your Query Data plus meta information. The keys are hashed it in a deterministic way, so you can use objects as well (on the top le…</span>

Good question! In fact, if you are happy with create-react-app — just use it 🙂 But if you want to figure out how everything works together, let&#x27;s combine all parts ourselves!

Node.js installation steps depend on your system — just proceed to a download page and follow instructions.
npm doesn&#x27;t need any installation because it comes with Node. If you wish to check that everything is properly installed on your system, follow these instructions.
Sidenote: npm is not the only package manager, there&#x27;s also Yarn. If uncertain, I&#x27;d recommend staying with npm.

I just can&#x27;t stop writing these generic functions! This is another powerful generic function that follows my previous post on building a generic function to update an array at a specific key according to a specific test value. As I try and maintain the cleanest codebase as possible for ReduxPlate, I continue to find new use cases for these easy-to-use yet powerful generic functions.
Often when doing state modifications, you want to merge or add some properties to an object that you get from an API or some other source. You could explicitly write key / value assignments for the keys that you want to update... or you can leverage JavaScript&#x27;s built in Object.assign function and TypeScript&#x27;s generic capabilities to only write one such function fo…</span>

...Arthur C. Clarke
This article is part of what I call the magical directives series. In this series, we will unravel the mystery behind some interesting Angular directives. Afterwards, we can add this little magic to our tool box. I call them magical directives because they play a very important role in building reusable components across our Angular applications.
Below are the directives that we will be looking at in this series.
ng-template
ng-container
ng-content
*ngTemplateOutlet
The ng-template directive simply represent an Angular template. Angular uses the ng-template under the hood in our structural directives( *ngIf, *ngFor) and ngSwitch. The ngSwitch controls the structural directives (*ngSwitchCase and *ngSwitchDefault ) and …</span>

We want to make our applications as safe as possible, so we implement a content security policy(CSP) to mitigate Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks or Click Jacking.
The demo application contains an ngx-bootstrap toggle and a Angular Material slider component.

Let&#x27;s implement a CSP header. More information about CSP.


The result is that our application doesn&#x27;t look the same anymore.

Due to our CSP policy, the browser blocks all inline styling that comes from an untrusted source.

Angular Material and ngx-bootstrap styles are added with the styleUrls property. Angular will parse the component&#x27;s styling and add them to the 
 of the page. Based on the ViewEncapsulation proper…</span>

                    <span>Scenario
You are using nginx and trying to call the downstream application but it returns http 502.
Cause
The reason could be because SELINUX would have blocked certain port. You can check the logs for more details.
Steps
The following example is from a sample repo whereby the downstream application uses port 801 and 802.
1) Check the ngnix logs — /var/log/ngnix/error.log
From here you will be able to see the error “permission denied”

2) Check the audit log — /var/log/audit/audit.log
Command:
sudo cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep nginx | grep denied


3) Check the ports that are allowed.
Command:
semange port -l | grep http


4) You can allow them for testing if it’s a legit request. 
Command:
semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 801</span>

                    <span>In my first post on this subject, I demonstrated how to develop a simple console app on windows and get it running on Linux with unit tests.  In this post I will expand on the previous post and show how Linux-specific and Windows-specific code can be developed and unit tested.  In addition I will take a look at xUnit test fixtures, Windows ACLs and Linux file permissions.
As in the last post, the approach is to develop code on Windows and test in Linux containers.  So on your windows dev box the set up you need is Hyper-V and Docker. 

Also needed are the dotnet CLI and VS Code for this optimum (in my view) setup.

All the code for this tutorial can be found at https://github.com/bobrundle/dotnettolinux2

                    <span>Problem:
If Apache DocumentRoot is not the default /var/www/html, it could be a NFS/EFS share. 


Then you might encounter “Permission denied for Apache HTTPD” error when accessing the site.



Solution:
Check your DocumentRoot setting to confirm it is not the default by running below command.




grep -i ‘DocumentRoot’ /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

In output, you might see the DocumentRoot location as “/data/docs/demo” (this is a NFS share)


By default NFS share access will be denied. This can be confirmed by running below command.




getsebool -a | grep httpd_use_nfs

It will give result “httpd_use_nfs → off”


To enable it, run the command,




sudo setsebool -P httpd_use_nfs 1

You can see now &quot;httpd_use_nfs →.on&quot;</span>

                    <span>Serverless deployment is becoming easier and easier every year, but there will always be a subset of use cases that require a persistent, running server.
Projects with stricter requirements around performance, computation, storage, concurrency, and isolation may opt for a more traditional deployment strategy and host a Linux server.
In this tutorial we will deploy a Node.js application on Digital Ocean with PM2.
Create a Node.js app
Configure Node.js app for PM2
Deploy Linux server on Digital Ocean droplet
Setup SSH keys
Install Node.js, Git, and PM2
We will generate a simple Node.js application.

Reinstalling your favorite operating system or changing to another one, accidentally removing a partition from the hard disk, taking a wrong step while working in a partition manager utility, hardware issues, bad blocks – these are only a few things that may cause partitions to become unreadable. The main cause behind partition loss is logical errors in partition tables.
A partition table is a special system file containing settings that contain information about the hard disk drive’s partitions, including the beginning and the end of the disk, the file system, the name, size and many other …</span>

                    <span>We made it so we can catch bad guys that try to access our Admin site, but not how about we make so that all of our site form able to catch the bad guy? Sound like a cool proposal right.
Usually, attacker will use a bot to try and crack our web app. One solution is to also include a honeypot everywhere there is a form. This will not deter all of the bot but adding that extra layer of security will not hurt right. Honestly, so far we made it so that we have incremental security measure in place. 
I think this is where I should say that, in security terms, there is nothing that is truly secure but we need to just slowdown the attack as much as we can to the point it doesn&#x27;t make any sense for the attacker to continue. 
pipenv install django-honeypot
pipenv lock -r &gt; requirements.txt

INSTALLED_APPS &#x3D; [
    #...

    # django-honeypot
    &#x27;honeypot&#x27;,
    #...
]

if you want to activate the honeypot web app wide, the easiest way was to use a middleware provided by django-honeypot
MIDDLEWARE &#x3D; [
    #...

    # Django-honeypot
    # https://pypi.org/project/django-honeypot/
    &#x27;honeypot.middleware.HoneypotMiddleware&#x27;,

lastly add this variable to your settings.py file

HONEYPOT_FIELD_NAME &#x3D; &quot;secret_key&quot;

As of right now I feel that we made our web app a bit safer. I&#x27;m not gonna say that our code is safe from any bot attack but at least the normal to medium type bot.</span>

We want to make our applications as safe as possible, so we implement a content security policy(CSP) to mitigate Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks or Click Jacking.
The demo application contains an ngx-bootstrap toggle and a Angular Material slider component.

Let&#x27;s implement a CSP header. More information about CSP.


The result is that our application doesn&#x27;t look the same anymore.

Due to our CSP policy, the browser blocks all inline styling that comes from an untrusted source.

Angular Material and ngx-bootstrap styles are added with the styleUrls property. Angular will parse the component&#x27;s styling and add them to the 
 of the page. Based on the ViewEncapsulation proper…</span>

                    <span>Arguably version control is among the biggest innovations in software engineering. 
Version control or revision control as it is called gives an immense power to the developers while developing the complex systems. Version control allows developers to keep the working pieces of the system available. Specifically version control allows critical capabilities such as reproducibility, traceability. 
Reproducibility is like a magical wand which helps to create identical systems no matter how complex the system itself is. 
Traceability helps developers to pick up any environment and track its dependencies. Traceability also helps to pick up any two versions of the environment and find out differences, if any. 
Advantages offered by reproducibility and traceability are already well understood by …</span>

...Arthur C. Clarke
This article is part of what I call the magical directives series. In this series, we will unravel the mystery behind some interesting Angular directives. Afterwards, we can add this little magic to our tool box. I call them magical directives because they play a very important role in building reusable components across our Angular applications.
Below are the directives that we will be looking at in this series.
ng-template
ng-container
ng-content
*ngTemplateOutlet
The ng-template directive simply represent an Angular template. Angular uses the ng-template under the hood in our structural directives( *ngIf, *ngFor) and ngSwitch. The ngSwitch controls the structural directives (*ngSwitchCase and *ngSwitchDefault ) and …</span>

                    <span>What We’re Building


Previously, I had used AWS SAM to build a CRUD app for notes. Recently, I wanted to learn more about the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), GraphQL, and AWS AppSync, so I decided to refactor my original project.
Disclaimer that at the time of writing the CDK v2 is in developer preview. This blog post will use CDK v1.
If you want to skip ahead, take a look the finished project here.
If this is your first time using the CDK, bootstrap your AWS account. The Prerequisites section in this guide has the steps.
Start by installing the CDK npm package and running the cdk init command. This is helpful because it gives you a directory structure along with a very minimal stack to get started.
On top of the initial scaffolding in /lib/note-service-stack.ts let’s add some extra impo…</span>

                    <span>Hey peeps!



  
  
  The following is a blog on core types in typescript that are not there in JavaScript for beautiful devs. You should have  a proper knowledge of &#x27;vanilla&#x27; JavaScript.



  
  
  The following are the steps to setup the dev environment {


• install node 
to compile the file and automatically you should have a JavaScript file created 
• enables you to add multiple values in one variable


• allows you to add multiple core types


 • enum helps you delaring set of named constants


}


  
  
  Nice!



  
  
  Now you know all the core types!



  
  
  So yeah that&#x27;s it for now!</span>

I am assuming you have some basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
We will write a very simple HTML code to display the paragraph content and a copy button.

                    <span>How to create a super simple accordion component in Angular. Using the power of content projection in Angular, we are going to build an accordion/expansion panel that can be customized in multiple ways.
Accordions in general are vertically stacked lists of headers when clicked reveals some content. Accordions or expandable sections are seen as part of almost all the UI libraries out there.
If we take a look at Angular material, we have Expansion Panel (ref) and in Ng Bootstrap its called simple Accordion (ref).
What we are gonna build is a much simpler version of these. And as always, the whole idea behind this is to help you explore some possibilities of Angular. This blog post would be mostly about how we can use Content Projection (ref) in Angular to create reusable and customizable UI …</span>

I find all the JS UI frameworks confusing. There are so many of them, each has its own syntax and structure, many components, and doesn&#x27;t use &quot;traditional&quot; JS/TS, but many placeholders that get &quot;replaced&quot; later on. I reached this conclusion recently when I started a new project (with a new company) and the UI part was done purely in Angular and the UI communicated with the BE using REST calls. The project had less than a month since it started, so I wasn&#x27;t quite from the start so I could not impose my view :D

                    <span>Hello Developers 🤩🤩🤩


Let&#x27;s admit it typing effect looks cool and the good news is we can achieve it without any pain 😜.
    npm install typed.js
    or
    yarn add typed.js
    or
    bower install typed.js

Let&#x27;s dive into the code.





import Typed from &quot;typed.js&quot;;
import { useEffect, useRef } from &quot;react&quot;;

export default function App() {
  // Create Ref element.
  const el &#x3D; useRef(null);

  useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
    const typed &#x3D; new Typed(el.current, {
      strings: [&quot;Handy&quot;, &quot;Mandy&quot;, &quot;Candy&quot;, &quot;More Strings&quot;], // Strings to display
      // Speed settings, try diffrent values untill you get good results
      startDelay: 300,
      typeSpeed: 100,
      backSpeed: 100,
      backDelay: 100
    });

    // Destropying
    return () &#x3D;&gt; {
      typed.destroy();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    
Hello Developers

    
 {
    const typed &#x3D; new Typed(el.current, {
      strings: [&quot;Handy&quot;, &quot;Mandy&quot;, &quot;Candy&quot;, &quot;More Strings&quot;], // Strings to display
      // Speed settings, try diffrent values untill you get good results
      startDelay: 300,
      typeSpeed: 100,

      smartBackspace: true,
      loop: true,
      showCursor: true,
      cursorChar: &quot;!&quot;
    });

    // Destropying
    return () &#x3D;&gt; {

For TypeScript lovers it provide types by default.

&quot;child_process&quot; has four kind of methods(exclude &quot;Sync&quot; mehtods).
exec
execFile
fork
spawn
Because I wanted to know how to use them properly, I will try them.
Node.js ver.16.3.0
ts-node ver.10.0.0
TypeScript ver.4.3.2
According to the documents, they are based on &quot;child_process.spawn()&quot;.
import { exec, execFile, fork, spawn } from &quot;child_process&quot;;
import path, { resolve } from &quot;path/posix&quot;;

function start() {

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>
