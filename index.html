As Front End developer who worked in Forune 500 companies such as Raymond James financial advisory company and SwissRe leading insurance broker, in this blog we gonna discuss some famous misconceptions among non- Angular developers. This blog should be unbiased and focused on facts only.
Myth #1: Steep Learning Curve in Angular

One of the famous misleading opinions we observe among people especially on Twitter and youtube gurus is ‘Angular has a steep learning curve’. The short answer is yes, Angular has not a small road to learning and master. But let’s first analyze the definition of this concept. A steep learning curve refers to: ‘The amount of time required to learn is big’. Interesting but what ma…</span>

                    <span>This is one of the strange problems of VirtualBox which drives me crazy until I figured out how simple a solution it was.
If you are running from the same problem, don&#x27;t worry. Just make sure you are using the right installer for your distribution/OS
By the way, Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6 (&gt;&#x3D;2.28) or libc6 (&gt;&#x3D;2.29) is referred to as the same problem
OK, Let me explain a bit further,  A few months ago I was wanted to install VirtualBox on my Linux Mint computer, So, I went to the VirtualBox Official website (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads) but I won&#x27;t found the installer for Linux Mint Version ( It&#x27;s still not present here as you can see in the picture below)

So, I downloaded  Ubuntu 19.10 / 20.04 / 20.10 / 21.04 version because I knew Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu. so, whatever works on Ubuntu should be work on Linux Mint as well. It was not a big deal. But it won&#x27;t worked and threw this Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6 (&gt;&#x3D;2.28) error.

At that moment I reconsider my OS. I was using Linux Mint 19.3 Cinnamon. OS version placed a critical role here. I simply Googled &quot;Linux Mint 19.3 Ubuntu Version&quot;  and found Mint 19.3 is based on Ubuntu 18.04 . 
I revisit the download page and download it again but now from the  Ubuntu 18.04 / 18.10 / 19.04  option and run the installer and Guess what, It was running absolutely fine without any issue. Through the installer required some extra dependency, not an issue, just allowed it

Maybe you downloaded the Debian 10 version installer, not working.. then download it for Debian 9. Fedora 33/34 not working... download it for Fedora 32. Just make sure that the VirtualBox installer is compatible with your OS version :)

                    <span>I wanted a way to make it easier to generate C# XML code comments for properties for Visual Studio Code (&quot;VSCode&quot;). Working with doc comments in VSCode is painful.
There is no ghost-doc extension equivelant for C# in VSCode.
The closest extension for generating comments is the docomment extension which is being replaced by omnisharp functionality.
If you run analyzers for code documentation; constructors, properties, and other public code fragments require specific phrases and required XML elements.
On windows, you can fall back to Visual Studio.  If you&#x27;re running your dev-environment on Linux, using Visual Studio isn&#x27;t an option.
Visual Studio Code has documentation for user-defined code snippets.
I found a post on how to split camel-cased words into lower-cased fragments on stack overflow
Using the above, I was able to cobble together the snippets below.
{ 
    &quot;prop&quot;: {
        &quot;prefix&quot;: &quot;prop&quot;,
        &quot;body&quot;: [
            &quot;/// Gets or sets the ${2/([A-Z][a-z]+$)|([A-Z][a-z]+)/${1:/downcase}${2:/downcase}${2:+ }/g}&quot;,
            &quot;/// Property ${2:property} represents ${3:description}.&quot;,
            &quot;public ${1:type} ${2:Property} { get; set; }&quot;
        ]
    },
    &quot;ctor-summary&quot;: {
        &quot;prefix&quot;: &quot;ctor-summary&quot;,
        &quot;body&quot;: [
            &quot;Initializes a new instance of the  class.&quot;
        ]
    },
}

Learning that I got while installing Arch Linux.

  fdisk andcfdisk
  mbr vs gpt drives
  useful commands
Please, note this: If you are looking for a tutorial to help into the installation process, go with the official docs of ArchWiki. And, if needs a help feel free to call me on Twitter or on my discord.
Let’s go
I made an upgrade on my computer and add a new SSD to be dedicated only to Linux. Since I was going to have to format the current HD with a partition for Ubuntu 20.04, I soon decided to migrate to Arch Linux.
Arch is a more robust version that brings in its installation the minimum necessary to run the system in a terminal. At the end of the installation process if you want a GUI you can choose one of your own and move on.

In computer science there’s the concept of queues. Queue is the set of messages that are meant to be delivered from one sender to one or more receivers. The messages can be delivered in order or out of order by design. The computer program that handles these transactions is called message broker. RabbitMQ is one the most popular message brokers that runs on top of Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). There are four main components forming AMQP protocol: Publisher, Exchange, Queue, Consumer.
Messages are Published to an exchange by a publisher, Publisher also is responsible for setting the attributes of the message which we will cover later.

This tutorial will show you how to install the AWS CDK on Ubuntu and deploy your first JavaScript Infrastructure as Code (IAS) to AWS. 
Warning: I do not assume any responsibility if you incur any charges. You are responsible for managing your resources in your AWS account. 
If you find yourself stuck, I recommend reviewing the AWS documentation to find detailed concepts, definitions, and critical terminology to help you along the way. 
&quot;AWS CDK is a software development framework for defining cloud infrastructure in code and provisioning it through AWS CloudFormation.
You use the CDK to define your cloud resources in a familiar programming language. The CDK supports TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#/.Net, and (in developer preview) Go.&quot; - AWS Docs.

                    <span>Comecei a trabalhar quando fiz quatorze anos de idade, estava no segundo ano do ensino médio e tinha acabado de conseguir meu primeiro emprego, que foi em telemarketing, um início comum para jovens brasileiros.
Muita coisa se passou desde aquele início, meses depois troquei de emprego e fui trabalhar num banco. Com dezessete entrei na faculdade de Engenharia de Produção e desde então quatorze anos se passaram, trabalho todo esse período no setor administrativo e financeiro.
E mesmo tendo alcançado um bom cargo, um relativo bom salário, nesses quatorze anos de experiência profissional, tenho periódicas crises existenciais, com a grande questão que me cerca:

E com meus, atuais, vinte oito anos decidi aprender uma nova profissão, algo que unisse alguns elementos que eu gosto, e no fim optei por aprender a de Desenvolvedor Front-End.
Feliz em poder compartilhar o início dessa jornada aqui nessa comunidade, mesmo não tendo certeza se é pra isso que ela existe. 
Mas agora, estudando, acho melhor começar a chamar início de begin, ou start ou qualquer outro termo inglês, porquê combina mais com esse mundo.</span>

                    <span>since you landed here you definitely want to know what docker is?
We&#x27;ll start off by telling the problem statement: let&#x27;s say we want to use create-react-app where the OS is not compatible of node to install npm install -g create-react-app 😿 , you can achieve this by using Docker Image. Hurray!!!! Interesting. isn&#x27;t it? 🤔
WHAT is docker? simply you can think off like a Sea Port harbour docker 🚢 where we have containers to be exported into other places across the world and container contains the goods and materials. Similarly, our docker also has containers but here we call those goods and materials as an Image, just a technical term. so all the images need a place to store we call it Docker Hub. just like a GitHub is the place to store code as simple as that.
Now, How does docker solve …</span>

                    <span>How do you construct a boxpot with ease using R



  
  
  How to plot Boxplot in R-programming


box plot also is very similar to all others graphs in method. All we need to draw it is our data then the box plot() function.
Represent the following  weight of some students in boxpot.
Codes
weight&#x3D;c(1,3, 6, 1,3,3, 4, 3, 3, 1, 3 ,5 ,1, 2, 1 ,4, 3, 2 ,3 ,1 ,1, 1 ,1, 4, 3, 1,5,5)
boxplot(weight)

Result&gt;&gt;


Now that is nice, how about given it color and title?? then we can make use of some other parameters in boxplot() function. they are :
main: to write the main title of the graph
col: to give preferable colour for our boxpot.
col.main : to give a preferable font color of our main title
xlab: to give a label on x axis
use the weights in example to plot boxplot.
weight&#x3D;c(1,3, 6, 1,3,3, 4, 3, 3, 1, 3 ,5 ,1, 2,
         1 ,4, 3, 2 ,3 ,1 ,1, 1 ,1, 4, 3, 1,5,5)
boxplot(weight,
        ylab &#x3D; &quot;numbers&quot;,
        main &#x3D; &quot;The weight of some students.&quot;,
        col &#x3D; &quot;darkorange&quot;,
        col.main&#x3D;&#x27;red&#x27;,border&#x3D;&#x27;green&#x27;)

Result&gt;&gt;

One more thing is that you can have more than one boxplot on your graph, just list them in the boxplot() function.  
Example
Mathematics&#x3D;c(61,53, 46, 61,63,53, 44, 43, 43, 61, 33 ,45 ,31, 52,    51 ,54, 53, 44 ,38 ,51 ,41, 51 ,61, 44, 53, 61,45,55)
English &#x3D; c(51,43, 66, 51,43,33, 44, 53, 63, 41, 53, 45 ,51, 52,
         61 ,44, 33, 42 ,53 ,61 ,61, 51 ,41, 44, 43, 41,45,45)
boxplot(Mathematics,English
        ylab &#x3D; &quot;numbers&quot;,
        main &#x3D; &quot;The Mathematics and English Score of some students.&quot;,
        col &#x3D; &quot;orange&quot;,
        col.main&#x3D;&#x27;red&#x27;,border&#x3D;&#x27;blue&#x27;)

Result&gt;&gt;

                    <span>Understanding Kubernetes can be difficult or time-consuming. In order to spread knowledges about Cloud technologies I started to create sketchnotes about Kubernetes, then I&#x27;ve auto-published a book and since now I&#x27;ve started a new serie of video! :-)
I imagined a serie of short videos with a mix of sketchnotes and speech.
I think it could be a good way, more visual, with audio &amp; video to explain Kubernetes (and others technologies).
This episode is focused on Deployment Rolling Update.




The video is in French BUT I done the subtitles in english (and french too).
If you liked the video and are interested to watch another ones, please give me some feedbacks (and you can also subscribe to my Youtube channel, if you want to ❤️).
If you are interested, I published all the sketchnotes on Kubernetes (and new ones!) to make a &quot;book&quot; of 165 pages: &quot;Understanding Kubernetes in a visual way&quot;.
If you like theses sketchnotes, you can follow me, I will publish others sketchs shortly :-).</span>

                    <span>As React is a single page application that runs as static page inside a browser runtime environment, there is nothing like a runtime variable. However, there are few hacks through which we can implement dynamic variables in a React application.
But the question is why we need a runtime variable for static page? Well, in my experience there are few cases which compel us to look for runtime or dynamic variable in a React app or for that matter of fact any SPA. For example, different API endpoints for local, pre-prod, and production, different API keys for pre-prod and prod, and likewise.
An environment file
A Bash script
A NPM script 
Include script tag in public/index.html
Script where runtime variable is needed

Due to the popularity of Unix and Linux systems, vim has been ported to most operating systems which means that, with minimal effort, you can run vim on your own computer.

Learning vim is not something you can do overnight and you will only become efficient if you practice for some time.

1. Manage your hard drive
In order to get anything done with your computer, you will need to manage your hard drive. Using commands in your terminal, you can easily perform tasks like creating, moving, copying and deleting files. 
It&#x27;s important to note that these commands can be destructive, so any rm command you perform with them will remove data from your computer

                    <span>The world is going Linux. At least that&#x27;s what we tell ourselves every time we open a terminal window and type in a cryptic series of characters that do nothing but make us more frustrated than we were when we started. If you&#x27;ve ever considered using Linux, but aren&#x27;t sure where to start, this guide is for you.
The command line might seem intimidating at first, but it&#x27;s actually not so bad. You can use the GUI (Graphical User Interface) if you want, but the terminal has a lot of cool features that make using Linux much easier.
If you&#x27;re on Ubuntu and want to see what commands you have available, just hit the CTRL+ALT+T key combination and a box will appear in the top left corner showing you all the different programs available. 

Linux commands are essentially small bundles of text designed to perform a specific task, such as move files from one location to another or run a program.
The Linux command line is not intimidating once you learn a few basic commands. The following are some of the most common commands and cover a wide range of tasks you might want to do.
The cd command stands for &quot;change directory&quot; and it changes the current working directory on your computer. It&#x27;s very useful for navigating around your filesystem.
For example, if you&#x27;re in your home directory and want to get to /etc/hosts, you could type:
cd /etc/hosts

You could also do this if you&#x27;re already in /etc/hosts but want to go back up one directory:
cd ..

If you want to see what&#x27;s in your current working directory, use the ls command like this: ls.
ls

This will list all of the files and directories in the current working directory.
There are many other commands that accomplish the same tasks for some commands, such as cp (copy) and mv (move).
cp file /home/user/Desktop/

There&#x27;s a lot more to learn, but the commands in this article will serve you well no matter which Linux distro you&#x27;re using. They even work on Mac OS X and on the BSD systems.
If you are new to the command line, I recommend this site</span>

I wanted to do a walkthrough and explanation of the dynamic matrix generator I built to build analytic timelines on matrix function execution. This was the beginning of a project I ultimately went to Kotlin to do. This is a loop-less, dynamic and single threaded process. It utilizes a subroutine pattern on instantiation and bring in the &quot;out&quot; variable concept to the object manipulation. Past this, it will be a lot of annotated code. Its Open-Source and MIT licensed. Copypasta at will. I&#x27;d be flattered.

                    <span>Today I want to show you how to import functions from *.mjs files. You can think of MJS as JavaScript code that is exported in a standardized module format. It&#x27;s basically (M)odular (J)ava(S)cript. The standardization itself is called ECMAScript Modules (ESM).
By default, the Node.js platform doesn&#x27;t use ES modules but CommonJS, which is a different module formatting system. Fortunately, the Node.js team introduced the concept of ES modules back in 2017 with Node v8.9.0. At that time, you could run Node.js with an additional flag (--experimental-modules) to make use of it.
Since Node v13.2.0 the experimental flag is no longer required. It only takes a few steps now to use an ECMAScript module. Let me show you how to do it.

There are two basic ways to interact with DynamoDB tables from Node.js applications:
Class AWS.DynamoDB from AWS SDK for JavaScript/Typescript
AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient which simplifies working with DynamoDB items by abstracting away DynamoDB Types and converting responses to native JS
This cheat sheet will mostly focus on DocumentClient but some of the operations like creating tables must be run using classical DynamoDB service.

                    <span>Notion API is finally here, and it&#x27;s so cool. But you must be wondering what is Notion in the first case? Well, it&#x27;s a powerful productivity tool for managing your daily day-to-day tasks, or maybe jotting down a lot of ideas you want to put up in your next blog? There are unlimited possibilities. 
I myself found it annoying at first because I have a habit of writing down things instead of typing them out on a notepad. But turns out, it did boost my productivity moreover, it&#x27;s much more noticeable when you are working with a team.
Now imagine if you could display all these data to a front-end, and update them directly on the Notion database instead of pushing some extra line of code. Your favorite tool now has its own API!
This tutorial is beginner-friendly, so don&#x27;t hesitate. I assure you,…</span>

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.
First, run the development server:
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.
The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

  Intro 


Continuing on from my previous blog about website security week, we&#x27;re going to talk about a validation.
If accept user input, you are going to need to validate the input. Non validated user inputs can lead to security vulnerabilities for example SQL injection attacks, where user input escapes your database and starts modifying it. It can also lead to exceptions from your code if a user inputs text rather than a number for example.
Please Please Please ensure you do the same validation server side as you do on the frontend (client) side.



You user inputs should be contained in HTML forms which comes with lots of powerful validation tools built in.
First thing to check on your inputs is, are you using the correc…</span>

Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a digital system for recording the transaction of assets in which the transactions and their details are recorded in multiple places at the same time. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have no central data store or administration functionality.
Instead, a distributed network of nodes maintains a public record of all transactions between them. In a blockchain, transactions are made on a record called a &quot;block&quot; that is updated by the distributed public ledger</span>

We are going to use the keyboard module for the keylogger.  To install it, open your terminal type in pip install keyboard. If no error occured, you are good to go.
After that, open a new python file and let&#x27;s start coding 🕶️
import keyboard #The keyboard module

def logger(event):
    print(event.name)

keyboard.on_press(logger)
keyboard.wait()

I can say we are done, maybe above 50% done. Let me explain the code; on the first line, we imported the keyboard module. Then we defined our logger(event) function, it takes event as parameter and then it print&#x27;s it&#x27;s .name out. Then to the next line, we assigned the logger function as a parameter t…</span>

However, it allows you to create private endpoints to secure the traffic between resources in your virtual network and Azure SignalR Service.

This cheat sheet should help you how to perform variefy of operations starting from simple queries ending with complex transactions using AWS DynamoDB DocumentClient and Node.js.
There are two basic ways to interact with DynamoDB tables from Node.js applications:
Class AWS.DynamoDB from AWS SDK for JavaScript/Typescript
AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient which simplifies working with DynamoDB items by abstracting away DynamoDB Types and converting responses to native JS
This cheat sheet will mostly focus on DocumentClient but some of the operations like creating tables must be run using classical DynamoDB service.

Routing determines how an application responds to a request for particular endpoint. 
For an introduction to routing, please see Express docs
When a server manages multiple objects it results in serving multiple endpoints. At this point,  it would become harder to main the application logic at one place. Express helps us divide the application logic based on objects it serves into individual routes. 
We will demonstrate a simple example of routing on a node server
You can skip to tutorial and refer to this commit for source code
This post assumes users have the knowledge of basic express server. If you are not familiar with it please refer to demo example


We will be using postman to test our end points

                    <span>A Complete Zero-to-Hero guide in setting up a CI/CD Pipeline using Gitlab-CI to deploy with the help of Azure Storage



For the purpose of this demo, I have already created a simple Angular 7 application that is hosted on Gitlab, the application is a simple, digital clock that looks something like this.


The above diagram describes the whole process, right from a developer pushing the code, to the point where the CI/CD Pipeline builds &amp; deploys the code to Azure Storage (Blob) which is linked to Azure CDN Endpoint.
Developer goes ahead and performs the development locally of the application after which he goes ahead and commits and pushes the code to the version control system in our case it’s Gitlab.


We would then have Gitlab perform the CI/CD in the form of the steps mentioned in git…</span>

                    <span>Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.
Vim is often used by programmers on Linux. But it can be used on Mac OS X and Windows too.

Vim is a powerful text editor that runs in a terminal, yet can be used to edit any kind of file. It&#x27;s old, it&#x27;s weird, and it&#x27;s hard to learn but also one of the most powerful tools for editing code on any operating system.
So what about commands?
Here&#x27;s a handy cheat sheet to help you get started with the editor. 



Cursor Movement





h
move cursor left


j
move cursor down


k
move cursor up


l
move cursor right


w
jump forwards to the start of a word


b
jump backwards to the start of a word



To write and to use commands press ESC for command mode or i for insert mode.
To save, open and quit a file:



Basic editor commands





:e filename
edit a file in a new buffer


:w
write (save) the file, but don&#x27;t exit


:wq
write (save) and quit


:x
write (save) and quit


:q
quit (fails if there are unsaved changes)


:q!
quit and throw away unsaved changes


:qa
quit all buffers and windows


ZZ
write (save) current file, if modified, and quit


ZQ
quit without checking for changes



You can copy and paste text too:



Cut and Paste





yy
yank (copy) a line


2yy
yank (copy) 2 lines


p
put (paste) the clipboard after cursor


P
put (paste) before cursor


dd
delete (cut) a line


2dd
delete (cut) 2 lines



There are quite a few commands you have to memorize to use Vim effectively, which can be overwhelming when you’re learning. 
You can use these exercises to memorize commands.</span>

                    <span>Bash is a Unix shell used in Linux and MacOS. We will be using a bash script to make a program that runs in the background. 
You need to know how to open a terminal in your operating system. On Ubuntu, you can press Ctrl+Alt+t . On Mac, you can press Command+Space, then type Terminal and press Enter.
To make bash scripts, you should know Linux commands. To practice the command line, you can use this site
A Bash script is a text file containing a series of Bash commands. When the file is executed, the commands are executed in sequence as they appear in the text file.
To get started, you can create a new script called my_script.sh. 
A simple script would be:
echo &quot;Hello World&quot;

Make it executable with the command:
chmod +x my_script.sh

This script will run when you enter the following comma…</span>

                    <span>Vim and emacs are two of the most popular text editors in the world. They are very different, with a different design philosophy.
Vim and Emacs are still used to this day and are both great choices 😁
Vim&#x27;s main advantage is that it is very good at being a text editor and that you can do a lot without having to learn anything new.
You can install plugins, change key mappings, etc. either with the builtin scripting language or by sourcing scripts from your .vimrc .
Emacs is a text editor but more than that. It can be used for email, browsing the internet and a lot more.
Vim is a modal editor. It operates in either the insert mode (where keystrokes are entered and text is composed) or the command mode (where text can be moved and modified). 
It is not until you exit command mode and return t…</span>

                    <span>gpg is a program to encrypt and decrypt files. In other words, it is a program for privacy and security.
Your data is safe if you store it on gpg (i.e. encrypted).
So why would you expose your secret information to the threat of being stolen by leaking it to a computer disk?
The only reason is ignorance, because encryption is easy and saves you effort and money in the long run.
Tools like gpg make encryption as easy as saving a file, or even easier.
gpg linux will help you encrypt your e-mails or to encrypt files on your disk so that nobody else can read them without knowing the decryption password which you alone know.

Here is a short explanation, but be aware these are generic names inspired by old western movies!
Hackers are of all kinds, genders, and ages. Forget about the hoodie, the darkroom, and the need for recognition. Not that the cliché never happens, but remember it&#x27;s a stereotype.
Anyway, not all hackers are cybercriminals. White hats or &quot;ethical hackers&quot; use their skills to test and ultimately improve security for various organizations and people. For example, banks and medical services can be involved.
They use the same techniques as gray and black hats to infiltrate systems. Black hats are known for their dark intentions. I would describe gray hats as &quot;not always ethical hackers.&quot; Sometimes, they do illegal stuff.

However, with this comes the need to add some form of authentication in front of all your services. For example, you probably don&#x27;t want just anyone to be able to view all your RSS feeds, or use your markdown editor freely!
The most basic form is HTTP Basic Authentication, which is a pain as it must be configured and re-entered for each subdomain/service. You also need to type it out for each service, which can be challenging on mobile.
Single Sign On (SSO) on the other hand allows you to authenticate with different services with a single login. For example, if you have a Google account, you can go to youtube.com, gmail.co…</span>

If you want to protect communication between the client and the server from eavesdroppers then HTTPS is the way to go because if anyone tries to listen to your communication it will be just random characters to them as HTTPS makes all the calls encrypted. Also browsers nowadays enforce all the sites to be secured and you can notice a padlock icon beside the URL, whereas websites which doesn&#x27;t have a padlock icon beside the URL are flagged as not secured and a warning is displayed before you can continue to browse.

                    <span>This post showcases a quick and easy way to make a Firebase-authenticated user available throughout your React web app.
We are using here plain React with Typescript, and no extra state management library like Redux involved.
Firebase offers us to register a callback that gets called every time a user is authenticated or signed out to get notified about the current authentication situation.
import firebase from &quot;firebase/app&quot;;

firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (user) {
    console.log(&quot;authenticated&quot;, user);
  } else {
    console.log(&quot;signed out&quot;);
  }
});

We thus could implement a React component that is interested in the authenticated user quite straightforward like this:
import * as React from &quot;react&quot;;
import firebase from &quot;firebase/app&quot;;

function CurrentUser() {

                    <span>This blog post originally posted on my blog site and you can find it here.


From last post, we stopped with a bug that introduce to the system. If we check the console in API we can see there is an error.
error: bind message supplies 2 parameters, but prepared statement &quot;&quot; requires 1


The thing is, in the post resolver, we are providing 2 parameters in the replacement array. But in the query, we only have $1. Because if the user just scroll the home page without login to the system, there will not be an UserId . So we need to change the parameters dynamically according to the query.
So first change the replacement array.
const replacement: any[] &#x3D; [realLimitPlusOne];

Then set the cursor index dynamically.
if (req.session.userId) {
  replacement.push(req.session.userId);
}
let cursorIdx …</span>

                    <span>We&#x27;ve all been there. For some reason we are not really sure what type of object to expect from an API endpoint. Maybe the API has not been defined yet, or whatever. So what do we do?
You&#x27;ve probably seen code like this, because someone knew it was going to be a list of things.
getData(): Observable {
  // return this.http.get(API_URL); // TODO: Integrate with api
  return of([]);
}

But we can do better than that.
You might not know what type of object to expect, but you probably have a vague idea. Maybe it is going to be a list of objects with keys (strings) which you don&#x27;t know yet.
In that case you want to do something like this:

                    <span>With this series I intend to note down some of the confusion and quirky stuff that I encountered out in the wild. So, today I am going to start with this snippet in TypeScript. 
interface CustomState {
  value: {
    [key:string]: any
  }
}

const defaultState : CustomState &#x3D; {
  value: {}
}

const reducer &#x3D; (state: CustomState, action: { type: string }): CustomState &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (action.type &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;reset&#x27;) {
    return {
      value: []
    }
  } else {
    return {
      ...state
    }
  }
}

The CustomState declared at the start includes a property called value, which is an object with key-value pairs of the form string - any. The defaultState variable contains an (empty) object conforming to the interface declared above, which is perfectly normal.

                    <span>I made a library to generate development infrastructure for typescript project.
chore-cli is the super assistant for building a typescript library. It can generate development infrastructure for projects or libraries, such as prettier, eslint, husky etc, or even Github Actions Config files. It can save a lot of time every time you create new stuff.
As we know, These tools like eslint, prettier can make the codebase better. But it takes us a lot of time to configure them. If you don&#x27;t want your enthusiasm for writing code to be consumed by these configurations, and if you don&#x27;t like doing these annoying &quot;chores&quot; frequently, try chore-cli.
It&#x27;s easy to use：
npx chore-cli 


Take a look at the README.md for examples and further documentation, and let me know if you find any bugs, or you have any idea for improving it.</span>

Referrers on the web allow sites you are visiting to see what site you have come from, as the Referer header (it is actually mispelled in the HTTP Specification) contains a absolute or partial url of the site you&#x27;ve come from if you have followed a link.
commonly used for tracking and analytics, but it can also be used to steal information for example that contained in the URL of a reset password page or where a token is part of the URL, which is why it comes under security headers.

                    <span>No, upgrading to Angular 12.x.x will not help.
The Typescript experimental decorators were based on TC39 proposal-decorators.
We use the same Decorators in our Angular codebase to create services, components and other Angular constructs.
But the same TC39 proposal has evolved in a different direction which is semantically not compatible with the experimental Typescript decorators.   
The new spec for Decorators is easier to use and write.
You can find the detailed comparison between old and new decorators here. 
Just finished up the first draft of the new decorators spec, pretty excited about it 😄 https://t.co/ELhZbsiaiR

Does this mean that Typescript experimental decorators will not be compatible with Javascript decorators 😨
— Shivam (@shivamd20

Unfortunately no, the new proposal has differing semantics from previous proposals in a number of ways. TypeScript experimental decorators were also incompatible with the Define semantics class fields, which caused a decent amount of breakage in the ecosystem.

When the proposal advances, figuring out a step-by-step incremental upgrade path for existing decorators users is definitely going to be a priority though! No user left behind 😄

Let&#x27;s just hope that this doesn’t result in fragmentation of JavaScript decorators. We have already faced a lot inconvenience due to commonsjs and ES6 imports.</span>

I wanted to something fun for the holiday season, so I decided to port a variable-width stroke from the Flex Freehand Drawing Library I created back in the early 2010’s. This stroke actually has a venerable history, going back to about 1983, as an exercise I was assigned as a teaching assistant for a graduate course in computational geometry. The instructor’s company recently obtained a very expensive tablet. This system allowed users to scan or load drawings already in electronic form into a display and annotate them with hand-drawn notes using a fixed-width stroke. The instructor had an idea for a variable-width (speed-dependent) stroke that would be the basis for a number of lab exercises. My job was to get his idea working in Fortran (yes, now you ca…</span>

                    <span>⌨️ Improve the User Experience (UX) of an e-commerce application by implementing animations utilizing Angular animations, CSS animations, and Web Animation APIs.



  
  
  
Developers can use animations in meaningful and non-distracting ways to significantly improve their application&#x27;s user experience (UX). This blog post discusses four effective techniques to animate your application&#x27;s user interface, covering popular use cases. You&#x27;ll learn how to transform bland experiences into memorable ones for your users.
I created a demo application to help you focus on adding animations to Angular. You&#x27;ll add animations to a starter app as you progress through this tutorial. The starter application uses Tailwind to take care of its style and layout, but none of the animations discussed here are dependent on it.
Follow this tutorial without cloning any repo, right in the browser using Stackblitz or CodeSandbox.
If you prefer to work locally in your IDE, clone the demo app and check out its starter branch:
git clone -b starter git@github.com:auth0-blog/angular-animations-storefront.git

Once you clone the repo, make angular-animations-storefront your current directory:
cd angular-animations-storefront

Install the project&#x27;s dependencies:
npm i

Run the project locally:
npm run start

Angular comes with a powerful animation module that lets you quickly add motion to your application: BrowserAnimationsModule. Under the hood, this module uses the Web Animations API (WAAPI) to create motion and interactivity. Whenever WAAPI isn&#x27;t available, BrowserAnimationsModule falls back to using CSS keyframes. Angular animations give you the option to use their abstraction layer to animate any properties that the web considers animatable such as positions, sizes, colors, and many more.

Taking Mark&#x27;s instruction a bit further; to achieve drag&amp;drop in a bit more realistic situation, calling the store in a service asynchronously. To achieve this status, I stumbled on the .valueChanges(...) method.
The internal firestore documents explains the working of this .valueChanges(...) method as it listen to all documents in the retrieved collection and queries this list as an Observable. 
idField. When the idField option is provided like 
.valueChanges({idField: &#x27;&lt;a-property-of-the-document&#x27;}) it means that the document ID (actually the document&#x27;s name) will be mapped to the provided property being one of the properties within the document-object.
Know the construction of the document, in this case document (ITask) &#x3D; { id?: string; title?:string; description?: string&#x27;; }. 

When calling the .valueChanges(...) method with a provided idField, which is set to one of the provided properties as stated, internally, the ID (actually the document&#x27;s name) of that document is mapped to the &#x27;provided&#x27;-property within the document object.

                    <span>Last month I setup my blog with Angular Universal (Server Side Render) this is about my steps installing SSR in my blog, so keep in mind a simple blog with only text with http request to contentful, so is real scenario, but the simple case to get start with Angular and Server Side render.
First step install Angular universal.
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine@next

Next step was set up the build in netlify
npm run build:ssr

The page is ready with server side render, but my client application need to request the articles, The TransferState service help to send information from the server to the client.
  imports: [
    BlogHeaderModule,
    BrowserModule,
    InfrastructureModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    BrowserModule.withServerTransition({ appId: &#x27;dw&#x27; }),
    TransferHttpCacheModule
  ],

Install it as part of the App module and import into  ServerTransferStateModule in server module.
@NgModule({
  imports: [AppModule, ServerModule, ServerTransferStateModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})

Done
Because my app is only text was easy to get more than 95% but keep in mind the following points.
Not all application are the same, my case is a simple blog, so not issues with images, or authentication.
Use https://contrastchecker.com/ and https://alex-page.github.io/sass-a11ycolor for accesibility issues.
If is your first time, try with an easy proyect like a blog or small app.
Take care about how to use or transfer data between components, I got an issue to send data using this.location.getState().
Done!</span>

                    <span>A user is usually authenticated by entering a username, email address, and/or password and then being given access to various resources or services. By its very existence, authentication relies on maintaining the user&#x27;s state. This seems to go against HTTP&#x27;s fundamental property of being a stateless protocol.  
Your Angular app will communicate with a backend that generates tokens. The Angular app can then send the token to the backend as an Authorization header to show they&#x27;re authenticated. The JWT should be checked by the backend, and access should be granted based on its validity.  
This tutorial will walk you through the process of developing and implementing JWT-based authentication in an Angular 11 application step by step. This tutorial takes you a step further by developing a back…</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>
