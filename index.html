                    <span>In my last post, I showed how to refactor the Dockerfile in your project. I didn&#x27;t want to make the previous post too long, so I didn&#x27;t touch the multistage builds. Here is the post where I will show you how to improve the Dockerfile even more, using multistage builds. Using stages in your builds is not hard to use, but there are some things where the below knowledge may help you 😃

                    <span>In the last few weeks, I&#x27;ve finally wrangled my head around Docker a bit. 
As a demo, I&#x27;ve built a docker container for kiterunner.
Kiterunner is an API-fuzzing tool, very useful for bug bounty hunters and pen-testers. Shoutouts to @insiderphd for introducing me to the tool. I should have watched that video sooner!
Like any good tool, it requires some installation stuff beforehand.
I realized this is a good opportunity to begin integrating Docker into my workflow in a potentially useful way.
To quickly get Docker installed on debian or ubuntu:
# Install Docker
sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

import Button from &quot;@kenaz/button&quot;;

Simple right? - The first imports the module statically at build-time, whereas the second imports the module dynamically at run-time. 
With the first code snippet, most ES bundler will include the button component in our final bundle. Whereas with the second snippet, our button could be split into a separate chunk. This could be an advantage when your page gets super duper complex with 1000 states, but the button is only needed in 1 of those states.

                    <span>When building your own projects, it would be nice if some of them will actually see the light of the world wide web instead of sadly sinking into oblivion. However, going through the whole process of successfully deploying your website to a hosting platform somewhere may sound a bit too discouraging for some developers. 
And that’s where a developer platform like Netlify comes to the rescue. With the use of their free starter plan, you can have your own personal project running in just a few steps.
In this tutorial I’ll show you these steps:
Setting up the environment.
Creating a new project. In this example I’ll create a new Angular demo project, but you can choose any other of the popular frameworks.
Creating a new repository on GitHub and pushing the demo project to the repository.

                    <span>Docker adoption rises constantly 📈 and many are familiar with it, but not everyone is using Docker according to the best practices. 👀
Before moving on, if you don&#x27;t know what Docker is, you can learn everything you need to get started in this free Docker Crash Course 🐳
So, in my new video &#x27;Top 8 Docker Production Best Practices&#x27; I want to show you 8 ways you can use Docker in a right way in your projects to:
✅ improve security,
✅ optimize the image size, 
✅ take advantage of some of the useful Docker features 
✅ and also write cleaner and more maintainable Dockerfiles







  
  
  1️⃣ Best Practice



Use an official and verified Docker image as a base image, whenever available.
Let&#x27;s say you are developing a Node.js application and want to build and run it as a Docker image.

In this article, we&#x27;ll actually utilise the service principal to export a solution and then save it into a DevOps repo.
You need a Power Platform environment with a solution you&#x27;d like to export. Your solution can be whatever you want. To make it very simple , I&#x27;ve just created a model driven app with one table that stores zoo animals.
You need a DevOps project with a repo you&#x27;d like the solution to be saved into.
You need a service principal with access to the Power Platform environment (see here)
Just a few things that&#x27;s important after you&#x27;ve set up your repo

                    <span>Google Cloud Build (GCB) is a building system provided by GCP. Considering all the competitors like GitLab CI, CircleCI and Travis CI, GCB is definitely not a common option for building CI CD pipeline.
In fact, I have tried to test GCB in my work at the early stage of adoption in GCP. The pros of GCB is definitely a full integration with GCP&#x27;s resources. If you are using GCP and have no preference at the CI pipeline platform, I highly suggest you to try it out.
Circling back to the GCB&#x27;s pipeline, all the configurations are written in JSON or YAML format. Here is an example for the GCB configuration.

Stage 6  -- Security group  --  ( It deals with ports )
        We have 0 to 65535  ports
        Every port is dedicated to special purpose

        RDP -- 3389
        SSH -- 22
        HTTP -- 80
        HTTPS - 443

        For windows machine , we need to open RDP port  ( Remote Desktop Protocol )
        He by default , we have RDP

Stage 7     Just observe the warnings, Just verify the options, Launch

Create a new keypair--  download key pair -- launch instance
We get the instance ID  i-0dddc6c37c9dfb460
Now, the new windows machines ,is having its own DNS Name, Username and password
We need to provide all the above 3 details in our laptop, so that we can connect.
We use an application called Remote Desktop Connection
AWS , gives us  DNS name , username, it does not give the password.
AWS gives an option to convert .pem to password





  

  How to connect .pem to password
Connect to instance Get password -- upload pem file -- Decrypt  
Open Remote Desktop
Hurray!!
Lets check the hardware configuration
To disconnect, just close the remote desktop window.

                    <span>Docker is a software platform for developing applications based on containers, which are tiny and efficient execution environments that share the operating system kernel but execute in isolation. While containers as a concept have been around for a while, Docker, an open-source project founded in 2013, helped popularize the technology and helped push the cloud-native development trend of containerization and microservices in software development.
One of the aims of contemporary software development is to keep apps running on the same host or cluster isolated from one another so that they don’t interfere with each other’s operation or maintenance. Due to the packages, libraries, and other software components necessary for them to execute, this might be tricky. Virtual machines are one answe…</span>

                    <span>If you have a requirement to create Live date or True time digital clock not exactly like above animation but at least show you running time live. For this you have to know basic Linux Command, Shell syntax &amp; Manual of Date command.
So Let&#x27;s Accomplished the Task ! (bold text are command).
If you want to create a delay in program we always use sleep Command an if you want to echo-back the command we always use $(date). But if you have requirement to remove a new-line in terminal we have -n option in echo. or If you have some other requirement to do operations like New-line, Backspace &amp; Tabulation. Then we have a options called -e stand for Sequence and you have to pass a sequence Character in string
For Example :-
    echo -e &quot;Hello\nWorld&quot; &#x3D; To add a New-line.
    echo -e &quot;Hello\bWorld&quot; &#x3D; To Backspace a letter.
    echo -e &quot;Hello\tWorld&quot; &#x3D; To add a Tabulation.

After know this syntax we are able to create live running time Clock. So let&#x27;s begin .
echo $(date +%r) &#x3D; It will give the output of this date command format.
echo -e &quot;$(date +%r)\b\b\b\b\b\b&quot; &#x3D; It will backspace the output (if command not work use below one).
echo -n  -e &quot;$(date +%r)\b\b\b\b\b\b&quot; &#x3D; It will backspace the output (Why we have to do this you will know in a minute).
echo -n  -e &quot;$(date +%r)\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b&quot; &#x3D; It will backspace all the output of command.
echo -n  -e &quot;$(date +%r)$(sleep 1)\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b&quot; &#x3D; It will add 1s delay in command.
Now we have to add this thing in Loop. So it will keep on running .
While :
    &gt; do
    &gt; echo -n  -e &quot;&#x60;date +%r&#x60;&#x60;sleep 1&#x60;\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b&quot;
    &gt; done

Now you will see the magic here the command is keep on running (Tick Tock).
If you want to save this command for some project like when creating your own module that time this mite be useful for you, So select a command and copy and create a file you can give any name and past it and save the file. To execute this file you can use bash filename.</span>

                    <span>Like many others, I spend enough time in the shell that even small improvements can yield huge productivity gains. This post is an attempt to catalog several of quality-of-life enhancements I&#x27;ve made over recent months to my shell setup.
Like most folks I know, I began my command-line life with good &#x27;ol Bash and actually still do most of my shell scripting in Bash. Even if I eventually rewrite the command in another language, many of my tools begin life as a Bash script.
At some point, perhaps ~10 years ago, I was introduced to ZSH with the venerable Oh My ZSH framework. For me, this was a huge awakening because it taught me about how much shell improvements can impact your life. I gradually evolved my ZSH setup to use package managers like antigen and began to invest more in creature comf…</span>

ls and cd. I use some of these commands myself, and I can&#x27;t imagine the programmer&#x27;s life without them.
Touch is one of the easiest commands that will help you to create a new empty file (you can also create a bunch of files) in the directory that you&#x27;re currently in.

                    <span>Hi, in this article I am going to simplify how to connect your local host to the Virtual Machine your created using Oracle Virtual Box, using SSH.
First of all, I am using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and I installed virtual box for some practicing on ubuntu - I don&#x27;t want to miss with my guy actually - and after installing Ubuntu on the virtual machine, I faced a problem while connecting my local host to the VM as most of us do while using VMs over the cloud or connecting to remote servers using SSH.
Below, is the steps in a simplified way to be able to connect to your VM from your local host using SSH
1- open the Virtual Box and select your virtual machine and click on settings.

2- you will go to networks and click on it, then click on advanced, then click on Port Forwarding.

3- once you click on …</span>

                    <span>I always wanted to mess around with programming. I studied International Relations and right after that, at the beginning of my working days, I started as Logo designer, continued as a UI designer, then moved to front-end development and ultimately I ended up being a graphic artist for a board game company called Final Frontier Games. Obviously, zero coding at the current workplace. Although I really enjoy working my current job, I needed to find a way to keep this feeling of satisfaction when I&#x27;m coding.
During my spare time while working as a graphic artist, I&#x27;ve been tinkering and creating few side projects in Python / Django. These are basically few tools that are supporting some of the internal processes of my company, such as board game rating tracking (I guess I will release an API …</span>

                    <span>There are times when we need to authenticate the user before giving him access to specific pages on our website.This authentication ensures that user has access to only those data that he has privileges on.
An entry level programmer would just fetch username and password stored in database at the time of login and if they match would give him access , which is not wrong but only half  a step in the process of authentication.
It is also necessary to ensure that of all the data stored in database only data related to user is shown.
This can be achieved in two ways:
Today we will talk and implement token based authentication in NodeJs.

Hey i got an account before i have created one using GitHub account. This is the account which i created, its been 2 months since i created it and for some unknown reasons i didnt came to quovery until 1 week back. I came and asked for help in discord to approve me as i have been waiting since week even after filling the forum which they gaved. So i came yesterday and asking help to login my account in quovery discord server and my comments are getting deleted and after asking why do i need to wait for weeks even if i have an account then some ambassador banned me without any notice 
Just because i questioned i got a bann even without doing anything bad. I just want JUSTICE. 
It seems they also deleted my posts in their forum and github too, they like a dictator
I just want to use website for my bot which is not against any rules or terms of service but without helping me or telling me what to do some ambassador straight banned me
I dont know if that ambassador got any issues or got grudge. I just want JUSTICE its my right to use website if i didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING wrong

I thought It might be a god idea to make my own setup which seemed to be a good start for any project you might start and it will save some time for those who like to work with Mysql rather than mongodb so I wish this help some people to start fresh in there projects.
Seems that my frontend not enough for that so if you like to make changes in it in my github repo you are welcomed to help other people with your changes.
Did I forget to mention that I used react-bootstrap to handle the UI,

                    <span>There are different ways to connect react backend and NodeJS frontend. In this blog, I am going to tell you three ways how you can connect backend and frontend. These are the ways most of the developers prefer.
React and NodeJS

The first way is having a single server that serves both Node API and React SPA under same domain. Here data is still exchanged through JSON. As you can see in the above picture, all the routes which do not start with /api will be handled by React SPA.
CORS errors🥶.
Copy build folder files from react app and paste them in public folder of NodeJS server.
Now server the static index.html which in the public folder




app.use(express.static(path.join(&#x27;public&#x27;)));
app.use((req,res) &#x3D;&gt; {
   res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, &#x27;public&#x27;, &#x27;index.html&#x27;));
});

Single server.
No more CORS errors 😅
Ideal for small applications.
As both frontend and backend will be handled by the same server, you may face performance issues.

As we use two different servers for backend and frontend, we get better performance.
Ideal for bigger applications.
Have to maintain two different servers.
The third way and the least preferred way is server-side rendering with template engines like ejs, handlebars, pugjs etc... Here we don&#x27;t create any REST API.
So, what other ways you know and what is your preferred way? Comment below 👇
Hope this helps you!

                    <span>Last week, I was mostly focused on contributing to IPC144 repo. I was once a student who was using the old IPC144 website, and it wasn&#x27;t the best experience, so I was so happy to see that people care about improving it and I was excited to contribute there too. Hopefully, it will make future students&#x27; experience so much better, now that fellow contributors and I have added so many improvements.
I was working on the following issues/PRs:

PR#68
I really liked that there was a clear list with all the requirements in the issues, so everyone knew what exactly to look for.

In the end of the writeup, I am going to be presenting you the intended solution, which I just figured out with a few hours of challenge remaining.
When we access the page https://challenge-1121.intigriti.io/challenge/index.php, it&#x27;s possible to see that there is a list of security issues, as known as the 2021 edition of OWASP TOP 10. There is also a search bar from where it&#x27;s possible to look for specific vulnerabilities. Whatever we type into this input will appear with the s query parameter when submitted.

If we try to submit, for example, a s value like

No matter how reliable modern gadgets are, nobody can feel safe from unexpected loss of photos for various reasons. The situation can be especially nasty when you come back home only to find the memory cards containing your photos to be broken or damaged, which means that the images of your remarkable impressions are gone.
To make sure you never face this situation, take our advice before going on a long-awaited trip, especially if the photographs you expect to bring home are one of the main reasons behind the route you have finally chosen.

The structure of ApFS file system is that of a B-tree, where the root directory containing data is the leaves of such tree.

                    <span>JavaScript has evolved quite a bit from its humble beginnings. Unfortunately, some of those advances have been difficult to take advantage of. Some require features not supported by all browsers, others require complicated tools. For my latest Mojolicious web app, I wanted to see how I could use Typescript with a minimum of fuss.
We&#x27;ll start from a simple Mojolicious::Lite app, created using mojo generate lite_app:
From there, we can install Typescript using Node. Since Typescript cannot bundle itself into a single file, we will also install Webpack:
npm install --save-dev typescript webpack webpack-cli ts-loader

After installation we can configure Typescript using its tsconfig.json file. We&#x27;ll use the public directory for our output, since this directory is served by Mojolicious.

                    <span>Recently I had to work with some automatically generated types whilst using GraphQL. This is a very extremely useful feature! However, it can be a little cumbersome to specifically reach different custom nested types from the requests without it being too verbose.
But, being a little creative with some native Typescript functions we can find a way to handle this exact use case!

Let’s take for example this generated type (For the sake of the example, this will be a fairly simple type with a nested subtype):
If we wanted to extract the type of the array without it getting too verbose we could use some conditional typing from Typescript.

The following type allows us to extract it:
It can be a little confusing at first glance but let’s break down every portion. First, we have our ArrayElement which is a generic receiving the array itself as T.
Here the infer keyword from typescript (which must be used with extends) to declaratively introduce a new generic type U based on the given array.
Now let’s assume that the TStuff type is an array and we want to extract a singular TStuff. We could then supply the type of TStuff[] to ArrayElement
type TNestedStuff &#x3D; ArrayElement;

Looking at the result of the extracted type we can now use it however we wish or even assign it as its own type to make it less verbose!

Here is the code sandbox to play around with the type and the Typescript documentation :

Typescript is superset of Javascript which means it is an extension of Javascript, adding new features and syntax on top of the core language.
Typescript is a strongly typed, object-oriented &amp; compiled language.
Typescript is designed to be compiled into fully compatible Javascript, so it works in any browser, any host, and any OS. 
We need typescript compiler to compile it to Javascript code because browsers do not understand typescript.
Typescript strongly encouraged static-typing which means it will validate all the assertions before the code executes. It allows you to do a type check during…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to understand the Angular terms and philosophy. One of the most basic building blocks of Angular seems to be a directive.
The Angular glossary says that &quot;A [directive is a] class that can modify the structure of the DOM or modify attributes in the DOM and component data model&quot;.
Seems VueJS also has the concept of directive.
directive is some special token in the markup that tells the library to do something to a DOM element.&quot;
This includes a reference to the AngularJS framework, and, yes, it seems AngularJS also has this term.
AngularJS docs:  &quot;At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS&#x27;s HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children.&quot;
Ok, so it seems that the term originally comes from AngularJS, and Angular and VueJS just inherited it.
I guess, in Layman terms, a directive is a way of &quot;teaching the HTML to do new tricks&quot; (not mine). 
directive?
Still not sure, maybe the creators thought of this term because a directive it&#x27;s like commanding (giving directives/instructions/orders) to a static technology (HTML) in order to make it smarter.</span>

Today, I&#x27;ll be talking about which is better: React or Angular. Feel free to share your opinions in the comments below!
Let&#x27;s get it!

 ✨ Javascript is one of the most popular languages ​​among developers today. There are many developers, newbies, and *seasoned aficionados* who build their application or project using Javascript, but still, there is confusion when choosing the right framework or library for their design. ✨ 

Soooo Angular and React are both popular but developers can&#x27;t really decide upon WHICH is good for their project. 🤷‍♂️
Most learners and students want to learn a framework that could help in getting them a good job in the market. 🤓
Alright I honestly think I&#x27;m wasting your time lets get to the point. 😂

                    <span>Terraform Introduction and Overview


Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code technology and it is used to create immutable infrastructure. It allows infrastructure to be expressed as code in a simple, human readable language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). 
Deliver infrastructure as code with Terraform using declarative .tf configuration files.
Plan and predict changes: Terraform provides an elegant user experience for operators to safely and predictably make changes to infrastructure. It reads configuration files and provides an execution plan of changes, which can be reviewed for safety and then applied and provisioned.
Extensible providers allow Terraform to manage a broad range of resources, including IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and hardware services.

So every now and then i see something that catches my eye. Recently that seems to be Linux Distributions, over the last few months i have changed my distribution&#x27;s a few times to try and find one i&#x27;m comfortable with. I moved from my iMac (getting a bit sluggish) to Ubuntu originally and it worked but i didn&#x27;t &quot;enjoy it&quot;, i then tried Manjaro, then Pop!_OS and then finally thought id have a go with Elementary OS.
So far i am really enjoying it! it feels a bit &quot;Mac&#x27;ish&quot;, Looks nice and feels quick!
But compared to Ubuntu its a little bit different with the Setup of the dev environment, so i thought id write up a little tutorial on setting a Laravel Dev Environment on Elementary OS.
So as with any tutorial i do with Linux, we start with an update/upgrade.

                    <span>Introduction


One of the more common practices in software projects is to keep certain information separated but accessible from the codebase which uses it. This is usually done with secrets such as passwords or private keys, but is also commonly done with user or context-specific info pieces. However, management of environment variables can be confusing. The solutions to deal with it are many, and there are even built-in ones such as bash_profile. 
direnv, a shell extension which enables the definition of a list of environment variables scoped by a directory. After installing &amp; hooking the extension, direnv will execute every time you change directories, looking for an .envrc file in the same or in a superior directory tree level. It will then load the defined variables to the current en…</span>

  Development on Linux


I switched to Linux last year and shifted my development completely to the Linux ecosystem. Tried out arch, Manjaro, Pop OS!, Ubuntu, MX Linux. Development is really productive with a Linux environment.
A few months back I upgraded my potato to a gaming laptop which of course came with Windows pre-installed, I also started gaming. I ended up doing dual boot to run Ubuntu as my daily driver for development, but this eventually meant a redundant set of tools on Windows as well.
Windows released the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 in May 2019. WSL 1 was a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables on Windows. WSL2 built on top is built on the core technology of Hyper-V to provide better support and improved perf…</span>

                    <span>Node.JS is a technology that has transformed JavaScript, which is familiar to all web developers, from a client-side scripting language to a general-purpose language that has a large number of application use cases.
 
At the heart of how Node works.js is asynchronous. In addition to non-blocking I / O, this allows a server-side application on Node.js can handle much more client requests per unit of time than a similar application developed on most other server-side development technologies.

With the right architecture, this allows you to scale your business without investing a lot of money.

There are many pages wich explain what the Spread Operator (also know as three dots) and Rest Parameters are. 
It is an operator that I really like and I would like to share with you some ways that I use it.
📓 Spread Operator
let numbers &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log( numbers );

// &#x3D;&gt; [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] (print as array)

When we use the spread operator we get the values ​​independently:
let numbers &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log( ...numbers );

// &#x3D;&gt; 1 2 3 4

Add an array to another:
let customers &#x3D; [ &#x27;Claudia&#x27;, &#x27;Borja&#x27;, &#x27;May&#x27; ];
let otherCustomers &#x3D; [ &#x27;Sergio&#x27;, &#x27;Jose&#x27; ];

customers.push( ...otherCustomers );
console.log( customers );

// &#x3D;&gt; [ &#x27;Claudia&#x27;, &#x27;Borja&#x27;, &#x27;May&#x27;, &#x27;Sergio&#x27;, &#x27;Jose&#x27; ]

The process of writing a test case can also help reveal errors or defects within the system.

Node.js is not a Framework or Programming Language but a runtime environment built on top of Chrome&#x27;s V8 engine to execute JavaScript outside of the browser, SIMPLE!
I often read articles where the author mentions Node.js as a JavaScript Framework and even compares it with PHP Frameworks, Ruby Frameworks, C# Frameworks, and also with JavaScript frontend frameworks and libraries like Angular, React, and jQuery.
Kindly stop this and don&#x27;t misguide the people as this is really confusing for beginners who are trying to understand what Node.js is under the hood as Node.js has a lot to offer than just a Web Framework or JavaScript library.

Another change that should not add extra scope, is to remove DELETE from the Access-Control-Allow-Methods header.

Electron.JS, in its main purpose - is for creating desktop applications using Javascript. Most popular way of doing so is using React &amp; Node.js.
I will introduce a code architecture for building scalable Electron application - and on the fly - compile the code on chosen OS platform.
I am not going to focus on implementing it with an Electron application because there is no need for this tutorial, but you should know that the best application of this tutorial resides in Electron applications.
We are going to code the application to both Darwin and Windows platforms in one workspace - but as we&#x27;ll see, in compilation we will be compiling only one (chosen by us) platform code. Because in most cases, you will need to code a code for 2 (at-least) platforms. But, we of-course don&#x27;t want …</span>

                    <span>So I haven&#x27;t written in a while. It&#x27;s a slow day so I thought, how about we write a web crawler tutorial?
so, this code can easily be switched to js, and you can find a deno_dom replacement in cheerio with node js. 
The main thing a crawler needs is valid markup.
tl;dr

I am currently building out my project for a deno/rust search engine with mellisearch as part of a larger project.
Since this is a deno backend, I&#x27;m taking advantage of the ability to use typescript OOB. Its handy, especially with the ability to create interfaces that can extend others.
What should a web crawler do?
Crawl to a depth blindly
Be rate limited in the calling
Crawl unique links
Parse URLs
Handle edge cases
probably some other stuff

The purpose of a test case is to determine if different features within a system are performing as expected and to confirm that the system satisfies all related standards, guidelines and customer requirements. The process of writing a test case can also help reveal errors or defects within the system.
What is a Test Case? - SearchSoftwareQuality
The above is the best way to describe tests. 
TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome&#x27;s V8 JavaScript engine.
Jest is a JavaScript Testing Framework.

1) With angular 13 now its Ivy everywhere but we have Ivy from angular 9 (by default) so what is new here.
2) For Library authors earlier it is recommended to use enableIvy: false which now not doable as we have no Ivy but we have other option compilationMode: &quot;partial&quot; so they both are same?
3) If a new library is published with angular version 13. then can it be consumed in an application which is non-ivy?
4) Everywhere we have benefits of Angular 13 but in practical what will be disadvantages for already developed applications</span>

                    <span>How to create sticky columns in Angular using directives. Implementing tables with sticky columns can be tricky especially when you have to make multiple columns sticky. Using directives, we can easily implement sticky columns.
I can&#x27;t emphasize more the power of directives in Angular. I&#x27;ve written a couple of articles showcasing how one can actually use it to implement really cool stuff. You can check some use-cases for directives here:  Angular Directive Showcase.

We make use of the position: sticky CSS property to make an element sticky. Read more about sticky positioning at  MDN.
.sticky {
  position: sticky;
  left: 0;
}

For the sticky position to work properly, at least one of top, right, bottom, or left should be specified.
Making the first column in a table sticky is super simple…</span>

InterSystems IRIS 2019 is going to introduce new and exciting features. One of the areas with new interesting must-to-know things is the API Management. 
OpenAPI initiative (https://www.openapis.org/) is the organization supporting a standard specification to define APIs (https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification). The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Simila…</span>

Are users that should have access actually in?
If you can&#x27;t answer with certainty both questions, how can you claim to have a secure application? This is something that you can test manually, but a better alternative is test automation. Concretely, I think the best methodology to get there is using Test-Driven Development (TDD).
This piece is about adding authorization to a Ruby on Rails API by following TDD. You can check out this article to learn in detail how to secure a Rails API with Auth0. Also, you can follow this article along with this repository.

                    <span>The global influx of digital transformation is creating pressure on infrastructure. All the while, threat actors are continually improving their attack techniques. If there is a vulnerability to be found, it will be exploited. 
This is why many teams are shifting security to the left, even going as far as evolving their dev methodology from DevOps to DevSecOps.
Developers still have remaining concerns, most of which focus on release time. However, you should not have to compromise fast releases in favor of security. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a question of either/or.
In this article, you will learn about four methods that you can take advantage of to secure your React apps quickly. These are simple security practices that should not interrupt your workflow.

Hello there. Welcome to this week&#x27;s review, I am your host Habdul Hazeez.
This week&#x27;s review is about malware, vulnerabilities,  computer security and one article that I authored.

Zoom Patches High-Risk Flaws in Meeting Connector, Keybase Client


Zoom, the technology breakout star of the COVID-19 pandemic. They were in the news for all sorts of privacy-related stuff, ever since they&#x27;ve stepped up their security, this is another step in that direction.
Excerpt from the article:
The company released multiple security bulletins to warn of the risks and called special attention to a pair of “high-risk” bugs affecting its on-prem meeting connector software and the popular Keybase Client.

To begin our experiment, we chose 1,000 Javascript projects on GitHub that were recently updated and had between 50 and 200 stars in rating. Next, we went to UpWork.com and paid non-professionals £5/hour to use the Uleska Platform to automatically run three Javascript source code security testing tools. We consolidated the results generated by the platform to the project teams and made sure they didn’t have security or programming skills.
We didn’t set up any of our cyber value-at-risk enumerations, as they would apply to how an open-source library is used within the end-user application (i.e. types of data processed, quantity of data, environment etc.).
We also made the decision not to triage the results, as the Uleska Platfo…</span>
