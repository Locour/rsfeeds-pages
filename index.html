                    <span>Introduction


Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
Bootstrap is an open source CSS framework with many components for building responsive WEB interfaces.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the application with the Angular base structure using the @angular/cli with the route file and the SCSS style format.
ng new angular-bootstrap
? Would you like to add Angular routing? Yes
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? SCSS   [ https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss                ]

                    <span>A simple POC where Angular requests the URL of an image to the Quarkus back end and then renders the image in the screen. Quarkus returns the image in two ways: (1) a simple copy from the URL of the image; (2) the image encoded in Base64 with the Media Type.
The project is available on GitHub poc-http-copy-images.

Let&#x27;s imagine a hypothetical situation where only the backend have access to the URL of some images and you want to render these images on the frontend.
In this POC, I propose two ways of solving this problem:
The backend access the URL of the image and expose the same Response object;
The backend access the URL of the image, encode it into Base64 and expose it into a JSON object with the Media Type.
Optionally, you can run a Quarkus mock server which will provide three endpoints with the below images:
http://localhost:8090/image/earth.png
http://localhost:8090/image/moon.jpg
http://localhost:8090/image/solarsystem.svg
*** Optionally, because you can choose any image from the internet to run the test.
Enter inside the mock-server folder and type:
$ mvn quarkus:dev -Ddebug&#x3D;5006

The swagger will be available at:
http://localhost:8090/q/swagger-ui

Enter inside the quarkus folder and type:
$ mvn quarkus:dev -Ddebug&#x3D;5006

The swagger will be available at:
http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui

Enter inside the angular folder and type:
$ npm install
$ ng serve

The front end will be available at:
http://localhost:4200/
Ok, in this screen, just put the URL of any image you desire (of the mock or the internet) and click on Load Image:

After clicking in the button, the image will be displayed in two columns, the left one is the raw copy from the URL and the right one is the Base64 version:

Any new image searched will be shown and the previous ones will slide down:</span>

                    <span>Hello!
I wanted to share a YouTube series I developed on Go. The intended audience is primarily people in DevOps roles, but I think it will also be beneficial for those who are just starting to learn Go and are looking for a practical project to help them get started. Below is a detailed outline of the series so you know exactly what you will learn:
++++YouTube Playlist Link++++
Series Outline:
Video 1: Creating a Slack App - This video doesn&#x27;t include any coding but covers the pre-requisite steps you must complete in order for the Go program that you write in later videos to work properly
Video 2: How to Publish a Message - Now you get to write some code, and I introduce you to the https://github.com/slack-go/slack library. Using the slack-go library, I show you how to send messages to a channel in your Slack workspace
Video 3: Command-line arguments and Block Kit - I walk you through modifying the Go program to accept command-line arguments and I introduce you to Slack&#x27;s Block Kit.
Video 4 : Run our Slack Bot as a Jenkins Post-Build Action - This video focuses more on integrating the program with Jenkins so most of it is optional if you&#x27;re more interested in learning Go. I walk you through the development of a Jenkins pipeline that runs the Go program as a post-build action (and sends a notification to your designated Slack channel on whether the Jenkins pipeline build passed or failed).
Video 5: Convert Bot to Microservice and add API Endpoint - I walk you through re-architecting the Go program as a microservice with a single API endpoint, rather than having Jenkins run the program on the Jenkins node.
Video 6: Add JSON processing to our API endpoint - I introduce you to JSON processing in Go using &quot;encoding/json&quot; so that the API endpoint in the microservice accepts JSON arguments.
I hope that you find the series valuable and moreover that you enjoy it!</span>

                    <span>Building good images can be challenging. We want to provide enough abstraction and flexibility for the image to be used in different scenarios without having to rebuild them in every case. We also want to make it easy for users to use the image.
When building docker images, it is oftentimes enough to use normal commands to start the container.
FROM alpine
CMD [&quot;echo&quot;, &quot;Hello, world!&quot;]

Occasionally, an additional entry point is used. When written like this, it is mostly for convenience, but there are some elaborate use cases.
FROM alpine
ENTRYPOINT [&quot;echo&quot;]
CMD [&quot;Hello, world!&quot;]

Sometimes, we really need to do more work or operate on environment variables, which can be tricky due to the difference in shell and exec syntax in the Dockerfile. In that case, a script commonly called entrypoin…</span>

                    <span>Your learning of a programming language will remain in it forever and you will not be able to move to another language, but by teaching you programming itself, you will be able to identify the concept that transfers you from one language to another easily, and you must understand that programming languages are only tools that can be changed at any time. Watch the following example with me.
If I ask you to search for a specific element inside an Array and bring me the position of the element (Position, Index) inside the Array, what will you do? 
The first thing is if you are learning a language such as PHP, Python, JavaScript, there is a method that does the process very easy. Watch the example in more than one language to understand the idea.

Our team is experimenting with Hashicorp Vault as our new credentials management solution. Thanks to the offical Vault Helm Chart, we are able to get an almost production-ready vault cluster running on our Kubernetes cluster with minimal effort.
Our 5-node vault cluster is highly available by using the provided Integrated Storage Raft backend. The vault cluster is run as a Kubernetes StatefulSet and each node has its own data storage. Each data storage is powered by a Block Storage on IBM Cloud via PersistentVolumeClaim.
Unfortunately, the open source vault does not provide an out-of-the-box automated backup solution. It is only offer in Vault Enterprise. Apprently, our team doesn&#x27;t have a deep pocket to pay for the license fee.

                    <span>Understanding Kubernetes can be difficult or time-consuming. In order to spread knowledges about Cloud technologies I started to create sketchnotes about Kubernetes, then I&#x27;ve auto-published a book and since now I&#x27;ve started a new serie of video! :-)
I imagined a serie of short videos with a mix of sketchnotes and speech.
I think it could be a good way, more visual, with audio &amp; video to explain Kubernetes (and others technologies).
In this new episode, let&#x27;s talk about Pod &amp; Node Affinities and Anti Afinities.




The video is in French BUT I done the subtitles in english (and french too).
If you liked the video and are interested to watch another ones, please give me some feedbacks (and you can also subscribe to my Youtube channel, if you want to ❤️).
If you are interested, I published all the sketchnotes on Kubernetes (and new ones!) to make a &quot;book&quot; of 165 pages: &quot;Understanding Kubernetes in a visual way&quot;.
If you like theses sketchnotes, you can follow me, I will publish others sketchs shortly :-).</span>

Kafka Broker Discovery
As previously tackled, a Kafka cluster is composed of multiple brokers and each broker is basically a server.
Each broker is identified by an ID (integer)
Each broker contains certain topic partitions
good start is 3 brokers
It is also important to note that when you connect to a broker, which is called the bootstrap broker, you&#x27;re already connecting to the entire cluster.

Since 2018, Azure DevOps Services has provided free CI/CD pipelines for its users. By default, it allowed a developer to run arbitrary code for up to 1800 free minutes per month on Microsoft-hosted agents and ten parallel jobs for public projects. However, the market capitalization of cryptocurrency has skyrocketed in recent years, and as a result, it has become very profitable for some folks to violate the terms of service of PaaS providers’ free tiers, like Azure DevOps, to run cryptocurrency miners as a step in their build pipeline.

                    <span>In today’s article, I guide you through your Azure DevOps setup to perform automated load tests using k6. Before we begin, I want to take a minute to explain what load tests are and why they are essential.
There are many different types of testing in software development. For example, some tests check that different models of an application work together as expected (integration testing), some focus on the business requirements of an application by verifying the output of action without considering the intermediate state (functional testing), and others perform different types of testing. Load testing is a type of performance testing as well as a type of stress test and capacity test. It focuses on verifying the application’s stability and reliability under both normal and peak load condit…</span>

   Since LinkedIn has multiple functions, there is more than one way to answer this question depending on what purpose you want to utilize the platform for. Many people use it for exploring the jobs market and making themselves visible to potential employers. But my expertise is in using LinkedIn for B2B lead generation, and so I’m going to talk about the most effective ways to do that.

LinkedIn is an incredible tool for lead generation – there are millions of decision-makers regularly using the platform. But it is still relatively underused for lead generation given the massive potential for great leads it offers.
I’ve found that it’s important to conduct multiple activities on LinkedIn to really make the most of it and get those great le…</span>

Conclusion
Okay so attempt #1 didn&#x27;t quite work, but all the package managers have a feature called Workspaces, which npm describes like this:
[Workspaces] provides support to managing multiple packages from your local files system from within a singular top-level, root package.
That sure sounds relevant, so let&#x27;s give it a try!



The npm documentation is so terse I&#x27;ve honestly no clue how to get anything working 🤷‍♀️. If you know your way around npm workspaces I&#x27;m happy to swap stories, but for now I&#x27;m giving up on this.



Documentation here is definitely a step up, with more examples to draw inspiration from. Still a bit hard to grasp though, but I also came across this nice &quot;actual complete guide to typescript monorepos&quot; article by @cryogenicplanet

I recently rediscovered my passion for coding after taking a Node.js course and decided to create a fun little side project called Crypto FOMO. You can view it below:
👉 Crypto FOMO 😱
Front End Source
Serverless Source
The idea is to make the user wonder how much money they would probably have if they had invested in a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin a couple years back instead of buying an item such as an Apple Macbook. I actually did not come up with this idea and saw a site similar to this a couple years back but unfortunately do not remember the original site or creator 😢.
Here are the technologies that I worked with for the first time ever 👶:

To see this in action you need to like and retweet the below tweet (It will take a minute to reflect the changes in the profile name)
So, In this article i will explain all the steps that i took to create this twitter bot from scratch and also explain how you can host it on the DigitalOcean Droplet for free.

The fetch API in JavaScript is used to make requests. It can also be used to consume APIs. Let&#x27;s take a look at some of the most common operations using fetch API. 
I will be working in a NodeJs environment

                    <span>I have a csv file that I need to parse and store in a database. I use sequelize for this 
Here is how I defined the model of my table in sequelize :
    const Person&#x3D; sequelize.define(
      &#x27;person&#x27;,
      {
        id: {
          type: DataTypes.UUID,
          primaryKey: true,
          defaultValue: uuidv4(),
          allowNull: false
        },
        name: {
          type: DataTypes.STRING,
        },
        age: {
          type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
        }
        }, {
            createdAt: false,
            updatedAt: false,        
            tableName: &#x27;person&#x27;
         }
    )
    return Person
  }

then I have a csv file &quot;test.csv&quot;:
he ,dd
liza, 23
sarah, 22

basically I can&#x27;t change the headers in my csv file and I have to keep the same structure defined in the db, I use papaparse to parse this file :
        const papa &#x3D; require(&#x27;papaparse&#x27;);
        const fs &#x3D; require(&#x27;fs&#x27;)

        const file &#x3D; fs.createReadStream(__basedir + &quot;/test.csv&quot;);


        papa.parse(file, {
          header: true,
          step: async function(results, parser) {
            console.log(&quot;Row data:&quot;, results.data);
            try{
              await Person.create(results.data)

            }catch(e){
              console.log(e)
            }

          }
      });

in output I get the following error :
SequelizeUniqueConstraintError: Validation error

the name, surname and age fields are null in the database
I am looking for a solution to ignore the headers of the csv file, how can I do that?</span>

When you have a built a single-page-application using Ember CLI you have two options for starting your app locally. You can either use the CLI&#x27;s ember serve command directly or you can use the handy npm alias that is created for you after generating a new Ember app: npm run start
But what&#x27;s the difference between those two?
npm run start is used for


First, npm run start allows you to create your own default boot up command for your application by e.g. passing additional parameters to ember serve and hide this modified booting instruction away in one, single, shorthand command via a definition in your package.json. This makes you type less and can make your life easier when developing your app locally.

                    <span>Introduction


Node.js allows code to be written and stored in (preferably) small modules.  These modules can then be referenced from other modules to build up larger applications.  What exactly is a module though, and how can code be accessed from within a module?
Let&#x27;s take a look at a small piece of code that we can easily turn into a Node.js module.  Consider we have a method that allows us to drink tea.
function drinkTea() {
    console.log(&quot;Mmm, delicious.&quot;);
}

If this method was placed within a large JavaScript file, we could simply invoke the function drinkTea() to enjoy a warm beverage.  To create a module however, we simply place this function within its own file and tell Node about any functions we wish callers of the module to access.
Within Node.js, we could therefore create …</span>

Well, firstly it is going to be hosted on repl.it, so if you want to customize the domain, refer here. Anyways now on to the actual part. So I will be using this simple flask app to demostrate - 
Ok so once you have your website/API written in repl.it, Run the code by using the Run button on the top of the screen,

Zazwyczaj jak potrzeba coś zrobić szybko to używa się gotowych rozwiązań. W przypadku websocket istnieje wiele implementacji tego protokołu. 
Zacząłem od stworzenia w node dwóch serwerów. Pierwszy serwer to serwer http. Jest odpowiedzialny za wyświetlanie strony, dzięki której
tcp jest odpowiedzialny za odebranie i wysłanie tej samej wiadomości.
Pierwszą rzeczą jaką należy zrobić po połączeniu klienta z serwerem jest przygotowanie uścisku dłoni.

Ten pakiet będzie zawierał ramkę. Skupie się tylko na tej części ramki która pozwala odczytać i wysłać wiadomość tekstową.
Żeby zdemaskować tekst, każdy bajt powinien być przepuszczony przez algorytm który kryje się w funkcji mapUnmask.
Gdy już tekst zostanie przepuszczony przez algorytm. Należy go następnie wysłać. Żeby to zrobić, kopiuje pierwszy bajt.

                    <span>Welcome to the World of JavaScript! This is the age of JavaScript. JavaScript is everywhere in the Full Stack. I am planning to solve a couple of problems that I faced in my work and other places. Let&#x27;s try solving 30 crazy problems I had in the next 30 days, starting from Feb 14th! Also, Eddie Jaoude (one of the very few GitHub Stars in this entire Milky Way Galaxy) is going to do the honours of kick-starting this event!

                    <span>Introduction


In current days we host websites on Vercel and Netlify and we are automatically assigned a generated SSL to provide with Secured connection(HTTPS), but in the development period we are unaware of the process to run it with HTTPS and we miss out on some testing which works only on HTTPS like google apis, etc.
Configure creat-react-app project to handle https
Generate SSL Certificates for localhost
Add certificates to the project
Trust certificate in browser
Run the project secured
Add a file .env in the root directory of the project with the line
HTTPS&#x3D;true

Follow this article to generate a SSL certificate for localhost. and place the certificates in the root directory.
Generate an SSL Certificate With the Root Certificate for localhost

rootCA.key
rootCA.pem
rootCA.srl
server.crt
server.csr
server.csr.cnf
server.key
v3.ext

in the .env file add these two properties and there paths.
SSL_CRT_FILE&#x3D;server.crt
SSL_KEY_FILE&#x3D;server.key

Here you will be using the server.crt as your certificate file &amp; server.key as your key for certificate.
Follow this article to trust the certificate on your browser 
Hence you have HTTPS enabled for your project.

Conclusion
Okay so attempt #1 didn&#x27;t quite work, but all the package managers have a feature called Workspaces, which npm describes like this:
[Workspaces] provides support to managing multiple packages from your local files system from within a singular top-level, root package.
That sure sounds relevant, so let&#x27;s give it a try!



The npm documentation is so terse I&#x27;ve honestly no clue how to get anything working 🤷‍♀️. If you know your way around npm workspaces I&#x27;m happy to swap stories, but for now I&#x27;m giving up on this.



Documentation here is definitely a step up, with more examples to draw inspiration from. Still a bit hard to grasp though, but I also came across this nice &quot;actual complete guide to typescript monorepos&quot; article by @cryogenicplanet

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using sveltekit and svelte for over a year now. I&#x27;m also anxiously waiting for it to be matured enought to beat NextJs in terms of community. But I like them both.
So, on this weekend I wanted to turn one of my projects into a PWA. When I wanted to do with NextJs projects there were a lot of tutorials. But I couldn&#x27;t find many guides for svelte beginners.
That&#x27;s because svelte has pwa functionality built into it.
 A website
 manifest.json [ basic icons,names,shortcuts]
 service-worker [ for offline cache ]
So let&#x27;s get on with it.

We&#x27;ll create a demo Sveltekit project:
npm init svelte@next my-app


Then we&#x27;ll choose a simple config in vite for the sake of this article:

Choose typescript because ts &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; js:

Now we have a demo project setup with typescript, it will be straight-forward from here on:

Let&#x27;s get into our directory:
cd my-app

And run:
yarn


After that,
In the /static directory, We&#x27;ll create a manifest.json.
When svelte compiles the whole application the static files will be copied over to the build folder.

Then we&#x27;ll refer our manifest.json in src/app.html.

And finally we&#x27;ll create our src/service-worker.ts
Svelte will automatically detect the service-worker in the src folder&#x27;s root and then register our service worker during build.
Isn&#x27;t that neat?

Now we just need to build or app using yarn build:

Now we can preview our build using yarn preview:

&#x27;0&#x27; is that a &#x27;install app&#x27; button,

Svelte makes it easy to make PWAs.

                    <span>Hi, 
in operator. 
Note: The in operator is javascript feature not TypeScript.
Consider the following scenario: I am writing a todo application. In my todo application I have two types of Todos:
Anonymous Todo
Validated Todo
Anonymous todo have text and id fields. Lets write an interface for it
interface AnonymousTodo {
    text: string;
    id: number;
}

Validated Todo is similar to anonymous todo but with two extra fields authorName and validationDate. Lets write interface for it too.
interface ValidatedTodo {
    text: string;
    id: number;
    authorName: string;
    validationDate: Date;
}

so far so good, now lets write a method which will print the todo to console. So if anonymous todo is passed we should prepend anonymous logging text and id, but if ValidatedTodo is passed we sh…</span>

The pwd command for to know you where you are now. For example your’re in download folder. Try the following type pwd and you will see that you’re in your download directory.
For Linux you can type clear or Ctrl+L to Clear the screen. It works in most terminal.
Command ls is equivalent to the DOS dir command, that it show lists files and directories. This command has some common attributes, example like:
ls -a for show all folders and files including visible and hidden.
ls -l for show the contents of the directory in full, starting from access rights, owner, group and the date the file or directory was created.
ls -i show directory contents and size.
For troubleshooting you can use command tail -f. Example like this tail -f /var/log/daemon.log.
If you want to see the previous commands, you can type history in your terminal. Meanwhile, to search command history in Linux, press ctrl+R, then just type the previous command you want to search or use.</span>

1. netstat:
netstat stands for Network Statistics. This is very basic command used to print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics etc.

Syntax:
netstat [OPTIONS]

There are various options which are supported by netstat command. Listing few of them in below
netstat -i: i stands for Interface.(Network Interface shows that how kernel links up with the software network side to the hardware network side.
Example:

netstat -r: r stands for Routing. It will show kernel IP routing tables.
Example:

2. nslookup:
nslookup stands for Name Server lookup. It helps us to check the IP address mapped to DNS(Domain Name System) and vice versa. This is very useful when we want to troubleshoot the DNS related issue.

So without further ado, let&#x27;s get on with todays blog.

To learn about how Linux came to be, let’s go back to the beginning to 1969 where Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories developed the UNIX operating system. It was later rewritten in C to make it more portable and eventually became a widely used operating system.
A decade or so later, Richard Stallman started working on the GNU (GNU is Not UNIX) project, the GNU kernel called Hurd, which unfortunately never came to completion. The GNU General Public License (GPL), a free software li…</span>

                    <span>Hi!We use smartphone,laptop and other devices. All of them access to the internet. Many files have malware, If you install or use these files, you will have many problems also hackers can access to your data such as accounts and passwords.I wrote name of some apps that you should not use these apps. I will introduce more secure apps.











In conclusion
Many people think google is really safe but it isn&#x27;t!!!. Google apps are nice in the UI, services and etc,However in security doesn&#x27;t have standard features.I hope you enjoy this article if it is good, share with your friends and if you have any question or any other review, comment that.HAVE A NICE TIME AND GOOD SECURITY :).

                    <span>Hi!We use smartphone,laptop and other devices. All of them access to the internet. Many files have malware, If you install or use these files, you will have many problems also hackers can access to your data such as accounts and passwords.I wrote name of some apps that you should not use these apps. I will introduce more secure apps.











In conclusion
Many people think google is really safe but it isn&#x27;t!!!. Google apps are nice in the UI, services and etc,However in security doesn&#x27;t have standard features.I hope you enjoy this article if it is good, share with your friends and if you have any question or any other review, comment that.HAVE A NICE TIME AND GOOD SECURITY :).

The Good
The Bad


Why don&#x27;t we script that?
What about Yarn?
Let&#x27;s get the simple solution out of the way first: Can&#x27;t we just move everything into different projects within the same repository?
To test that out let&#x27;s extract web and api into two separate apps, and make a libs folder for the shared dependencies. By moving the files around we end up with this structure:
webby
├── apps
│  ├── api/
│  └── web/
├── libs
│  ├── analytics/
│  ├── logging/
│  └── types/
└── tsconfig-base.json

And if we look at web&#x27;s package.json we see a small list of dependencies that are used entirely by web:
    &quot;express&quot;: &quot;^4.17.1&quot;,
    &quot;react&quot;: &quot;^17.0.2&quot;,
    &quot;react-dom&quot;: &quot;^17.0.2&quot;,
    &quot;react-router-dom&quot;: &quot;^5.2.0&quot;,
    &quot;types&quot;: &quot;file:../../libs/types&quot;

                    <span>Why should you use Typescript?


Simple. It solves your problem. Let&#x27;s see.
Type checking: This is why typescript really exist. It adds type checking over javascript. It stops you to write stupid code.

Let&#x27;s see an example:
const addNums &#x3D; (a, b) &#x3D;&gt; {
    return a + b
}

a and b should be number. But you stupidly pass strings.
addNums(&#x27;1&#x27;, &#x27;2&#x27;)

outupt:
&#x27;12&#x27;

We don&#x27;t want this to happen. It was a stupid example. But if you are working on bigger project, this kind of bug can happen easily. You waste hours and hours to fix the code. 

This where typescript rescues us with type checking.
const addNums &#x3D; (a: number, b: number) &#x3D;&gt; {
    return a + b
}

Now if you pass string it will give you error so that you can fix it.

The Two Extremes of Code Organization


Files &amp; Folders
Everything&#x27;s a Repository
Finding the middle ground


A note on TypeScript
I need your help!
So what&#x27;s the plan?
A quick word before we begin
The Attempts
I like simple code, in the &quot;low coupling, high cohesion&quot; sort of way where code is packaged into understandable, self-contained clumps that does an understandable &quot;thing&quot;. That way I don&#x27;t have to understand everything all at once, instead I can get an overview at the high-level and dive into the details when relevant to the work that needs doing.
We all chop our code into understandable abstractions already: We write functions and classes into separate files and folders. But as our project grows so does the need to keep organizing our code&#x27;s abstractions, and …</span>

                    <span>I recently completed an online course and these are my takeaway from Composition and Inheritance.
With inheritance we can extend the functionality of an existing class by overriding its method in a Child class e.g
class Parent {
  function sayHi() {
    console.log(&quot;sayHi from Parent&quot;);
  }
}
class Child {
  function sayHi() {
    console.log(&quot;sayHi from the Child&quot;);
  }
}

Inheritance is characterised by an &quot;is-a&quot; relationship between two classes e.g Apple is Fruit, Car is a Vehicle etc. Inheritance is suited for use cases where there is tight coupling between the classes which is rarely the case in the real world.
Lets say your are building a house and you need to model a window in code. So you might come up with following:

I used expressjs to create a webserver, everything is working ok. I add the dist folder into .gitignore file, so the only file that got pushed to github repository is the src folder which mean the typescript file. And I want to connect Heroku and my github repository. The problem is, the file that should be in Heroku is the .js file, not the .ts.
What is the correct way to deploy a typescript project to Heroku ?

Sometimes we create promises that take too long to finish and we don&#x27;t want to wait. For example, if we want to make a request and the response takes 20 seconds to finish and for any reason we may want to throw an error in the first 5 seconds and proceed to the next code block.
In this article, we will see how to implement a promise which throws an error after a specific time span. It supports typings with the power of Typescript and accepts a custom error to be thrown when the time comes.
First of all, we create a new promise that rejects an error after a time span in milliseconds. The return type of the timeout promise is never which represents the type of values that never occur. For instance, never is the return type for a function expression or…</span>

                    <span>Working with TypeScript can be a blissful experience – the type completions, the fast feedback loop, and the confidence gained by the presence of types make up for a great DX.
But yet, sometimes, these experiences are interrupted by moments of frustration. For example, maybe the library you have just pulled from npm does not expose type declarations? Or perhaps TypeScript is not aware of a global variable you know exists?
If that describes your experiences, read on. The following contains tips regarding extending TypeScript type declarations. I believe that by following them, the number of frustrations you experience while working with TypeScript will drastically decrease.

*ngIf and *ngFor will remove elements from the DOM. There isn’t a CSS solution for animating a non-existing element in the DOM. But Angular provides us with a simple solution.
For purposes of brevity, wherever I refer to *ngIf it is equally applicable to *ngFor. The complete, working code can be downloaded here.
Let’s start with the default application generated by the CLI and just modify the nice Angular logo in and out of the view based on a button we add.
ng new ngifAnimation

You won’t need routing and can select SCSS for the styling.
Let’s add the button we want to use to toggle our *ngIf on the image. Open app.component.html and add a simple button: (this is the default HTML)

The advantage of Ionic is that if you have knowlegde of some Web Development Framework (e.g.: Angular, React, Vue or pure Javascript), then you can start creating Cross-Platform Mobile Apps right away. This means a reduced learning curve and increased productivity.
My goals in this article are:
Set up a project using Ionic 4 and Angular;
Integrate Google Maps into the project;
Exercise some Maps features like centering, maps inputs and outputs;
The basic dependencies to start your project are: Node.js and Angular. If you do not have Node.js, go here. If you do not have Angular installed, go here. After installing both, you need to install Ionic. Just type:
npm install -g @ionic/cli

  How do reverse shells work?


To make a connection to a typical remote shell, a machine controlled by the attacker connects to the remote network host and it requests a shell connection.
blind shell
But what if the remote host is not directly accessible, like it has public IP or is protected by a firewall?
In this situation reverse shells maybe shouldn&#x27;t be used, where the target machine initiates connection to the listening network host a shell is now established.
To start you need a listener process on their system to listen the reverse shell connections incoming to their IP address, Eg, 12.12.12.12
nc -lvnp 7070

The netcat listener will listen at port 7070. An attacker needs to execute the code to the listener. Many reverse shells needs programming langs

                    <span>Python is a great programming language, it has so many uses, but one thing that it doesn’t do well is help protect your hard work from others. Python source code is plain-text, which means that anyone with access to your files can see what you wrote. Not great when you’ve just written the latest advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) or the best machine learning (ML) algorithm on the planet.
Python has a great feature where it first compiles your source code into bytecode; this is a low-level platform-independent representation of your source code. Back in the days when computers were slow, this was helpful, but when trying to distribute secure code this is a problem. Most solutions for securing Python code involve the distribution of .pyc files. Now, this isn’t all that bad as it doe…</span>

                    <span>While companies increasingly look to cloud computing as a means to expand, modernize and stay competitive, so too do those companies expose themselves to new risks. In fact, Ermetic and IDC report that 80% of CISOs claim their company has had a cloud data breach in the past 18 months. Nearly half of those (43%) had experienced 10 or more breaches.
The benefits of cloud computing are numerous, but organizations cannot make the switch to this modern platform without understanding the risks involved and, more importantly, how to protect themselves, their staff and their customers.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud service provider that’s on almost every company’s radar today. But many AWS customers today wonder what the best approach to security is and how to get there.

                    <span>What is an Azure DevOps Personal Access Token (PAT)?


A personal access token (PAT) is used as an alternative to using a password to authenticate into Azure DevOps. When you&#x27;re working with third-party tools, APIs or the command line that don&#x27;t support Microsoft or Azure AD accounts or you don&#x27;t want to provide your primary credentials to the tool, you can make use of PATs.
PATs are easy to create when you need them and easy to revoke when you don’t.

When creating a new PAT you can select the organization where you want to use the token, and then choose a lifespan for your token. Say for example making it only active and usable for a period of 30 days. A PATs lifetime can be extended if needed, but cannot be longer than the maximum period of 1 year. You can also specify granular permissi…</span>

The average person has to keep track of approximately 100 passwords and spends almost 13 minutes every week resetting those passwords. Due to this friction, password reuse is a major issue with over two-thirds of end users reusing passwords across sites, creating widespread security vulnerabilities. The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) found that credential vulnerabilities are involved in more than 80% of all data breaches. Since password reuse is so common, a single compromised password can endanger multiple accounts. 
Auth0 was the first IAM system to build support for passwordless authentication, and all of these reasons are as pertinent as ever:
Passwords are insecure: users pick insecure passwords and reuse them across sites. Since data breaches are common and they frequently include password information, this creates a situation where more and more sites are vulnerable to hacking attempts.
Passwords are expensive to manage: users forget them, and resetting passwords can be an expensive and time-consuming process.
Passwords negatively impact customer retention: remembering and typing a password, particularly on a phone keyboard, carries friction, and can cause returning customers to abandon the login flow, therefore impacting retention.
We believe that moving away from passwords as an authentication method is key to making the internet safer while reducing friction and positively impacting user acquisition and retention. 
Since our initial release, the authentication industry has been hard at work finding better ways to implement passwordless authentication. For example, the FIDO Alliance successfully led the specification and implementation of WebAuthn. In the last few years, Webauthn has been implemented in all major OS/browsers, with iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 being the latest to join the party in September 2020.

                    <span>The Angular’s Core contains most of the functionalities you might need in your application, while with React and Vue, you have to find external libraries, maintained by independent contributors. Luckily most of the basics one, are maintained by the same people that maintain the core. Therefore, when working with React and Vue, you have to be more careful when choosing libraries, being aware that libraries with a poor maintenance might be deprecated in future.
To build an app with Angular you have to learn Typescript, which is a superset of JavaScript, while with Vue and React you can use pure JS. Regarding the view, with Angular and Vue you write it with HTML, where in React you have to write JSX, which is a syntax that allows coexistence between HTML and JS. Thus, Angular and Vue are idea…</span>

Here&#x27;s a short list of the most notable ones:
A few quick words on my &quot;less than optimal&quot; hardware: I basically had to make do with a small laptop that has definitely seen better days (days that have long since passed, I should probably add) with a freshly installed Ubuntu 20. But I could, of course, connect to my PC at the office over company VPN, as I&#x27;m sure is the case for many of you as well.

It is common knowledge that NAS is a server-type storage system designed to store various information at the file level. In fact, this is a computer with an array of disks inside, which is connected to a network. Every authorized user can interact with any files stored in a NAS. Such storage systems are becoming more and more popular because most of them make use of the RAID technology: It provides a serious boost in fault tolerance and increases security of storing large amounts of data.
