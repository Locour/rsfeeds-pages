It will redirect to other page. Almost all the features of my site is in this manner only. I think angular block the Adsense script and that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t load all the time.

Since the first release, we received great feedback from the community, and we&#x27;ve been working on improving the developer experience using it. In this article, I&#x27;d like to share with you the new features we&#x27;ve introduced, and how to use them.

One of the new features we&#x27;ve introduced is a directive for directly accessing the current route data property from within the component&#x27;s template.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a disorganized person by nature. When I follow a process it&#x27;s by habit and intuition. But when a debugging problem keeps me up at night and gets me to that state of mind where a career of raising sheep in New Zealand seems like an attractive option... That&#x27;s when I need to back off and walk through this process in an orderly fashion. This process never fails. When you walk through it, you can track any problem.
Now I&#x27;m going to skip a lot of common advice. Most debugging tutorials start with things that relate to a process: File an issue, reproduce as a test case etc. I think there&#x27;s plenty written on that online. People use it as filler since they assume debugging is a simple process. It is sometimes. But as we will learn in this blog, there&#x27;s a lot of depth and breadth to this mislea…</span>

But behind our technology is a team of engineers. Until recently, those engineers were focused exclusively on building the best product possible for consumers and individuals. When I was brought on board to lead new initiatives as the Head of Engineering for Grammarly Business and Grammarly for Developers, we knew Grammarly was about to undergo full-on hypergrowth.  
Then the pandemic changed everything. Suddenly, in the midst of hiring and onboarding, we found ourselves transitioning to a remote-first organization. 
Hypergrowth is hard. It’s even harder when a company that values in-person interactions tries to go remote in the middle of a pandemic.

                    <span>Recently a junior developer sent me an obfuscated stack trace and was pretty surprised when I instantly knew the problem and pointed him at the necessary change. To be fair, I had the advantage of being the person who put that bug there in the first place... But still the ability to glean information from a stack trace, even an obfuscated one, is a serious skill.
The stack trace in question was a ClassNotFoundException, that&#x27;s typically pretty easy and already tells you everything you need to know. The class isn&#x27;t there.Why it isn&#x27;t there is really a matter of what we did wrong. In this case since the project was obfuscated the bug was that this class wasn&#x27;t excluded from obfuscation.

                    <span>We&#x27;re thrilled to announce the release of our Syntropy Golang Agent, replacing our previous Python-based agent. This new release is not an alternative option; rather, it&#x27;s a complete refactor from scratch and a replacement going forward. It has all the features and capabilities of the previous agent, with barely any changes from the outside; however, we hope it will provide better performance and more sustainable development in the long term. We won&#x27;t go into why Golang, as you can find zillion articles everywhere on the internet!
As of today, the python agent is deprecated, and all efforts are put into building the best Syntropy Agent in Go. At the moment, it&#x27;s just a stable replica of the former, but new features are to be added.

You know all about phishing. From time to time, emails purporting to be from Facebook or your bank drift into your inbox and insist you “verify your account.” Look closer and you spot the telltale signs of a scam: a sketchy-looking sender address, sloppy writing, and a complete lack of personalization. You sigh and hit delete.
It’s easy to be cynical about opportunistic, mass-mailed phishing attempts. Although some look genuine to even the most cautious eye, others feel decidedly amateurish and are readily identifiable. Billions of emails are sent each month, with over 245,000 phishing-related websites created in January alone according to the Anti-Phish…</span>

                    <span>In November 2021, AWS announced Response Headers Policies — native support of response headers in CloudFront. You can read the full announcement here: Amazon CloudFront introduces Response Headers Policies
I said “native” because previously you could set response headers either using CloudFront Functions or Lambda@Edge.
And one of the common use cases for that was to set security headers. So now you don’t need to add intermediate requests processing to modify the headers: CloudFront does that for you with no additional fee.
Starting from the 3.64.0 version of Terraform AWS provider, you can create the security headers policies and apply them for your distribution.
Let’s see how that looks!

In v2 of the task the error is:

Under the hood the task must be creating a SAS token and then trying to upload to the blob storage. To fix the problem you need to ensure the Service Principal being used has these two roles on the Azure Storage Account:
Storage Account Contributor - &quot;Lets you manage storage accounts, including accessing storage account keys which provide full access to storage account data.&quot;

The above is a basic structure of the curl command. We see the argument

                    <span>The Idea: What Would It Do?


If I could build an app of any kind, the first thing that comes to mind pertains to wait times for ordering food. Just like Disney has wait times for rides, food service places should have wait times for lines to order food. Especially in a college town, time is money, so to limit the amount of time waiting would be priceless. Some could argue order ahead, but that is not always the case or an option for certain establishments.
This application would be used for the time efficient human being, college student, or working class. It really would be used by anyone universally. If you believe time is money, this application is for you.

The restaurant, during business hours, will show up on the application with the wait time if you were to get online and order at …</span>

Focus on quality:
No one wants to watch a lame video. Make sure you make a video that you and your friends would want to watch before you spend the effort and money to promote it. The better the video, the easier it will be to see. Of course it will be hard to do without investment if you want to see guaranteed results. Take note, it&#x27;s easier to buy at https://lowcostsmm.com where views are 100, 1000 or more for your YouTube channel.

                    <span>Flow state is a rare treat for me these days. The last time I can remember being in that zone was working on a GraphiQL implementation for Open Sauced, https://explore.opensauced.pizza. The Open Sauced project makes use of OneGraph, to handle authentication and persisted query features in working with the GitHub GraphQL API. This was the first I had worked on any kind of GraphiQL implementation, so for those of you at the point I was at then, GraphiQL is an Open Source project that can be used to interact with a GraphQL API in an ad-hoc and dynamic way, allowing a developer to iterate quickly on features from a data retrieval standpoint. This post is about the PR #2 in the repo.

Twitter is incredibly easy to automate, in fact, today I&#x27;m going to show you just how easy it is to use the Twitter API with NodeJS to read, search, and post tweets.
Because of the sheer volume of Twitter bots, Twitter requires an application before you can use their API. While you can start using your API key as soon as you submit the application, some features might be restricted until it is reviewed.

                    <span>Whenever we&#x27;re working on any project, It&#x27;s important to have a default formatter set up for your Code Editor.
This will improve your productivity by not wasting time in formatting the code If the line gets longer and does not fit on screen.
Also, using a formatter avoids bugs in your code so you will clearly see where your specific block starts and where it ends and helps to identify matching brackets in the code.
So in this article, we will see how to set up Prettier formatter in Visual Studio Code(VS Code).
So let&#x27;s get started.
Install the Prettier extension for VS Code which formats code written in Javascript, Angular, Vue, React, Typescript and many other languages.

                    <span>About GraphQL


In recent years GraphQL has become very popular due to major advantages it offers against well known REST. Briefly,
It eliminates over fetching &amp; under fetching problems in REST
With GraphQL, we don&#x27;t need to version or api as in REST
GraphQL imposes an opinionated structure which easily leads to standardization whithin teams
Although this article is on creating an api, GraphQL is the best friend of frontend developers. The idea behind is to let the UI component decide its data reqirements and send a query to GraphQL to fetch exactly what it needs.
You can refer to graphql-at-paypal-an-adoption-story for a well detailed story

                    <span>Very recently, AWS announced Vault Lock for AWS backup. This new feature enables the protection of backups from accidental or malicious actions.  Behind the scenes, this extra safeguard is made possible by storing backups using a Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) model. 
The main reason to rehash this? Unique features like this seem to stay under the radar way too often. Secondly, if you already use AWS Backup, then enabling this extra protection is almost effortless.
Here&#x27;s an example of AWS Backup Vault using Locks in CloudFormation:

You know all about phishing. From time to time, emails purporting to be from Facebook or your bank drift into your inbox and insist you “verify your account.” Look closer and you spot the telltale signs of a scam: a sketchy-looking sender address, sloppy writing, and a complete lack of personalization. You sigh and hit delete.
It’s easy to be cynical about opportunistic, mass-mailed phishing attempts. Although some look genuine to even the most cautious eye, others feel decidedly amateurish and are readily identifiable. Billions of emails are sent each month, with over 245,000 phishing-related websites created in January alone according to the Anti-Phish…</span>

You can brand your site easily by supplying your product&#x27;s colors and a logo. This branding applies not only to all your auth pages, but also to any emails that we send (forgotten passwords, email confirmations, user invites, etc.).

Also, this branding includes the URL your customers are on. We support custom domains so your users see your auth pages on https://auth.yourdomain.com, not https://yourname.propelauth.com.

                    <span>A mock of localStorage written in TypeScript


The other day, I started writing mock of localStorage in TypeScript.
Regarding this code, please note that it does not behave completely the same as localStorage.
The behavior is not perfectly reproduced (The value returned when an unintended value is passed, for example), but the basic logic is implemented.
type Store &#x3D; any;

class LocalStorageMock {
  store: Store;
  length: number;

  constructor() {
    this.store &#x3D; {};
    this.length &#x3D; 0;
  }

  key(n: number): any {
    if (typeof n &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;undefined&#x27;) {
      throw new Error(
        &quot;Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute &#x27;key&#x27; on &#x27;Storage&#x27;: 1 argument required, but only 0 present.&quot;
      );
    }

    if (n &gt;&#x3D; Object.keys(this.store).length) {
      return null;
    }

    return Object.…</span>

                    <span>One of the simplest ways to have a rough idea of how long a piece of code is taking to execute is by using the console methods time, timerLog, and timeEnd. 
Example:
console.time(&quot;answer time&quot;);
// where &#x60;answer time&#x60; is a label to identify this timer
alert(&quot;Click to continue&quot;);
console.timeLog(&quot;answer time&quot;);
alert(&quot;Do a bunch of other stuff...&quot;);
console.timeEnd(&quot;answer time&quot;);

Most of the time you just want to time a whole event and don&#x27;t care about intermediate steps, though. Then, you just need console.time, console.timeEnd. 
That&#x27;s pretty much it.</span>

One of the new features we&#x27;ve introduced is a directive for directly accessing the current route data property from within the component&#x27;s template. This is a structural directive that binds the whole data property to the local variable we define. To use it, we need to add a *tdRouteData directive attribute to a tag that we want i…</span>

                    <span>Most software projects start out in English since the majority of terms in software development are in English. The problem is that it is unlikely that every user will be comfortable with your app when it isn’t in a language that they use on a daily basis. This is where internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10) comes in.
The act of localizing an app is a common problem because of the dynamic nature, which stops tools like Google Translate from working. Therefore a large wealth of internationalization tools exists solves the problem in various ways, but in this tutorial I am going to showcase inlang which is a way to ensure type safety in your translations so you never miss a translation again.

                    <span>In this article we are going to talk about the differences between Javascript and Typescript, they are two languages that are widely use nowadays in all types of projects, JS was the first to be introduced as client-side language. As time passed the projects were JS was being used started to be too complex and heavy, thats were TS enters the game, and starts as language to resolve all the problems that JS was having at the moment, nowadays TS is a language widely used also and is becoming bigger and bigger, so I hope that with this article I can help you a little bit to now any differences or to resolve any doubts.

There are many differences, now I&#x27;m going to show you a comprehensible list of differences.
JS is used for client-side mostly while TS is used mostly for both client-side and server-side.
TS has an improved readability, since JS requires a lot of manual detection of bugs and errors, this has been improved a lot by TS.
TS has static typing while JS doesn&#x27;t support it since JS is a dynamically-typed language.
TS supports ES6.
TS has a full support in modern IDE.
TS can also convert its code to JS if necessary.
Using TS means that you can use OOP(Object-oriented programming) principles.
In JS functions are considered an object and they can have its own method and properties.
The choice is up to you at the end on what to choose if you want to work with this languages, you will have to balance the pros and the cons between both of them, and make an educated choice. Usually the option you choose will come from different variables like having in mind the size and complexity of the project you are going to work on, there are more differences between this two languages but the ones I wrote are the main ones and the important ones, I hope you like the article, any queries feel free to comment and ask!</span>

                    <span>I wrote an article on why to use Typescript if you&#x27;re still in doubt about whether to use it in your projects. In short, Typescript allows you to write maintainable code. Javascript works well for prototyping but becomes frustrating when you return to a project again. Suddenly, you see blocks of code where you can&#x27;t understand what kind of data passes there.
In this article, I want to introduce you to Typescript while playing with code. Thus, you see it in action and don&#x27;t overflow with an unnecessary theory. I recommend playing with the code you&#x27;ll meet here in Typescript Playground.

                    <span>As part of promoting DRY (don&#x27;t repeat yourself), MDD (model-driven development), and code generator, I would like to show its full power on a real-life example.
We will implement a simple ToDo app with backend and client app. Let&#x27;s start.
First we will define the project with basic informations.
todo project[
    url www.todo.com 
    namespace com.todo
    version 1 . 0 . 0 . 0
    environments prod
    developer(duskovesin)

Now we will define the #backendpart of the app.
backend server[
        owners(duskovesin)
        template springboot(tests fabut)        
    ]

We are starting with the definition of User and Todo #models, with a few fields and Todo Status #enums.
        UserRole enum(
            ADMIN
            MEMBER

There are a lot of awesome software projects out there that Compose Generator does not support yet. That&#x27;s where you come into play (more about this at the end of the article) …

                    <span>On this post we discuss the necessary IaC (Infrastructure as Code) files to provision an EKS cluster capable of sharing a single GPU between multiple pods (code available here).
If you ever tried to use GPU-based instances with AWS ECS, or on EKS using the default Nvidia plugin, you would know that it&#x27;s not possible to make a task/pod shared the same GPU on an instance. If you want to add more replicas to your service (for redundancy or load balancing), you would need one GPU for each replica.
And this doesn&#x27;t seem to be going to change in the near future for ECS (see this feature request)
GPU-based instances are expensive, and despite the fact that some Machine Learning frameworks (e.g. Tensorflow) are pre-configured to use the entire GPU by default, that&#x27;s not always the case. ML service…</span>

One of the first things we did when we got our laptops was set up our BIOS.

BIOS or Basic Input/Output System is a small piece of code that lives in a “read only” chip on your system board(motherboard).

                    <span>One API ecosystem challenge I&#x27;ve had over the years is quantifying what &quot;good&quot; looks like (I&#x27;ve published that journey on my website, with pieces including &quot;Rethinking NPS for Quality&quot; and &quot;How Reporting Can Backfire&quot; ). Despite most organizations&#x27; desire to be &quot;data-driven&quot;, much of the quality storytelling we do remains anecdotal and story driven.
On the one hand, quantifying abstract concepts like &quot;maturity&quot;, &quot;quality&quot;, or &quot;maintainability&quot; is problematic. On the other hand, quantifiable metrics like &quot;time-to-hello-world&quot; and &quot;uptime percentile&quot; don&#x27;t describe the health of an API ecosystem or whether improvement efforts are improving the speed and safety of overall API development.
I joined Postman in April, just as the company was preparing its latest survey. I saw it as an opportunity to build upon existing industry devops insights by testing whether they also apply to API program performance.
In the 180th Net #API Notes, I deep dive on the Postman 2021 State of the APIs Report; specifically, what are the four behaviors of high-performing API teams? And how do we measure them?

Linux is one of the most popular operating systems in the world. It is Unix-like, and it is also open-source. Quite a big percentage of developers use Linux because it can be customized in so many ways.
What&#x27;s cool about Linux is its command line. Every &#x27;hackers&#x27; paradise. There are a ton of commands. If you aren&#x27;t familiar with any Linux commands, be sure to check out this post on the 8 Linux Commands Everyone Should Know.
There is probably a command for almost anything that you want to do. For example what if you wanted to get the size of a directory? Well luckily for you there is a command for that. In this post, we are going to talk about that command and see what it can offer.

                    <span>Hi there👋,
In this guide we will be learning how to integrate MongoDB in our project using Mongoose.
or the backend of your app)
MongoDB is an open-source document database and leading NoSQL database.
Mongoose is an Object Data Modelling(ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
Instead of connecting our node app directly to MongoDB, we will use Mongoose.


For this guide, we will be storing user info. in our database.
If you&#x27;re working on complete MERN stack then all of these steps are meant to be perform in the backend of your app.)
1. Start with installing Mongoose.
npm install mongoose

2. Create a file userModel.js.
In this file, we will create a userSchema. A schema is the structure of the database.
import mongoose from &quot;mongoose&quot;;

const userSchema &#x3D; new mongoose.Schema(

                    <span>This post illustrates deployment process of Server Side Rendered Angular application, as can be guessed from the title.
Though, AWS has a dedicated service for deploying SSR applications, called  AWS Amplify, but, as of writing this post, Angular Universal is not supported by Amplify. There are multiple other options available to achieve the required result. One of the more popular ones were the usage of a third party API, called Serverless. But, It was particularly challenging for me to find a clean and vanilla solution as I was juggling between different options.
Below, I will demonstrate the usage of AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy Angular SSR.     
Open AWS Management Console and go to Elastic Beanstalk homepage. Click on Create Application.

Next, Give your application a name, and select Platform and Platform branch as illustrated below.

On the same page, proceed with uploading the zipped dist folder of your Angular app which gets generated upon building your app in the local system. Now, click on Configure more options button. 

On the next screen, click on the Edit button on the software tile.
  
Provide the Node Command considering dist as root. The path used in Node Command generally is of the folder where file to be run is placed.

Save the Configuration and click on Create App subsequently. Environment setup will take a few minutes, after which it will provide the Health status, logs and Deployment URL, as, can be seen below.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s see how you can connect to a MySQL database using Node.js, the popular JavaScript runtime environment.


Create a MySQL database



mysql -u USER -p



CREATE DATABASE employees;

USE employees;
Create a table in the database:


CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (    
id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,    
name varchar(50),    
PRIMARY KEY (id)  
);
INSERT INTO employees (nombre) VALUES (&quot;Silvia&quot;);  
INSERT INTO employees (nombre) VALUES (&quot;Luigi&quot;);  
INSERT INTO employees (nombre) VALUES (&quot;Alejandro&quot;);




 


Install node-mysql
You will need to have the node-mysql package installed, so if you don&#x27;t have it installed, you will need to install it. To do this you must use the npm package manager:


npm install mysql



Establish the MySQL connection



var mysql &#x3D; require(&#x27;mysql&#x27;);  
var conexion&#x3D; mysql.createConnection({      
   host : &#x27;localhost&#x27;,

                    <span>💡 What is the best way to apply Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to your ASP.NET Web API? Let&#x27;s find out together.



  
  
  
Role-Based Access Control, also known as RBAC, is one of the most common strategies to restrict access to protected resources within an organization. It simplifies permission assignment by categorizing users in roles. However, many people making their first foray into RBAC have questions:
How can you reflect this user categorization on your application to check users&#x27; privileges?
How can you deal with roles in your code?
Is role control appropriate for Web APIs?
In this article, you will learn the best way to implement RBAC in your ASP.NET Core Web API by using Auth0&#x27;s capabilities.

                    <span>Okta (Auth0) was placed into the Leader Quadrant for 2021, parent company Okta also named a Leader.



  
  
  
We are proud to announce that Auth0, a product unit within Okta, has been recognized as a Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management, Worldwide. Gartner defines the Access Management market as: &quot;The access management (AM) market is defined by customers’ needs to establish, enforce, and manage run-time access controls for internal and external types of identities, as well as machine identities, interacting with cloud, modern standards-based web and legacy web applications&quot; Auth0 focuses on SaaS-delivered developer-centric and Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) use cases.
For more information, please download the full 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management report.

The Magic Quadrant recognized Okta (Auth0) as a Leader based on our Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision.  
Auth0 believes that CIAM should do more to balance the three forces of security, privacy and convenience — not just keeping the bad actors out, but also driving customer loyalty and conversion and revenue to create a great experience for our customers, partners, and their end-users.
We believe vendors&#x27; experience in the space is a key consideration for Gartner in their Magic Quadrant Evaluations. As stated by one of our customers in their review of Auth0, included in the 2021 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer Access Management Report, Auth0 comes with great features out-of-the-box. We went live easily with Auth0 as our Identity Provider. The platform/vendor does not just support us in a technical angle, but also understanding our user journey and sharing their experience (with other clients) and what approaches to take to minimize risk and even enhance user experience during the migration. — VP, Core Product Development, Retail industry

💛 Huge thanks to Teppei Fukuda for reviewing this tutorial.
You’ve adopted continuous integration (CI), followed TDD and BDD principles — having mastered testing, you deploy anytime, at a moment’s notice. You are a CI guru. You can live happily ever after.
Like all fairy tales, the story ends abruptly; before real life intrudes. Before we realize that a vital component has been left out, security.
In this tutorial, I’ll propose ways of integrating security at every stage of your CI/CD workflow. I can’t promise a happy life, but I guarantee you’ll sleep better at night.

                    <span>Why Random Numbers Are Not Random?


The Random Numbers come from a particular seed number which is usually the system clock.Run the program below to understand the security risk.




The Python Documentation also has a warning about the same: &quot;The pseudo-random generators of this module should not be used for security purposes.&quot;
So all the password generators you have built using random module are not secure!? So How do we generate cryptographically secure numbers/passwords?
But there is another line after that warning:
For security or cryptographic uses, see the secrets module.&quot;
The secrets module is used for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets.

There was claims-extraction processing in earlier incarnations as part of the state field construction. In examining the flow, the diagram helps show there is no longer a claims-extraction step. It&#x27;s been isolated from preprocess which means now the logic that enforces the extension secret is missing. We have to decide how to re-enable the verification of the extension secret.

                    <span>I have many different places where I have to use the same logic, so I have generalized my logic system into a class...
...
const contextLayer &#x3D; new contextLayerCore(...useState([]));
...

This class provides me with a bunch of functions like addContext, removeAll, etc. However, the addContext function is a bit problematic...
...
addContext(context: listing) {
  this.setState([...this.state, context]);
}
...

Simple enough; all it does is append an object using the setState function which should re-render any components using the state. Here&#x27;s the problem, this causes an infinite loop...
...
this.setState([...this.state, context]);
//                     ^
// also updates when state updates, hence re-runs the setState function
...

This causes and infinite loop. I could using useEffect(..., []) to make it not be dependant, however, this is a function inside a class, thus it breaks React&#x27;s rules of hooks.
I have to retain the functionality of this class, so I cannot move the function up into the component(s) as a lot of components use this class and would simply create duplicate code.
And example of where it is used...
...

...

What should I do? Is there an alternative of useEffect? Should I be using a different system for this purpose?
Convert it to a custom hook!
export default function useContextLayer (initialState: Array
) {
  const [state, setState] &#x3D; useState(initialState);

  return {
    removeAll: () &#x3D;&gt; {...},
    addContext: () &#x3D;&gt; {...},
    // doesn&#x27;t even need an useEffect anymore
  }

This is the last article in the series and in this final article we will be taking a look how to create a wrapper component for conditional rendering of components based on user permissions.
Why do we need it? Because it is more convenient to wrap a component in a wrapper than to call a hook in every case we need conditional rendering.
Let&#x27;s create an interface to represent the props of our future wrapper component in our models folder:
// ./permissions-validation/models/with-permissions-props.ts
import { ReactElement } from &#x27;react&#x27;;

export interface WithPermissionsProps {
  checkAll?: boolean;
  children: ReactElement;
  permissions?: string | string[];
  placeholder?: JSX.Element;
}

                    <span>Most people have seen them, those immensely long import paths like the example below:
import module from &quot;../../../../../modules/module.ts&quot;;

To improve this, you can use import aliases and make it look like the example
import module from &quot;@/modules/module.ts&quot;;

The benefit of this is readability and that you can move files and folders to sub or parent directories without changing the import paths.
Tools like Vue CLI are supporting this out-of-the-box, but if you want to use the new blazing-fast build tool Vite, you&#x27;ll need to (at the time of writing)
For this to work, all tools need to know that import aliases are used by modifying each tool&#x27;s configuration file.
Vite has a configuration file called vite.config.ts and by adding the resolve object Vite will know that import aliases are being used:
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from &quot;vite&quot;;
import path from &quot;path&quot;;

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      &quot;@&quot;: path.resolve(__dirname, &quot;./src&quot;),
    },
  },
});

By adding a paths object to the compilerOptions inside the tsconfig.json like the example below TypeScript will also know that import aliases are being used:
// tsconfig.json
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    &quot;paths&quot;: {
      &quot;@/*&quot;: [&quot;./src&quot;]
    }
  }
}

At last Jest knows that aliasses are being used by adding the moduleNameMapper to the jest.config.ts configuration file like the code below:
// jest.config.ts
module.exports &#x3D; {
  moduleNameMapper: {
    &quot;^@/(.*)$&quot;: &quot;/src/$1&quot;,
  },
};</span>

                    <span>Before digging into the details, let me first do a very quick introduction to what GraphQL is.
GraphQL is a query language designed to build client applications by providing an intuitive and flexible syntax and system for describing their data requirements and interactions.
GraphQL does not mandate a particular programming language or storage system for application services that implement it. Instead, application services take their capabilities and map them to a uniform language, type system, and philosophy that GraphQL encodes.
This provides a unified interface friendly to product development and a powerful platform for tool-building.

With Angular 8, the Builders API was released, and it includes the ability to override commands such as ng build, ng test, and ng lint. Not to be confused with Angular Schematics, which can be used to add custom commands to ng generate or provide support for ng add.
We introduced the workspace file (angular.json) in the Angular CLI about a year ago, and we reworked several key principles of how its commands were implemented as a result. We ended up placing the following commands in boxes:

  What is Node JS?


Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js is a popular, lightweight web framework for beginners, and it is used by many big companies like Netflix and Uber.


  
  
  What is NPM?


NPM is the default package manager for Node.js projects. NPM includes a command-line tool (CLI) that give you access to the NPM package registry. The registry stores the numerous JavaScript packages made available through the NPM CLI, along with their…</span>

First, we must install python3 and pip, together with some other dependencies:
$ sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
$ pip3 install distro jsonschema PyYAML

Then install kas; I had a problem with a dependency so I had to install another package by hand
$ pip3 install testresources
$ pip3 install kas

As an example, we can try to build a simple image for the qemu machine which is already contained in the poky
kas-project.yml, which will describe how our distribution must be built
$ mkdir kas-pine64
$ touch kas-project.yml

Add the following snippet to the project configuration file:

                    <span>Firebase is a service provided by Google where the back end is provided as a service for use in applications. Its database (Firebase Realtime Database) is a NoSQL database where data is stored in JSON like documents. In this tutorial, you&#x27;ll learn how to build an Angular application using Firebase as backend. So, let&#x27;s get started.
Let&#x27;s start by setting up Firebase by signing into the Firebase console. 

Click on the Add project to create a new project. 
You&#x27;ll be prompted to enter a name for your project. We&#x27;ll be naming our project js-scrambler-demo. Next, it&#x27;ll ask you whether to enable Google Analytics for this project or not. We’ll disable it since it&#x27;s not required for this tutorial and click on Create project.

                    <span>A VPN can be a lot of things. You might think you know what a VPN is…but do you really? A virtual private network just sends private traffic over a public network. But where is that traffic going, and for what purpose? After all, networks come in all shapes and sizes.
In this two-part tutorial, we will discuss four “types” of VPN’s, which could just be considered use cases, and set them up with WireGuard® and Netmaker, a free networking platform, in under 10 minutes:
Personal (Private Browsing)


Remote Access


Site-to-Site


Mesh (virtual LAN/WAN)



WireGuard® is a new and very fast VPN technology. Usually, VPN’s make your internet slower. With WireGuard®, the difference is negligible. Netmaker uses WireGuard® under the hood, and can simplify setting up environments from homelab to ente…</span>

                    <span>In this simple tutorial, I will be explaining how to configure your windows subsystem for Linux efficiently and optimize your WSL performance when you&#x27;re running applications through them.
 Everyone has widespread access to windows but they may or maynot be savvy enough to run their favorite flavour of linux due to various constraints
WSL2 really makes life easy for those devs who can&#x27;t access linux through a cloud provider or locally run it on their devices.
WSL has support for various distros like Debian, Arch and Ubuntu.
Now coming to the interesting part, windows has all access to the CPU and memory resources in your device and it is built in a way which will optimize the resource utilization but how do you limit your linux subsystem, let  us say you&#x27;d like to manipulate the configuration to suit your needs the best, then you should follow these steps.
Shut your current running instance of WSL using this command
wsl --shutdown

Run this command through powershell as administrator
Create a configuration file for WSL on your user profile directory
notepad &quot;$env:USERPROFILE\.wslconfig&quot;

 This is the most important step in this project, so please follow carefully 
The following parameters define their corresponding resources:
CPU  &#x3D; &gt; cores dedicated to WSL
Memory  &#x3D; &gt; RAM allocated to WSL
AutoMount  &#x3D; &gt; Mount your default NTFS drive to your subsystem
Boot &#x3D;&gt; defines your booting options for services
Kernel  &#x3D; &gt; Custom kernel for linux
LocalhostForwarding  &#x3D; &gt; for port-forwarding your applications running on localhost
My configuration for CPU and memory:
[wsl2]
memory&#x3D;9GB  
processors&#x3D;4

This is how you can configure your resources for WSL 😀. Feel free to leave some comments down below⬇️.
