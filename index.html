And, if we need to do it again, we oblige. But if we have to do the same repeatedly, the process soon becomes inefficient. And when that time comes, we find a way to automate it.

First we will tell the Travis we need a copy of docker running.
Now, we need to build the image based on the Dockerfile.dev which is the Dockerfile used for development purpose.
Next we write some script which guides Travis how to run our test suite.
If we are hosting our code to AWS, we also tell Travis to do so (which I do not cover now)

Understanding of AWS CDK (Cloud development kit)
Understanding of AWS Custom resources
CDK provides a library for conveniently writing custom resources.
As a custom resource author, you can focus on the actual logic for the custom resource and let CDK take care of other boilerplate stuff. Eg- you do not need to worry about sending the response back to the pre-signed S3 URL. Just return PhysicalResourceId using the return statement and you are good to go. Consequently it also makes your code …</span>

How to implement Builder Pattern in Node.js
When we want to create complicated object which has multiple parts, we can use Builder Pattern that separates the building of these parts. This creational process does not care about how these parts are assembled.
In this tutorial, we&#x27;re gonna look at 2 ways to implement Builder Pattern in Node.js:
using Builder function
using Builder class

En la Actualidad a menudo pensamos en microservicios a la hora de hacer nuevas implementaciones o desarrollos. Este tipo de arquitecturas tiene bastantes ventajas a comparacione de aplicaciones monoliticas, pero asi mismo tambien tiene varios problemas que si no sabemos manejarlos podrian ocasionar problemas importantes en la alta disponibilidad de los Microservicios

I&#x27;ve been a dedicated front end engineer for 5 of my 8 years of professional development. So I&#x27;ve really only ever cared about one letter of these acronyms (and for LAMP I actually have zero investment).

Notifications sound tricky, though, don&#x27;t they?
Well, they don&#x27;t have to be. We can use Netlify Functions, along with some email-sending service, to make that process a walk in the park.

On many occasions, I was asked to build a full-scale app to replace the Excel file once it becomes too risky for the business to keep relying on a spreadsheet.
Like with every project, you have to go through several steps to produce a reliable service:

                    <span>There is more to developing a component than making sure the component looks and works the way it should. Components are a huge portion of what our SPA is made up of so we should consider each component&#x27;s performance, usability, readability, and more. This will help make sure our code stays maintainable and performant over time.
For the user&#x27;s sake, we want the component to be as performant as it can be. The SPA&#x27;s job is to quickly render the data provided by the backend systems. Achieving this can be suppl…</span>

                    <span>Working with small businesses over the years, I saw a lot of them working and managing critical business processes using Excel files that start small but quickly grow out of proportion. 
On many occasions, I was asked to build a full-scale app to replace the Excel file once it becomes too risky for the business to keep relying on a spreadsheet.
Like with every project, you have to go through several steps to produce a reliable service:
Design the data model based on the excel file.

                    <span>When you use hooks, you can write them in their own file. And you could test them.
Tests are not the answer, but they protect your code from changes, they help to find bugs.
If you have a display component with all the logic in a custom hook, it would be a better idea to test the custom hook.
If you have all specs but you doesn&#x27;t know how to design it, may be a good time to use TDD.
In short, saying  : &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to solve that&quot; and stash it, it&#x27;s a bad habit for a developer (and others people too).

I was working with React Projects for a long time. I have evolved a mindset that allows you to abuse HOC to make code more reusable and somewhat clean. But when I got into Angular, it felt weird at first that there is no such concept.
At some point, I got in touch with Modals and there it was the gong that awoke the ninja in me. First, I dove again into angular.io docs and indeed found a way to pass components through @Input() and render them. But that was unsatisfying because of the decorator. …</span>
