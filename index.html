                    <span>Any starter node.js enthusiastic would at least one time ponder, how can a single thread system out perform better than a MultiThreaded system.
And specially many people from multithreaded pardigm, who are evaluating/understading node.js,  would rather find it hard to understand : why Node.js(or any single threaded non blocking JS system) is acclaimed better than multi-threaded system (At least for serving web-traffic!)?
Node.JS is not faster (doesnot means its slower either), but rather highly efficient in handling a single thread, as compared to a blocking multi-threaded system handling its single thread!
I have made diagrams to explain this statement with analogies.


A multi-threaded blocking system is not capable of utilizing its threads power to its full potential, as a thread is blocked until it evaluates each line of code.
Now offcourse one can build a non blockig system on top of a blocking multi-threaded system (thats what Node.js is under the hood), but its very complex. And you have to do it ever where you need non blocking code in your application or program.
Javascript ecosystem (like nodejs) provide this out of the box as its syntax. The JS language sytanx provide all this feature where ever needed. Morever as its part of its syntax, the reader of the code immeditetly knows that where code is blocking and where its non-blocking.
The blocking part of multithreaded-blocking system makes it less efficient. The thread which is blocked cannot be used for anything else, while its waiting for response.
While a non-blocking single threaded system makes best use of its single thread system.
And hence node.js if used properly can out perform many multi-threaded systems.</span>

The destroyAfterEach Angular testing module teardown option addresses several long-time issues when using the Angular testbed:
The host element is not removed from the DOM until another component fixture is created
Component styles are never removed from the DOM
Application-wide services are never destroyed
Feature-level services using the any provider scope are never destroyed
Angular modules are never destroyed
Components are destroyed 1 time less than the number of tests
Component-level services are destroyed 1 time less than the number of tests
The two first issues have the biggest impact when using Karma which runs the component tests in a browser.

Overview of AngularJS

It is undoubtedly a largely used JavaScript framework that allows you to execute client web apps in browsers and create native apps. Angular apps consist of various components written with TypeScript or JavaScript. These are decorated with directives for handling things such as binding the HTML or markup to data. Your codes written with Angular will not run directly on web browsers. Therefore, you need compilers to change your code to something which the browsers can easily run.
As Angular 9 uses the Ahead-of-time compiler for transforming the code as a part of the publishing process, the browser can ea…</span>

Here is a Portuguese version.
In my ongoing project, I have a CI/CD flow and one step is responsible to collect the code coverage and validate if I have the minimal value to proceed to another step.
However, even having 84% of code coverage, the SonarQube always returned 30% of the result in the step, because of that the deployment step was never executed. 
I spent some time understanding that the problem was in the Lombok annotations, the SonarQube was computing the generated code.
It&#x27;s simple to resolve this issue. I created a file named lombok.config inside the folder java (/../src/main/java/lombok.config) with this:
config.stopBubbling &#x3D; true
lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation &#x3D; true

The config.stopBubbling informs the Lombok that the folder where the file is the root and the Lombok don&#x27;t need to search for more parent folders.
While lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation  put in every generated code by Lombok annotation, another one named @lombok.Generated. This annotation informs Jacoco to not collect coverage from those codes.
Done, problem solved!

When I teach or lecture and mention security I always love the analogy of security as an Onion. This is a common cliché yet it’s still a powerful analogy for people who are new to the concepts. The equivalent analogy I would pick for remote debugging is like leaving your front door open with all your valuables piled in easy to spot and well labeled boxes. Calling JDWP insecure doesn’t make any sense. It wasn’t designed to be secure so it isn’t...
Java Debug Wire Protocol (AKA JDWP) was designed for testing internally. Over the past few years I’ve run into quite a few individuals that made the mistake of leaving it on even in production!

                    <span>This new Malware family is up to no good:






A very clever malware designed with 3 components: - trojanized applications, - backdoors, and - rootkits. 🐞
It employs a rootkit to conceal its presence and uses different command and control servers for each sample, maintaining a low profile on your system as if nothing is happening will it cause havoc.
It is designed to launch and mediate access to a local SSH server, update itself, and transmit collected credentials. 🔒
FontOnLake is capable of file manipulation, updating itself, and uploading and downloading files
It accepts remote connections, serves as a proxy and can download and run Python scripts, in addition to exfiltrating credentials.
Surprisingly, this malware targets the one who is immune to most viruses, Linux
And the most scary part is that, it is still under development (and it is this deadly ☠️)

Yani A domaininden B domainine trust oluşturulursa A domaini üzerindeki admin, B domaini kullanıcıları ve gruplarına erişebilir ve A domaini içerisindeki kaynakları kullanmaları için gerekli yetkileri bu kullanıcı ve gruplara sağlayabilir.
Her iki samba DC&#x27;nin de zaman ayarı doğru olmalıdır.

Database types are patterns and structures used to organize data.
The beginnings of database types go back to the early-60s, and through the years these technologies experienced an amazing development. Some of these historic types have served as the base to advanced database technologies, however, new types have been developed to solve new issues and requirements in modern DBMS. In 1969, relational databases were introduced. This database type worked with tables, having primary keys and foreign keys that connect each table. Like this, tables can org…</span>

  So what is docker?


Docker is lovely developer tool that makes it easy to install and run software without worrying about setup and dependencies.
This is because it makes containers, imagine a multi layer cake where you take a verticle slice of it, so you take from each layer a portion but you don&#x27;t care about the rest of the slices. Here is an illustration for it.

Which makes it easy for microservices, one example that we will be seeing soon is deploying multiple services with different environemnts or maybe different versions of the very same dependency, like different nodejs versions.
This is my favorite part, where it&#x27;s enough with the talking and we start to write some code!!

Web Scraping is a way to collect all sorts of publicly available data like prices, text, images, contact information and much more from the world-wide-web. This can be useful when trying to collect data that might take a person a lot of time to collect and organize manually.
Some of the most useful use cases of web scraping include:
Scraping product prices from e-commerce websites such as amazon, ebay or alibaba.


Scraping social media posts, likes, comments, followers or bios.


Scraping contacts from websites like yellowpages or Linkedin.

Node.js is now a must, so it is essential for a developer to master it.
I will publish a new article every two days and little by little you will learn everything there is to know about Node.js

In this section we will do a little theory and find out how NodejS executes its JavaScript code.
As you know, NodeJS allows to execute asynchronous code. This concept may seem simple but in the background it is a bit more complicated. What determines what code is executed? What determines the order of execution?
Understanding these concepts is essential for developing with NodeJS. No need to become an expert on the subject but at least under…</span>

                    <span>Images are an important part of every website. They help convey meaning and emotion, and they can make any design more attractive—or less, depending on how you use them. So whether it&#x27;s photographs, illustrations or renders, getting good images is an important step in web development.
Using screenshots is a common practice, especially for web developers showcasing their work in a portfolio; but the most popular screen capturing tools don&#x27;t allow for much customization, so the quality of the resulting images may not be good enough. Thankfully, there are other tools; like Puppeteer, which does allow for plenty of customization.
Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. Puppeteer runs headless by default, but can be c…</span>

Cross-Site Request Forgery (abbreviated as CSRF or XSRF) is an exploit which tricks a web application into sending a malicious request on behalf of an authenticated user. It is also known as one-click attack, session riding, hostile linking, or cross-site reference forgery. This allows an attacker to trick a web application into executing any actions of their choosing as if they were the authenticated user. 
Fundamentally, a CSRF attack relies on user&#x27;s identity on a given web application and the web application&#x27;s server&#x27;s trust in that identity. As the attacker does not receive the response of the malicious request, only requests with side effect …</span>

If you want to expose an API publicly on the Internet, authorization will be a requirement for you sooner or later. You want to verify that the client consuming the API has the appropriate permissions.
This guide is exactly about that. We&#x27;ll be securing an API written using Ruby On Rails, with Auth0 as the authorization server.
There&#x27;s a repository with the code so that you can follow along in Github.
I didn&#x27;t explain what I mean by securing an API yet. Essentially, we&#x27;re ensuring that protected routes are accessible only for the users with enough rights.
When it comes to security, it&#x27;s generally considered a bad idea to roll your own bespoke implementation. Instead, I&#x27;m using OAuth, a …</span>

When I teach or lecture and mention security I always love the analogy of security as an Onion. This is a common cliché yet it’s still a powerful analogy for people who are new to the concepts. The equivalent analogy I would pick for remote debugging is like leaving your front door open with all your valuables piled in easy to spot and well labeled boxes. Calling JDWP insecure doesn’t make any sense. It wasn’t designed to be secure so it isn’t...

The urge towards adopting microservices architecture has been a welcome trend in the software development industry.  Microservices architecture has been one of the most talked-about technologies in recent times – it has been embraced by many leading organizations worldwide. Originally developed to solve the limitations of monolithic systems, microservices architecture has seen a significant increase in popularity over the last several years, mainly due to increased scalability, flexibility, and performance.
Since microservices-based applications comprise several different services, you often need a common interface or gateway to call these services so that you define and manage all concerns in …</span>

This post outlines what they are, how to identify the different types of keys, where you&#x27;re likely to find them across the different services, and the order of access precedence for the different SDKs and tools.
AWS Access Keys are credentials used to authenticate to the AWS APIs. Any time you execute the aws command line tools, or use any kind of tool or script that interacts with AWS, access keys are what you use to identify yourself to AWS. They&#x27;re tied to an IAM principal - either an IAM user or an IAM role. There are, broadly speaking, two primary types of access keys:

Most applications require authentication for gaining access to restricted information or perform tasks. If adequate security is not in place, malicious users can circumvent the authentication process and gain access to these pages by simply skipping the login page and directly calling an internal page that is supposed to be accessed only after authentication has been performed. By directly browsing to the below listed pages without logging in, we are able to access and view its content without logging into the application.
Solution :
Implement session management to ensure that only users logged into the system and with
appropriate access levels are allowed access to the file.
Check for the AUTH token to ensure only proper users logged into the system.

It&#x27;s just another view on variables and methods naming convention. You know, basically some guy on the internet telling you: do this instead of that. 
You should use verbs like is or should in selectors. Consider selectors as questions. Nouns like car, admin or more complex sentences like affirmative statement displayAdsSection are answers to those questions. Below example:
const displayAdsSection &#x3D; useSelector(shouldDisplayAdsSection);

if (displayAdsSection) {
    return ;
}

Let&#x27;s do a little experiment on the beginning to better understand the problem. Assume that we turned the title of this post into something what you could find in a real project code, like this:

                    <span>Do you think this is a good usage of map in terms on readability / performance?
Lets say I&#x27;m making a list of notes but only allow 1 per day, You have a list of your notes:
[
{id: 1, date: &quot;2021-10-12&quot;, content: &quot;hello world!&quot;}, 
{id: 2, date: &quot;2021-10-13&quot;, content: &quot;hope you have a great day!&quot;}
]

We have a text field and a submit button, on click we call upsertNote() which will update the array if it&#x27;s the same day or will add a new record i.e:
usertNote({date: &quot;2021-10-13&quot;, content: &quot;how you get through today!&quot;})
// output:
{id: 2, date: &quot;2021-10-13&quot;, content: &quot;how you get through today!&quot;}

usertNote({date: &quot;2021-10-14&quot;, content: &quot;Future me!&quot;})
// output:
{id: 3, date: &quot;2021-10-14&quot;, content: &quot;future me!&quot;}

Notice how one updates the existing entry and the other creates a new one. 
Now lets say we want to add to our existing list. We could do a search on the array for the id but what if we used a Map instead? 
Is that better in terms on readability and performace?
e.g.
const toDoList &#x3D; new Map(originalArray.map((i) &#x3D;&gt; [i.id, i]))
const upsertToDoEntry &#x3D; usertNote({date: &quot;2021-10-14&quot;, content: &quot;Future me!&quot;})

toDoList.set(upsertToDoEntry.id, upsertToDoEntry)

// In our react if we wanted to map these out we&#x27;d have to do something like this:
Array.from(toDoList , ([id, toDoEntry]) &#x3D;&gt; (
{toDoEntry.content}
)

Would you implement it this way? :)</span>

We’ve all been in situations where we used a library that had been typed sparingly. Take the following third-party function, for example:
function describePerson(person: {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  hobbies: [string, string]; // tuple
}) {
  return &#x60;${person.name} is ${person.age} years old and love ${person.hobbies.join(&quot; and  &quot;)}.&#x60;;
}

If the library doesn’t provide a standalone type for the person argument of describePerson, defining a variable beforehand as the person argument would not be inferred correctly by TypeScript.
const alex &#x3D; {
  name: &#x27;Alex&#x27;,
  age: 20,
  hobbies: [&#x27;walking&#x27;, &#x27;cooking&#x27;] // type string[] !&#x3D; [string, string]
}

describePerson(alex) /* Type string[] is not assignable to type [string, string] */

                    <span>When a method [on a child class] is marked with override, TypeScript will always make sure that a method with the same name exists in a the base class.
Typescript Handbook
The override keyword has been a long running feature of languages such as Java and C++, and since version 4.3, is now implemented in Typescript! 🎉
As the top quote explains, the override keyword will assert that the function it describes is present in the parent class. This will help cut down on typos, and can give you a heads up if you were not aware that a function was changed/removed in the parent class.
abstract class Animal {
  public sleep() {
    // some default logic
  }

  public eat() {
    // some default logic
  }
}

class Unicorn extends Animal {
  public override sleep() {
    // some new logic
  }

  // Error! The method &#x60;eats&#x60; does not
  // exist in the parent class!
  public override eats() {
    // some new logic
  }
}

This is an example of implementing the wrong function due to a typo, and Typescript catching it for you before runtime!
If you&#x27;d like to make marking overridden methods with override required, you can enable the noImplicitOverride options in your tsconfig.json.
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    // ...
    &quot;noImplicitOverride&quot;: true
  }
}

Now, Typescript will throw an error if an overridden method does not include the override keyword.
I hope you learned a bit about the override keyword! If you have any questions, corrections, or addons, I would love to hear them. Peace ✌</span>

On my previous post MERN client-side I have talked about a MERN client application with React, Typescript and the use of RxJs as an observables solution to collect and subscribe api response data.
As we know Redux is a state manager container for JavaScript apps. It is a robust framework that allows you to have state control and information in all components/containers of your application. It works like a flow with a single store, it can be used in any environment like react, angular 1/2, vanilla etc.
And to support the use of Redux in React we also have React-Redux. A library that allow us to keep Redux solution up to date with React modern approaches. Through React Hooks from React-Redux we can access and control the store. Is without saying that without React-Redux I would …</span>

The proposed Finite State Machine is strictly coupled to the UI of the People list. It allows:

to change the filter (composed by the query and the employment type)

                    <span>A well-designed microservices architecture is an amazing thing. When each service is responsible for its own specific domain and can be deployed independently, it allows for unparalleled flexibility and productivity for backend teams. However, very few decisions are all benefit with no cost - including our decision to choose microservices over a monolithic backend. 
Before we migrated our backend to GraphQL, one trade-off that we encountered was the additional complexity that it imposed on our client-side networking code - especially when we had to create views that used data from multiple services.
For example, our application had a &quot;appointment list&quot; view that looked a little something like this:

In a monolithic architecture, the networking code for this page could be trivial. It would …</span>

                    <span>The Shopping List project is open source and you can find it on GitHub.
There, you are going to find instructions on how to build it and how to run it locally.
The frontend is written in Angular and the backend in Quarkus. The database is PostgreSQL. They are deployed as containers on Heroku and the HTTP communication is protected by JWT tokens.
I describe the technique used to deploy them as containers on Heroku in this article on medium.
You can access this demo version running on Heroku and try it right now. But as this is only a demo, please don&#x27;t use a real password there!
The application get dormant after some time without use, so the first access can take some extra time.

Shopping List is a web application that was created especially for mobile devices.
You&#x27;ll be able to organize the products you want to buy and do your shopping more quickly.
Once you create one account, you can create shopping lists and add products to them.
When you&#x27;re buying products at the market, you can check the products updating your list and switch from one shopping list to other very easily.
You can, for instance, create one shopping list for fruits, other for cleaning products and another for grocery. So, in the top menu, you will be able to switch between these shopping lists while you&#x27;re checking the products you already bought.

Application
API swagger
I used Angular Material and Angular Flex-Layout in this project.
On the Quarkus project I used Hibernate Panache to control the database and SmallRye JWT to protect the endpoints.
Perhaps you can find it interesting the Swagger-UI, created automatically by the SmallRye OpenAPI, that has the possibility of doing one Authentication to test the endpoints protected by JWT.

  Generic CRUD Model


Once we have walked about the theory of generics (Part 1) and we have understand the main CRUD methods (Part 2), now it&#x27;s time to see it in action.
Before start to implement the generic service of CRUD. We must define the generic model of all resources.
In this article, we assume that all models have some common properties like id, createdAt, and updatedAt.
Thus, we create a generic abstract class that contains all these common properties.

As I always say, Directives are a really powerful feature of Angular. It can be used as an elegant solution to implement a lot of cool functionalities. You can clearly see why the directive approach makes more sense when you reach the end of the post.
Even though it&#x27;s not that often we see heatmaps in tables, but heatmaps can really add some value in terms of visualization. It would make sense in data sets where there is some kind of comparison or range.

If you have this question in mind, here are some reasons which justify why creating a directive for implementing this feature will make sense.

                    <span>A Story Told Over and Over


I&#x27;ve been a part of a number of different Angular front end projects in the past years. In every one of those projects, there came a point in time where we were asked to implement:
When a call to the backend fails due to authentication errors (401), route the user to the login page.
It didn&#x27;t take long until another use case arrived:
When a call to the backend fails, alert the user of the failure with a generic &quot;The requested operation failed&quot;.
Soon after, another use case:
When the user tries to get the information of an existing contact, and the operation fails, display a toast &quot;Contact not found&quot;.
This would escalate further when the same operation failure would need a different error handling when done from different components. 
If the user tries to edit a…</span>

                    <span>In this blog post we are going to be deploying a Nextjs application to an SSH server using GitHub action.
step 1:
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-yarn

step 2:
   &quot;build&quot;: &quot;next build &amp;&amp; next export&quot;,

Adding the next export enables next to build and store them in out folder, containing the static html of your app.
Note you can&#x27;t using next methods like getServerSideprops or next image optimization with next export.
step 3:
name: nextjs-blog

  push:
    branches: main
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    name: Build and deploy next site
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

                    <span>Merhabalar, bugün benim de karşılaşmış olduğum ufak bir sorunun çözümünü sizlere sunacağım. Umarım faydalı olur.
Bu hata ile karşı karşılaşanlar genelde aşağıdaki iki komutu çalıştırdığında karşılaşmakta:
hostnamectl
timedatectl
Komutlar çalıştırıldığında ise aşağıdaki gibi bir output döndürmekteler.

Bu sorunu çözebilmek için öncelikle dbus adlı servisin çalıştığından emin olunmalıdır.
systemctl status dbus

Eğer bu komut sonrası dönüt aşağıdaki gibi ise servisin bulunmadığını söylemektedir.

Bu durumda aşağıdaki komut ile servis yüklenir:
apt install dbus

Sonrasında servis otomatik olarak active hale gelmiş olabilir. Yine de kesinlik kazandırmak için servisi başlatmalı ve &quot;enable&quot; hale getirmeliyiz. Böylelikle makine her başladığında çalışır duruma gelebilmektedir.
systemctl start dbus
systemctl enable dbus

Eğer &quot;systemctl status dbus&quot; komutunun dönütü aşağıdaki gibi ise servis bulunmakta fakat aktif olmadığı anlamına gelmektedir.

Servis aktif edilir:
systemctl start dbus

Böylelikle dbus servisi sorunu çözümlenmiş olur. Eğer bu işlemlere rağmen çözüm sağlanılmamış ise bunun sebebi /var/run ile /run arasındaki gerekli symbolic linkin bozulmuş olması olabilir. Bunun için aşağıdaki komutlar çalıştırılır ve servisin durumuna bakılır:
sudo rm /var/run -R
sudo ln -s /run /var
sudo reboot</span>

We think a lot about login boxes. 
But you would be surprised by just how much your customers are thinking about them as well.
Now, we would say that, since we are in the business of making login boxes. So that’s why we went out and asked people what they thought: more than 17,000 global technology leaders and consumers across 12 global markets: United States, United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Singapore, Japan, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.
The survey report, called “Expectation vs. Reality at The Log Inn,” and conducted in partnership with third-party research firm YouGov, revealed that most organizations fail to meet consumer expectations around login experiences.

                    <span>TLDR; Jump to the conclusions.
We have been told that a robust static type system can reduce the number of bugs in our applications, transforming a 2 a.m. production issue into a red squiggly in our text editor. This is an appealing proposition.
In this post, we will set the stage with some definition, a scenario, and a goal and see how this little adventure goes. We will then try to draw some conclusions.
A dynamic type system is a system where types are checked at runtime.
A static type system is a system where types are checked at compile time.
Let&#x27;s imagine that our code needs a simple function that returns the last element of an array (let&#x27;s call it &quot;last&quot;).
Our goal is to have a system that would warn us if we try to call this function with anything other than an array and also ensur…</span>

Let’s first generate a simple React project by using create-react-app. Execute the following command:
npx create-react-app hep-demo --template typescript &amp;&amp; cd hep-demo

Start the app and see if everything is working properly:
yarn start

If you encounter a issue with &quot;babel-jest&quot;: &quot;^26.6.0&quot; add a .env file with SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK&#x3D;true (echo &#x27;SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK&#x3D;true&#x27; &gt; .env )
Now that our app is working we can start by adding the needed packages. 
To install the packages, execute the following command:
yarn add @spotify/prettier-config @typescript-eslint/parser husky lint-staged prettier -D

We will use the eslint config of airbnb to do that execute the following command:

                    <span>Hi Developers! How are you? I hope everyone is well. A few weeks ago I begin to investigate in depth how decorators really work. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;ve never worked with Decorators, of course I have, especially Angular and Nest, but I never bothered to understand how they work. So I decided to get down to let&#x27;s do it. And the truth is, it is easier than it seems.
A decorator is nothing more than a &quot;typical&quot; Javascript/Typescript function what to add additional functionalities to a declaration. When we say declaration, we mean classes, methods, parameters, accessor (getter) and properties. Now, we are going to explain each one of them.
Note: You will have noticed, that at no time did we mention functions, this is so because the main problem is dealing with the elevation of functions. Any attemp…</span>

ng add @angular/material

Import indigo-pink theme to application. Add following line to styles.scss




@import &quot;~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css&quot;;

                    <span>In this tutorial, we will learn how to manage object in FormControl and handle conversion for input
Generally we use FormControl with either string or boolean types and hence it manages only simple values. But what if we want to manage just more than primitive data types? We can do that, let’s see how.
For example, in this tutorial we will learn how to get country-code and number as separate entities from the same form-control, and we will also create custom input for the same to handle the conversion between UI and value.
Let’s assume that we have a Telephone class, which will hold the related values:
export class Telephone {
  constructor(
    public countryCode: string,
    public phoneNumber: string
  ) {}
}

Next, let’s take an input[type&#x3D;tel] in which we want to hold the Telephone:

                    <span>I was playing around and testing some stuff in Linux when i suddenly did a tweak which changed how my WSL terminal opens up. This is what my terminal looks like - notice it doesn&#x27;t the distinct green + blue colors.

After some searching I found two articles (links at the bottom) which describes the &quot;sequence&quot; which Unix follows when reading files. As summary, here&#x27;s the files (in order):
/etc/profile
~/.bash_profile
~/.bash_login
4 ~/.profile
I added the function for .bashrc at the top of the .bash_profile:
## Loads .bashrc
if [[ -f ~/.bashrc ]] ; then
        . ~/.bashrc
fi

Closed terminal and reopened it 

Adding this great explanation from the reference link:
By default, Terminal starts the shell via /usr/bin/login, which makes the shell a login shell. On every platform (not just Mac OS X) bash does not use .bashrc for login shells (only /etc/profile and the first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile that exists and is readable). This is why &quot;put source ~/.bashrc in your .bash_profile&quot; is standard advice
Why doesn&#x27;t .bashrc run automatically?
How do I set up my shell execution PATH?

What is the difference between .bash_profile and .bashrc?</span>

                    <span>This blogpost is about doing buffered writes to a linux filesystem, and latency fluctuations that it could show you, especially when performing a lot of writes, and other implications.
The first thing to discuss is buffered writes. Any write to a linux local filesystem is done &#x27;buffered&#x27;, unless explicitly defined it not to, which is done by opening the file with the O_DIRECT flag. So all file interactions from the shell likely are done buffered, and the Postgresql database is also using buffered IO.
What happens when you perform a buffered write is that you don&#x27;t actually write to the disk, but instead you write to memory. Because currently the latency of most disk IO/writes is still much higher than memory IO latency (~ 25us/modern SSD vs 160ns/memory, although very configuration specifi…</span>

But, it doesn’t mention the day of the week.  The answer happens to be Friday. And, if you make it to the end of this article, I will show you how I used the command line to find out the answer.
In honor of Indigenous People’s Day, I figured I would use a little bit of history to teach you about a topic you’re probably not interested in. The command line interface.

To be able to completely compromise a server, you have to understand the theory of a web server and its architecture.

                    <span>RxJS is a powerful library for reactive programming. We use it in Angular all the time, from simple reactions to HTTP client responses to full-blown state management solutions. But sometimes, it is easy to miss some details and create a code that can break at the worst possible moment. 
Let’s start with an example right away.
of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  .pipe(
    tap(v &#x3D;&gt; {
      if (v &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 3) {
        throw new Error(&#x27;some error&#x27;);
      }
    })
  )
  .subscribe({
    next: console.log.bind(null, &#x27;next:&#x27;),
    error: (err: Error) &#x3D;&gt; console.log(&#x27;error:&#x27;, err.message),
  });

We have an observable that emits numbers from 1 to 5, and if the number is 3, we throw an error.
We can see the following output.
next: 1
next: 2
error: some error

Numbers 4 and 5 were not processed at all.

                    <span>Um dos grandes problemas que enfrentei ao atualizar o frontend de aplicações angular foi o cache. 
Praticamente todos os navegadores mantêm um cache da aplicação no computador do cliente para conseguir carregar a aplicação de forma mais rápida e com menor consumo de dados e isso é excelente. Entretanto, um efeito colateral é que as atualizações podem demorar para serem entregues para o cliente. Como consequência, o cliente pode ficar horas ou dias com uma versão com um bug que já foi corrigido.
Em sistemas internos de empresas, isso pode resultar em ligações ou tickets constantes para a equipe de suporte técnico, causando uma sobrecarga na equipe. Quando estamos falando de aplicações fornecidas para clientes externos à empresa, pode ser um ponto de frustração e insatisfação com o produto.
