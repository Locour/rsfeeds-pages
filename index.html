                    <span>Build automation tools, or build tools, are applications used for build automation. Build automation is an important aspect of software development. It refers to the process of automating the tasks necessary to turn source code into executable programs. Your choice of build tool would depend on the languages and frameworks you‚Äôre using. 
Today, we‚Äôll focus on Java build tools. Java is one of the most commonly used languages in software development. There are many Java build tools available. We‚Äôll compare two of the most popular build tools for Java development: Maven and Gradle. 
We‚Äôll cover:
What is build automation?
What do build tools do?
What is Maven?
What is Gradle?
Maven vs Gradle: Similarities
Maven vs Gradle: Differences
Maven vs Gradle: Which Java build tool is right for you?

                    <span>Angular v13 has arrived! And with it come a lot of exciting new features and updates. Angular continues to improve runtime performance, decrease compilation time, promote good software development practices, enhance developer experience, and keep up to date with dependencies such as TypeScript and RxJS. Is anyone else excited about RxJS v7?! ü§© Let&#x27;s take a look at a few of the many new exciting features in Angular v13 with some code examples using authentication. 
With v13, View Engine is no longer available, replaced by Ivy. Ivy is the future of Angular applications, and the benefits are tremendous. After initially landing in v12, Ivy paves the way for new feature updates, simplifies existing capabilities, and increases rendering performance.

                    <span>ReactJS:
React (ReactJS, React.js) is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces that are open-source. Facebook created, developed, and supports this useful tool, which can be downloaded from their Github page. Facebook updates and creates new guides for this collection on a regular basis.
Advantages of ReactJS:
ReactJs has a lot of experience with SEO. While other Javascript does not allow SEO, you can easily run your ReactJS with the servers.
Disadvantages of ReactJS:
React technologies are evolving and developing at such a rapid pace that there is no time to properly document them. To get around this, developers write their own instructions when new versions and tools in their present projects evolve.
AngularJS:
AngularJS is a framework for building dynamic web applications. It allows you to utilize HTML as your template language and enhance HTML&#x27;s syntax to represent the components of your application clearly and succinctly. Data binding and dependency injection in AngularJS eliminate a lot of the code you&#x27;d have to write otherwise. And because it all happens in the browser, it&#x27;s a great companion for any server technology.
Advantages of AngularJS:
Because Angularjs is an open-source JavaScript MVC framework, anyone can create a custom application at a low cost.
Disadvantages of AngualrJS:
In Angular, there is no server authorization or authentication. Authorization is the process of granting data access authorization and identifying a user by validating credentials. Because AngularJs is unable to fulfill both functionalities, we refer to it as &quot;less secure.&quot;
AngularJs is totally dependent on JavaScript. If these scripts are hidden, the resulting pages appear to be rudimentary.
It&#x27;s huge and complicated. There are numerous ways to execute the same operation in angular, making it impossible to determine which method is the most efficient.
AngularJs is not supported by Internet Explorer 8.0.</span>

This article contains a list of tips and best practices for using the @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects libraries. The list is based on the usual NgRx mistakes I&#x27;ve seen many times (some of which I&#x27;ve made myself) and on the great talks and articles that you can find in the resources section.
Store Tips


Put global state in a single place
Don&#x27;t put the local state in the global store
Use selectors for the derived state
Use view model selectors
Treat actions as unique events
Group actions by source
Don&#x27;t dispatch actions conditionally
Create reusable reducers
Be careful with facades
Effects Tips


Name effects like functions
Keep effects simple
Don&#x27;t create &quot;boiler&quot; effects
Apply single responsibility principle
Apply good action hygiene

                    <span>When we use ngDoCheck to detect changes, we need to make sure that our implementation is extremely lightweight and fast, so it doesn‚Äôt affect user-experience. In this tutorial, we will learn how to efficiently track and process those changes using KeyValueDiffer.
ngDoCheck life-cycle hook


The official definition of this life-cycle hook goes like this:
&quot;Detect and act upon changes that Angular can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t detect on its own. Called immediately after ngOnChanges() on every change detection run, and immediately after ngOnInit() on the first run.&quot;
Simply put, Angular tracks binding inputs by object reference. It means that if an object reference hasn‚Äôt changed, the binding change is not detected and change detection is not executed. This is where we need ngDoCheck.

                    <span>To be able to load external libraries it is good to have a service which is responsible to load those scripts!
It will be looks like this
@Injectable({providedIn: &#x27;root&#x27;})
export class ExternalLibrariesService {
  static injectLib(src: string): void {
    const script &#x3D; document.createElement(&#x27;script&#x27;);
    script.src &#x3D; src;
    document.body.appendChild(script);
  }
}

With that service we can easily add external libraries as much as we want!

@Component({
  selector: &#x27;app-root&#x27;,
  template: &#x60;&#x60;,
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {

What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open source automation server for DevOps. Jenkins has ~1800 plugins that support many of the tools used in build and deployment scenarios. The plugins cover build management, source code management, administration, platforms and UI. Jenkins was designed specifically for CI/CD (continuous integration / continuous delivery) environments as well as automating other routine development tasks.
Jenkins still requires scripts to be written for the steps, but gives a framework for integrating the entire chain of build / test / deploy. These &quot;pipeline script‚Ä¶</span>

OAuth 2 Core does not say what an access token (AT) should look like, only what it should be used for. Left to their own devices, the most important OAuth-based services and products chose to encode access tokens as JWTs. Without guidance from standards, however, they ended up producing as many incompatible variants.

This article is the story of how this issue bugged me so much that I took it on myself to work with the IETF standards community to try fixing it, culminating in the publication of a new standard document describing how to encode and validate an OAuth 2.0 AT in JWT format.

I am taking this opportunity to give you a glimpse of how the standardization process works, but most importantly: I hope ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Today I faced a problem while triggering the delivery pipeline and this article is about the solution to that problem. 
Have you ever faced the need to push a commit to a Git branch without changing any files in order to re-run your integration process? If yes then you are landed at the right place, my friend. üòâ
git commit --allow-empty -m ‚ÄúMessage‚Äù

For continuous integration, we are using  Buddy delivery pipelines which allow us to build, test and deploy applications on a single push to a specific git branch. It helps us to reduce the manual overhead of deploying code to the server and handle all the actions automatically.
But today I faced a problem where I needed to re-run my delivery pipeline of a branch without adding any extra space or changing any files in the repository, so I searched for the solution for a while and It turns out that Git is allowing us to push an empty commit without adding any staged files to the branch, by using one option  --allow-empty  during git commit.
Pushing a commit with staged files
git add .

git commit -m &quot;changes on app controller&quot;

git push origin master 

The above commands will add all unstaged files and add commit and push the code to the master branch, after that our delivery pipeline will be started.
Once the pipeline process fails or you need to run the process again, you will have to push something to the branch but as I mentioned earlier, we will not make any changes to the files, and even then, We will be able to commit the branch with this command.
Pushing empty commit
git commit --allow-empty -m &quot;rerunning the delivery pipeline&quot;

git push origin master 

After the above commands, you can see that the commit has been pushed to your branch and the delivery pipeline will be started.
You learned that you can be able to push an empty commit with the --allow-empty option of git commit. let me know in the comments if there is any other way to do this.</span>

                    <span>A pod is a minimum and basic unit that is handled by Kubernetes. The pod consists of one or more containers that are connected to each other and share storage yet run independently. An application-specific pod model contains one or more containers that go on the same machine. 

Kubernetes manages things like automatically restarting a pod when it fails. However, it sometimes happens that the pod does not start when you create it for the first time or update it with new configurations. This can happen for a variety of reasons. So,today, I&#x27;ll briefly look at why this happens!
A pod may not start or fail due to various reasons, some of which are:
Pod Status is Pending
kubect to describe the pod, you can see the current pod event and determine why it does not have a schedule.

Better yet, can they fully understand if the team is going in the proper direction because they&#x27;re going off of their technical abilities from 10 years ago?

Many experts and leaders are still not convinced that Serverless will lead to the Future of Work and Emerging Technology. People don‚Äôt make the connection. What part does it play in the Future of Work and the 4th Industrial Revolution? We will explore this to help you learn in our blog content and case studies.

Kept getting an error when it tried to find a docker release for &#x27;buster&#x27; and that&#x27;s the latest version supported by this little &#x27;all in one&#x27; device
Here&#x27;s what I ran to get it working
This part is the same:
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release

Add their GPG Key (same from site):
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

[Different] Remove previous entry (this was added when the first install failed, you may have done the same)
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list

[Different] Work around to install the correct docker image:

They also serve the same function, which is to serve as a proxy between clients and applications on one side, and to a postgres instance on the other side. In that position, the first obvious advantage is that it can perform as an edge service, concentrating connections from one network, and proxy the requests to the database in a non-exposed network.
Another advantage is that the client/application side connections are decoupled from the database side connections, and therefore can serve badly behaving applications (which create and destroy connections to a d‚Ä¶</span>

Run Makefiles.
Automatically provide shims (i.e.: forwarder scripts) for the binaries.
Extend $PATH to expose the binaries, and more.

In general, Zinit has many hooks which allow surprising things. In Top 100 taking few positions being one of the best, see Zsh-100-Commits-Club

Nest gives us all the tools to work with any SQL and NoSQL database. You have a lot of options, you can also use almost all ORM and libraries in nodejs and typescript, like Sequelize, TypeORM, Prisma, and of course mongoose.
In this application, we will work with MySQL and MongoDB. We will also use the most popular js libraries; Sequelize as ORM for MySQL, and mongoose for MongoDB.
To start using sequelize; we first need to install the required dependencies which include @nestjs/sequelize, mysql2 because we will connect to MySQL database and other needed dependencies.
$ npm install --save @nestjs/sequelize sequelize sequelize-typescript mysql2
$ npm install --save-dev @types/sequelize

In Saas applications; multitenancy is a mode of operation where multiple independent instances share the same environment. In plain English, it is when multiple tenants and businesses use the same Saas application.
I will not cover how to design a multitenancy application in this article, however, you can read about it in detail here: What is Multi-Tenant Architecture? By
From here on, we are going to work on an example about the multi-tenants using multiple Databases and microservices architecture.
We will focus on ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL with multi-database and will use two databases -MySQL and MongoDB- for each tenant:

CRUD stands for Create(Insert data to database), Read (Retrieve data from database), Update (Edit data from database), and Delete (delete data from database) 
It is a popular design through which Web APIs interact with databases.
Set up an express server
Set up routes with express
Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose

                    <span>I had the opportunity to create a simple backend program with CRUD operations using ExpressJS though I&#x27;ve been using NestJS. I personally enjoyed using NestJS a lot more than ExpressJS because 1) ExpressJS doesn&#x27;t provide a structure for your project and 2) NestJS requires less set up.
1) Structure
I guess that freedom is good for others but bad for people with little experience. Let&#x27;s get into the details of how it is different. Let&#x27;s say that there are two different modules: User and Game. Nest structures this by putting all the User related files into a folder called User. That module would have a controller, service, repository, entity, and other testing files. ExpressJS, based on my personal experience, structures their projects according to its function. For example, all the controllers are grouped together and other routers are grouped together, etc.
Nest Controller &#x3D;&#x3D; Express Router
1) Set up
Although learning dependency injection, inversion of control, and other weird crazy words is difficult in the beginning NestJS really helps users focus on the project at hand instead of the set up which is really convenient for me personally.</span>

NestJS is a Node.js framework to build efficient and scalable server-side applications. Nest uses and abstracts ExpressJS under the hood to ease development but keeps its API accessible to developers.
In this tutorial, we will create a minimalist NestJS application and showcase how to deploy the application with continuous deployment on Koyeb.
Thanks to Koyeb, you will benefit from native global load-balancing across our edge network, autoscaling, automatic HTTPS (SSL), and auto-healing with zero configuration.
To successfully follow and complete this guide, you need:

In each case, the main question we want to answer is &quot;What could an adversary do if they got access to our database?&quot;
// Using Sequelize for the examples
async function saveUser(email, password) {
  await DbUser.create({

OAuth 2 Core does not say what an access token (AT) should look like, only what it should be used for. Left to their own devices, the most important OAuth-based services and products chose to encode access tokens as JWTs. Without guidance from standards, however, they ended up producing as many incompatible variants.

This article is the story of how this issue bugged me so much that I took it on myself to work with the IETF standards community to try fixing it, culminating in the publication of a new standard document describing how to encode and validate an OAuth 2.0 AT in JWT format.

                    <span>Introduction


WebAssembly is the new craze when it comes to frontend &amp; backend capabilities. The part that has me excited about it is the concept that you can use the same library for both frontend &amp; backend. (provided the backend is in Rust or NodeJs.)

Expected Prerequisites:
Rust
NodeJs
Yarn
First, we need to establish the goal of this little tutorial. This tutorial is to give a little demonstration of how to simply get Webpack to compile our Rust code into WebAssembly and import it on the frontend. To get started, lets create a new folder and enter it:
mkdir -p ./wasm-demo
cd ./wasm-demo

Now with this empty folder, lets start by adding the necessary files to get up and running.

                    <span>In part 1, we setup nestjs framework, configured and tested the microservice application using nest.js.
Nest gives us all the tools to work with any SQL and NoSQL database. You have a lot of options, you can also use almost all ORM and libraries in nodejs and typescript, like Sequelize, TypeORM, Prisma, and of course mongoose.
In this application, we will work with MySQL and MongoDB. We will also use the most popular js libraries; Sequelize as ORM for MySQL, and mongoose for MongoDB.
To start using sequelize; we first need to install the required dependencies which include @nestjs/sequelize, mysql2 because we will connect to MySQL database and other needed dependencies.
$ npm install --save @nestjs/sequelize sequelize sequelize-typescript mysql2
$ npm install --save-dev @types/sequelize

In Saas applications; multitenancy is a mode of operation where multiple independent instances share the same environment. In plain English, it is when multiple tenants and businesses use the same Saas application.
I will not cover how to design a multitenancy application in this article, however, you can read about it in detail here: What is Multi-Tenant Architecture? By
From here on, we are going to work on an example about the multi-tenants using multiple Databases and microservices architecture.
We will focus on ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL with multi-database and will use two databases -MySQL and MongoDB- for each tenant:

This is a common case - especially in schools that are introducing physical computing to CS students. They often don&#x27;t have the money, expertise, or firewall access to spin up cloud services to ingest data, and visualization services to show it. What they do often have is Excel - either running on PCs, Macs, Chromebooks or iPads, and usually want to connect a simple device to something, and plot data from it so students can work on projects.

You can consider a &#x27;classic&#x27; way of passing data, is passing data through a JSON list or Database.
This often causes having to re-deconstruct the State in each new child component. 
To avoid this you can use the useContext hook in React, and pass it&#x27;s props through a ContextProvider very easily.
This article will show you how to pass data from one central useContext that provides it&#x27;s props to all components.

ngDoCheck life-cycle hook


The official definition of this life-cycle hook goes like this:
&quot;Detect and act upon changes that Angular can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t detect on its own. Called immediately after ngOnChanges() on every change detection run, and immediately after ngOnInit() on the first run.&quot;
Simply put, Angular tracks binding inputs by object reference. It means that if an object reference hasn‚Äôt changed, the binding change is not detected and change detection is not executed. This is where we need ngDoCheck.

                    <span>To be able to load external libraries it is good to have a service which is responsible to load those scripts!
It will be looks like this
@Injectable({providedIn: &#x27;root&#x27;})
export class ExternalLibrariesService {
  static injectLib(src: string): void {
    const script &#x3D; document.createElement(&#x27;script&#x27;);
    script.src &#x3D; src;
    document.body.appendChild(script);
  }
}

With that service we can easily add external libraries as much as we want!

In a lot of cases not cancelling stale asynchronous tasks has few consequences, but in that case of network requests this can lead to unexpected behaviour such as race conditions.
This issue can be further complicated when network requests are spawned from a state management system where the result of the request is assigned to state. If uncancelled requests are allowed to complete, they may finish in an order you may not anticipate and thus corrupt your application state.

Sometimes when I&#x27;m learning a new paradigm, it&#x27;s the seemingly simplest things that can trip me up. I often overlook certain concepts because they seem tricky at first.
TypeScript Generics is one of those concepts.
Let&#x27;s take the example below:
interface Lengthwise {
  length: number;
}

function loggingIdentity(arg: T): T {
  console.log(arg.length);
  return arg;
}

console.log(loggingIdentity([&#x27;hello world&#x27;]))

If you&#x27;re like me you might be asking:
What exactly is T here?
Why is T used, is that arbitrary?
Why can&#x27;t I just write loggingIdentity(arg: Lengthwise)?
What does  mean?

In this post we will look at how to set up and perform CRUD operations in AG Grid while keeping our row data inside the Redux store. Redux enables unidirectional dataflow, providing more control over application state and tools to address issues associated with data mutability.
We&#x27;ve built a sample to illustrate this - please see it in action below:

Live Demo


The live demo below shows how to update row data in the Redux store by performing actions in AG Grid. Right-click a row to display the context menu and see the available actions you can perform to the Redux store.

                    <span>The Lacework VS Code vulnerability scanner extension is a new plugin that will quickly identify vulnerabilities in your base images right from your IDE. This is a first step and alpha release with expanded and additional capabilities to be released soon.
This blog covers how to install lw-scanner and leverage it to perform image assurance scans from within VS Code.
Install lw-scanner
support.lacework.com and the the latest release of the scanner binary can be found at github.com
Once lw-scanner is installed the next step is to download the Lacework plugin from the VS Code Marketplace.

With an active Dockerfile in the editor you can initiate an image assurance scan by clicking Command+Shift+P on macOS (Control+Shift+P on Windows/Linux).

Once the scan is complete you will see a summary next to the base image that will disappear along with a more detailed scan result available in the output window.

Source code can be found here for now: github.
This is just a quick preview update. For suggestions or feedback please open an issue on the repo. PRs welcomed. Stay tuned for more.
Cheers,

                    <span>Why rate limit?


Rate limiting is a simple way of stopping users (hopefully just the bad ones!) from accessing more of your sites resources than you would like.
I will show you a simple way to rate limit specific URLs by using Nginx.
The written instructions are below, but here is a quick video walkthrough showing how to apply rate limiting in Nginx.





  
  
  How to add rate limiting in nginx


At the top of you nginx file, you can define a map like so:
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr_map zone&#x3D;mylimit:10m rate&#x3D;5r/s;
limit_req_status 429;

map $request_uri $binary_remote_addr_map {
    default &quot;&quot;;
    ~^/what-is-new.html $binary_remote_addr;
    ~^/another-url-to-rate-limit.html $binary_remote_addr;
}

Then within your location block, add:
limit_req zone&#x3D;mylimit;

And that&#x27;s it! Now only webpages matching the $request_uri will have rate limiting applied. This is handy when you have all of your request being routed through a single place, but you only want to have specific pages on your site rate limited.</span>

                    <span>According to a recent research by Cambridge University&#x27;s Nicholas Boucher and Ross Anderson, there are two vulnerabilities that impact most code compilers.
These sorts of vulnerabilities have an impact on software supply chains; for example, if an attacker successfully commits code injection by deceiving human reviewers, future software is likely to inherit the vulnerability.
But let&#x27;s look at the technique:
Extended strings: make sections of string literals seem as code, having the same impact as comments and causing string comparison to fail.


Comment out: forces a comment to appear as code, which is then ignored.


Early returns: bypass a function by running a return statement that seems to be inside a comment.

If you don&#x27;t care about the context of these tests and want to go straight to the node-fetch mocks, skip to the here&#x27;s my solution section.
I wrote a middleware library to be used by micro-services that decodes and verifies JWTs and works with Express and Koa. The requirement was for the library to make an API request to an external service in order to refresh tokens if the provided token had expired. I&#x27;m not writing this post to discuss the library itself, but to talk about how I wrote the unit tests for it as I found it a little tricky to implement a solution that catered for sending and receiving dynamic data to and from the external service, whilst keeping the tests isolated. Hopefully this will be helpful to someone trying to do a similar thing.

Everything about this article was well done and very interesting.
There was one point in the article that spiked my interest: the author triggered the &quot;creation&quot; of the Form Controls dynamically within the Angular HTML.
So, I decided to experiment and see if I could use this as a means to trigger data validation and transformation.
This is an experiment, simple to see if I can do something. Personally, I see some benefit in the pattern. But, this does not mean I am endorsing this as a good pattern or a better means than any other way of doing something.

                    <span>Hey everyone! I am back with another Linux article!üòä
Today I will be going over basic commands you can use to monitor system performance! üìàüìâüíª
The &#x27;top&#x27; command is used to display active processes and how much they are using system resources.

lsof stands for list of open files- basically shows you list of files and the processes

&#x27;tcpdump&#x27; is used to analyze network traffic
&#x27;htop&#x27; is a lot like top - It&#x27;s just allows you to monitor system resources or processes. As you can see, it&#x27;s a bit more fancy than top

&#x27;iostat&#x27; is a command that is used to monitor input/output devices, by telling you how long the devices have been active.

Displays the processes

Tells you how long the system has been up

&#x27;free&#x27; shows you the amount of available memory you have.

Used to monitor individual tasks. Great for troubleshooting issues.

&#x27;w&#x27; tells you information about users logged on and their processes

These commands can be vital for you to monitor your system, so I will be releasing a part 2 soon, as well!üòÜ
For future Linux and security content, please give me a follow

                    <span>A well-known way is to use getaddrinfo() such like:

#include 

int main(void)
{
    struct addrinfo hints;
    memset(&amp;hints, 0, sizeof(struct addrinfo));
    hints.ai_family &#x3D; AF_INET6;
    hints.ai_socktype &#x3D; SOCK_DGRAM;
    hints.ai_protocol &#x3D; IPPROTO_UDP;

    struct addrinfo* result_addrinfo &#x3D; nullptr;

                    <span>Have you ever encountered ERROR: One or more PGP signatures could not be verified! this error during the installation of Dropbox in Arch based distro ? If yes then this guide is for you. 
Dropbox has their own PGP key because they upload it directly to the AUR that key is for linux@dropbox.com (if you don&#x27;t know what PGP keys are it&#x27;s basically a complex math formula that proves that this app is being uploaded and managed on the AUR by somebody at dropbox)
if you use a tool like yay or paru it can handle the functions of pacman and downloading stuff from the AUR and it&#x27;s dead simple to use, I recommend paru because it&#x27;s more modern and faster
To install paru run these commands
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git

cd paru

makepkg -si

After succesfully installing paru now it&#x27;s time to install Dropbox. To do that first run
paru dropbox

Now you&#x27;ll be prompt with a list of packages from AUR to choose from. You have to choose aur/dropbox which should be the first one... So press 1 and hit enter

If you want to review hit Y and enter

To close the review hit q on the the keyboard
Now you must prompt with installation confirmation. Hit Y and enter. You may need to enter your password for installation. 
After completion of you installation run dropbox on your terminal or search on the GUI

That&#x27;s it!</span>
