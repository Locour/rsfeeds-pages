In the next few passages, I will try to explain why in many Angular projects it is important to have good modal and notification features as well as why I wrote the npm library on that subject.
In the professional world, I have several years as an Angular developer behind me and a few more of developing in other technologies.
Angular is for sure one of the worthy things that improved web development in the last ten years. The way it hand…</span>

We are going to use a pattern that is used by  Angular Material. My intention with this post is to show you how these libraries do it. We just use what the library gives us, and most of the time we use it without actually knowing how it works.

Creating frontend is not as easy as it is learning html/css/js. The real hard work starts when you start using frameworks and libraries to make your frontend look more exciting.

Creating frontend is not as easy as it is learning html/css/js. The real hard work starts when you start using frameworks and libraries to make your frontend look more exciting.

Checking the filename is especially important when it displayed on a web page to prevent HTML or XSS injection. That’s just on the frontend. On the backend, there are the other usual injections to …</span>

It is “true edge” because Functions work on 200+ edge locations (link to doc) while its predecessor, the Lambda@Edge, runs on a small number of regional edge caches.
One of the use cases for Lambda@Edge was adding security HTTP headers (it’s even listed on the product page), and now there is one more way to make it using CloudFront Functions. 
Security Headers are one of the web security pillars.

We are going to use a pattern that is used by  Angular Material. My intention with this post is to show you how these libraries do it. We just use what the library gives us, and most of the time we use it without actually knowing how it works.

Almost every new application starts out its life under very simple circumstances.

However, the number of users starts to grow, traffic spikes, transactions increase across the system, and user needs might prompt the requirement of mobile, d…</span>

I&#x27;m not a 100% familiar with NodeJS workers and clusters. I know that we can make use of multiple threads which is amazing to say the least.
I&#x27;m working on a small personal project that I&#x27;ve hosted on an free EC2 instance and I see that there is one CPU and one thread available. Is there then any benefit of using worker threads?
Also, why does the NodeJS Cluster documentation fork a cluster for a single CPU instead of a thread?

⦁ A primary key in another (foreign) table.

                    <span>With the advent of Agile and DevOps and the advancement in technology, the software industry is undergoing a rapid change. Testing, as a component of the software industry, is also going to new heights. We&#x27;ve come a long way from manual testing to record-and-playback tools to automation testing and now to codeless test automation. Change is the only constant, and there will be further advancements to make this journey more enjoyable and productive.

                    <span>While many Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu) include graphical interfaces, it can be useful—and fun—to learn how to navigate the command line.
One of the questions I get from students most often is: what are some good commands to learn on Linux? 
It took me a long time to learn Linux commands (along with tmux, ssh, vim, pgp and many other programs). Now I would recommend learning the command line by exercise because that saves a lot of your time.

This week, we go through the plugin implementation for Linux. Similar to Windows, we combine Dart and C++ code for Linux. The unexpected thing is the C++ data types of Flutter defined for Linux change a lot. So it still takes a little bit of time to make the plugin work.

I love a bit of architecture. How you structure your application is so important and if you get it wrong you&#x27;ll really pay for it down the line. The problem is you often don&#x27;t know you&#x27;ve got it wrong until it&#x27;s too late. I&#x27;ve made this mistake so many times and iterated on solutions so much that now when I start a project I know exactly how I want it to be structured. I&#x27;ve developed what I consider to be a pretty robust pattern for application development.

And as soon as the data is valid, we know that it is safe, because we define a set of rules to be followed, in order to have a standardization. This standardization can be from the type of data, up to the number of characters.
Data validation can be done on the client side and on the server side. From what I usually see on the internet, most people implement form validation just on the client side. But in this article I will talk about a library t…</span>

This post assumes you are following along with the baseline project tutorial, but the concepts apply to any Typescript project.
We are going to use a logging library called pino for our application. Using a mature logging library is recommended because it allows us to access structured log data as JSON objects. Later, we can configure it to persist log data by outputting logs to a file or an external server.

                    <span>There is more to developing a component than making sure the component looks and works the way it should. Components are a huge portion of what our SPA is made up of so we should consider each component&#x27;s performance, usability, readability, and more. This will help make sure our code stays maintainable and performant over time.
For the user&#x27;s sake, we want the component to be as performant as it can be. The SPA&#x27;s job is to quickly render the data provided by the backend systems. Achieving this can be suppl…</span>

Before that, I used some regular editors like nano and mc.  When I found that many people were using vim, I decided to give it a try.
I can instantly switch between all my operating systems (OSX, Linux and Windows) without having to change anything. Even when logging in over an SSH connection to remote computers.
