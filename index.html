However, as great as using Firebase Functions are, sometimes we just want a simple and quick way to be able to search through our data. Unfortunately, the Firebase Team has not built this natively yet.
So, I wanted to create a quick way to index your data from the frontend...
Note: - This post uses angular examples, but the premise is for any framework.
The core of this code is based on the soundex function which has been used in SQL databases for generations to emulate a fuzzy search. It basically translates your text so that similar sounds in the English Language would be stored as the same string. There are other versions in other languag…</span>

We will start by creating a new angular application using ng new my-app command present in cli.
In this application we will have a toast module which will show toast on click of a button.
We will load toast module inside multiple modules and check how its shipped to the user.
It doesn&#x27;t included basic Angular commands like creating component, module.
Let&#x27;s start then.
As a first use case we will include the toast module in the main app module.
The toast module has a component and a service which is used to create the message and can be called by outside module where its injected, in our use case its app module.

You can capture errors as they happen, with zero involvement from application users. Then of course you can work to fix the error, contact end users or whatever might seem appropriate on each case.
As part of this article we examine how we can setup proactive monitoring using Angular 12 and Datadog, by following two different approaches. The implementation should be similar for React and Vue and of course this can be adjusted to use Sentry or any other Datadog alternative.
Datadog is mostly popular as a cloud and infrastructure monitoring but it can be also used as a centralized logging platform. Personally I find that you get better application insights when you combine infrastru…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
highcharts is a rich and interactive charts library based on SVG.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the application with the Angular base structure using the @angular/cli with the route file and the SCSS style format.
ng new angular-highcharts
? Would you like to add Angular routing? Yes
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? SCSS   [ https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss                ]

                    <span>I&#x27;m not gonna talk about how does a DHCP server work exactly, 
If one of the devices in the network is configured with a static IP address, when the DHCP server starts distributing the IP addresses to other machines, what happens exactly ? does it skip it ? or does it duplicate it and therefore there would be a conflict ? 
So the answer is, NOPE the DHCP server will not distribute that IP address, you may be wondering, but how ?
Remember that the DHCP server sends an ARP Broadcast asking about the IP address about to be distributed 
&quot;Who has x.x.x.x&quot;
At that moment the machine with that static IP address will respond with an ARP saying that it got that IP and that its MAC address is X:X:X:X:X:X so the DHCP server will continue to the next IP address asking &quot;Who has y.y.y.y&quot;
But here comes another problem, 
what if the local network is placed behind a router, and we all know that the routers doesn&#x27;t allow broadcasting, then what happens ?
well simply instead of ARP Broadcasting, it uses ICMP Packet type 8 code 0 which is the ECHO request ( ping ) and if it gets no answer than it distributes it, else it simply continues to the next IP address.
And here comes the last question, 
And what if a device that is configured with a static IP address was shutdown, and the DHCP distributed its IP address, what happens if the machine is up again?
well there are two solutions for this, some DHCP servers are advanced enough and caches the static IP address and therefore this conflict will never occurs, but if the DHCP server doesn&#x27;t provide this feature, than it should be configured to exclude these IP addresses or else there will be an IP Duplication.
And this pretty much sums up the main problems of dealing with a DHCP server.</span>

We&#x27;re using it for business meetings, side projects and anything else where we need some flexible coordination. However, most tools are very limited in terms of control, customization, data protection, and most important - they are not free! That&#x27;s where Calendso &amp; Synpse come in. Self-hosted, all your data sitting on your own machines. API-driven and ready to be deployed on your own domain. Full control of your events and data.
In this tutorial we will be deploying a self-hosted Calendso instance that lives under your own DNS domain. You will be able to share meeting links such as https://calendar.synpse.net/karolis/quick-chat with your colleagues, clients and friends:

                    <span>Continuous Integration is a great software development practice, we can reduce integration problems and we can allow teams to develop cohesive software more rapidly.
There are many interesting CI tools in the market but I think the dev CI experience can still be improved. I see companies and dev teams struggling and disappointed when they have to run and setup CI pipelines.
Most of the IT companies care about code privacy and they don’t like the idea to run their code on external public CI platforms. It&#x27;s possible to have CI solutions on-premise but most of the time this kind of solutions are expensive for the company. For example, Atlassian has stopped selling new on-prem server licenses. ref.







  
  
  Build queue and CI debug:



As a developer and member of a tech team I’d like to see our CI builds running immediately after a code change and I’d like to see an easy way for debugging the code when it’s running on CI. Most of the time I see teams and developers complaining about long builds queues and usually it’s even quite difficult debugging the code if an error happens during the CI process.
How many times we see commits failing on CI because the code has not been tested enough locally or the code has not been rebased with the main branch yet. Every time we run a build on Cloud it’s a cost for the team and the company. The good news is we can now easily avoid this scenario. Few years ago, Git has introduced &quot;Git hooks&quot;, this new technology allows developers to execute pre-tests before a commit will trigger a new CI process in Cloud.
After a long brainstorming with some friends, we created a small CI tool localci.io to address all these issues. This tool doesn’t fit with any IT infrastructure, but this could be useful at least for some team. Probably, in the future it will be completely free but currently we still need to cover some cloud costs.</span>

And when we open the config file we will see these details.

Kubectl need to connect to the k8s master, we nees:
DNS/IP of the cluster
Authentication Credentials
which will found in kubeconfig.
I&#x27;m setting up in windows. So, will be using below reference.
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/
Download this Kubectl binary

Next Step, Move that Binary to C:\Binaries. If Binaries folder is not there, create one.

Create a Environment Variable to call this Binary.

Move the kubeconfig file to C:\Users\ .kube and name it as config ( removing .yml extension)

To Verify, run kubectl , it will work from any path.

For, linux and MacOS installation refer below link.

In this article, we will discuss how DBA can run a MongoDB instance using docker-compose. It’s very easy and quite flexible to handle. According to my opinion docker-compose removes all the installation and configuration pain when you need a test instance immediately. In a non-production environment for proof of concepts (POC) environment, you can easily use MongoDB on docker-compose.
High-Level Steps for Installation &amp; Configuration

GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time. As Carpenter notes, because it allows for real-time collaboration, GitHub encourages teams to work together to build and edit their site content.

I am going to be honest, I have been focusing on completing my law degree.  The last 2 years of this degree has been &#x27;brutal&#x27;. As such, I have not had the time to focus on the fun stuff like coding.  So, Hacktoberfest is a big deal for me.  It not only gives the opportunity to &#x27;stay in the game of coding&#x27; but it also gives me that little breather from studies.
I have participated in 2 Hacktoberfest.  Last year, I ran an event to inspire other people to get involved with Hacktoberfest.  Over 250 people showed up for an online tutorial. *SHOCK 
Notably, this year has had its challenges.  I know I am not the only one.  The hard times teaches us compassion and empathy. So, for me, Hacktoberfest is about joining a fun community, celebrating a month of code, inspir…</span>

I have been an advocate for the #CloudGuruChallenge since Forrest Brazeal started it with The Cloud Resume Challenge. Before his announcement, I would often find myself thinking of side projects that I could build to enhance my skills, yet that usually didn&#x27;t turn out well. Now acloudguru provides a bunch of these awesome challenges regularly that I can really dive into. 
https://acloudguru.com/blog/tag/cloudguruchallenge
Unfortunately, when actively participating in literally every challenge that is released by acloudguru you may find some overlap. This existence of this overlap is precisely how I dreamt up this challenge. 
More specifically, I am referring to three challenges in particular.

                    <span>The Problem


If you’re like me and run a home Linux server, you may wish to add some extra security in the form of a VPN connection to ensure traffic is encrypted. In my case, I use a Raspberry Pi to backup things like RAW images from my camera to an off-site location. The extra security gives me a little peace of mind, especially as the server generally uses a cellular connection.
I’ve been using UFW to work as a killswitch and only allow traffic via the VPN connection, but one issue I&#x27;ve had is with my trusted VPN provider is that they regularly rotate IP addresses. UFW uses iptables under the hood, meaning it can only be configured to use IP addresses explicitly and not a domain name. This has left my backup machine without an internet connection fairly frequently.

                    <span>Setting Up Kubernetes using Digital Ocean K8s Managed Service



You can use my referral you will get $100 free usage for 3 months.


And when we open the config file we will see these details.

Kubectl need to connect to the k8s master, we nees:
DNS/IP of the cluster
Authentication Credentials
which will found in kubeconfig.
I&#x27;m setting up in windows. So, will be using below reference.
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/
Download this Kubectl binary

Next Step, Move that Binary to C:\Binaries. If Binaries folder is not there, create one.

Create a Environment Variable to call this Binary.

Move the kubeconfig file to C:\Users\ .kube and name it as config ( removing .yml extension)

To Verify, run kubectl , it will work from any path.

For, linux and MacOS installation refer below link.

                    <span>Buat kalian yang pengen berkarir di IT, baik di Tim Developer, Operations maupun Security, menguasai Linux bisa menjadi nilai plus buat kalian apalagi tim Operations dan Security yang sehari-hari tidak bisa lepas dari server.
Karena menurut data statistik, 1 juta website terpopuler pake Linux buat OS Server-nya.
Lalu, kita ngga bisa denial kalo OS pilihan dari kebanyakan hacker itu ya Linux..
Ini karena hacker-hacker tuh suka otak-atik semaunya sendiri dan karena Linux itu open-source, Linux bisa di-customize buat nyesuaiin kebutuhan mereka.
Dan juga, unethical dan bad hackers biasanya pake tools yang mereka bikin sendiri atau yang sudah tersedia di Linux untuk nge-hack ke dalam jaringan dan aplikasi yang lemah dan rentan keamanannya.
Banyak Distro Linux yang sudah terinstall tools buat hacking yang siap pake.
Tapi jika tools tersebut belum ada, maka tinggal diinstall dong wkwk.
Diantara Distro Linux buat hacking yang umum dipake adalah:
Kali Linux, yang berbasis dari varian Debian.
BackBox, yang berbasis dari varian Ubuntu.
Parrot Security OS, yang berbasis dari varian Debian.
CAINE, yang berarti Computer Aided INvestigative Environment yang biasanya dipake buat Digital Forensic dan
Samurai Web Testing Framework untuk pentest (penetration testing) aplikasi web (web application).
Jadi jika kalian mau berkarir di Tim Operations (seperti DevOps dan SRE) maupun belajar hacking sebagai hobi, atau untuk menjadi ethical hacker, kalian wajib belajar dan jago di Linux xD.</span>

                    <span>Linux Command Line atau Shell adalah process dari OS yang memungkinkan kita untuk mengatur komputer dengan menggunakan perintah-perintah sebagai text interface.
Pada Desktop Environment modern, tidak terlalu penting juga menggunakan Shell.
Tapi kebanyakan tool-tool buat hacking itu berbasis CLI dan jika kita mau belajar hacking, hukumnya fardhu &#x27;ain (sangat wajib) buat terbiasa di &quot;dunia hitam&quot; eh Shell terminal maksudnya dan juga wajib tahu di luar-kepala tentang perintah dasar dan perintah advance dari Linux.
Coba ketik perintah date
$ date
Sat  2 Oct 15:41:49 UTC 2021

Maka akan muncul jam dan tanggal seperti contoh di atas.
Pada series Belajar Linux Commands kita akan belajar tentang macam-macam perintah Linux yang wajib kita tahu jika kita ingin menjadi hacker xD.
Seperti Desktop Environment dan Aplikasinya, Linux OS juga bisa diotak-atik sesuai selera kita masing-masing.

Kita ga perlu bingung, karena banyak Desktop Environment yang bisa kita pilih sesuai selera kita.
Beberapa yang umum digunakan adalah GNOME, KDE, LKDE dan MATE Desktop.
Pada environment server, biasanya kita ngga akan menjumpai Desktop Environment disana, tapi jika kita maksa buat nge-install, kita akan akan disuguhi tampilan desktop lengkap dengan icon-icon dan aplikasi-aplikasi yang bisa kita klik dan start.

Akan tetapi, sekarang kebanyakan Linux OS datang dengan graphical server yang dikenal dengan X server atau X.
X server memungkinkan untuk menampikan tampilan grafis ke layar monitor kita.
Pada environment server, biasanya tidak terinstall X server, tapi jika kita memaksa menginstall X server, kita akan disuguhi oleh login screen dan full GUI (seperti windows dan MacOS) yang bisa di-klik.

Contohnya, ketika kita login atau ketika kita mengetikkan perintah print, login atau printing service itu jalan sebagai sebuah daemon.
Di Linux, kita bisa liat daftar process-process yang sedang berjalan dengan mengetikkan perintah ps -ef. Tiap process punya identitas uniknya masing-masing yang disebut PID yang berarti Process IDentifier.
Salah satu process yang krusial di Linux adalah init process, yang bisa dibilang sebagai kakek dari semua process-process, kenapa kok dibilang kakek? Karena setiap process yang jalan, kecuali kernel, adalah (child) turunan dari init process ini dan bisa dilacak ulang sampai init. Kernelnya sendiri jalan di…</span>

Kita mungkin sering melihat pesan sekilas pada monitor kita seperti &quot;Your computer is starting up&quot;.
Ketika pesan sekilas ini muncul, bagian bootloader dari OS sedang bekerja di belakang layar (background), memastikan komputer kita siap dipake.
Bootloader adalah bagian dari Master Boot Record (MBR) yang mana MBR adalah bagian dari OS.
Bootloader itu kerjanya ngapain sih? Dia itu kerjanya nge-load OS ke RAM komputer kita.
Umumnya Bootloader Linux itu berisi:
GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader)
LILO (LInux LOader)
Syslinux yang mana campuran dari banyak bootloader-bootloader ringan yang bikin komputer kita berhasil boot dari berbagai macam metode, seperti dari CD, DVD, USB bahkan dari LAN.

uname -r dan uname -a

lsb_release -a
cat /etc/os-release

I have created a self-interview preparation CLI toolkit, which will show me random questions whenever I run a CLI command called &quot;interview&quot;.
Sounds cool right.
I felt I would require a real-time experience of attending an interview, but I wanted to have control over what I could be expecting, and still having the random unexpectedness of attending an interview.
This simple project I felt was in the right direction.
Latest version of  Node.js installed(I used v14.18.0)

Next, open your project folder and enter the below commands to create and initiate the node.js project setup.

Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications*
Express (the default) and optionally can be configured to use [Fastify*(https://github.com/fastify/fastify) as well!
So this means, that a lot of smart people put much effort in building on top of express (or fastify) a set of pre-built capabilities like logging or validation. This is great, because you dont have to built this by yourself, which means that you can focus on what matters, the business logic.

                    <span>Good day !
Coming home from the Devoxx conference in Paris, the main technology that I wanted to try out and explore was serverless.
Just to clarify what serverless is in a few words :
Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. Servers are still used, but a company that gets backend services from a serverless vendor is charged based on usage, not a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers. (Source : cloudflare)
I&#x27;ve been playing around with NestJS (a NodeJS framework) for some time now and wanted to try building a server using AWS lambda functions using NestJS for the backend of an application.
To speed up the process and have a nice base to kickstart my projects, I&#x27;ve built a simple repository (usable as a template on Github). It contains the…</span>

I forgave my colleague for saying nodejs is a Javascript library, because he is wrong and nodejs is not a Javascript library.
Nodejs is runtime environment for javascript on the server. It uses the javascript v8 engine, hence it&#x27;s a single threaded, event driven environment.

                    <span>we as developer have hundred of project in the machine, but have you&#x27;ve ever wondered how much space node_modules takes on single project and what happens when you&#x27;re running out of free space. this will help you to make some free space safely.
before removing let&#x27;s show all the node_modules directories and its memory. cause the removing process is irrevisable so we need to make sure. first cd into a specific directory where most of the projects are:
LINX/MACOS
$ cd Dev/
$ find . -name &quot;node_modules&quot; -type d -prune | xargs du -chs


WINDOW
$ cd Dev 
$ FOR /d /r . %d in (node_modules) DO @IF EXIST &quot;%d&quot; echo %d&quot;

now let&#x27;s remove all the node_modules directories from all the projects. make sure that you&#x27;re inside a directory where you&#x27;re comfortable removing all the node_modules cause this action is irereversable:
LINUX
$ cd Dev
$ find . -name &quot;node_modules&quot; -type d -prune -exec rm -rf &#x27;{}&#x27; +

WINDOW
$ cd Dev 
$ FOR /d /r . %d in (node_modules) DO @IF EXIST &quot;%d&quot; rm -rf &quot;%d&quot;

a single node_modules took about 400MB - 90MB in my cases and total space it took around 10gigabyte - 15gigabyte. it will help you to free up some space in your machine if you have limited SSD, but if you&#x27;ve removed from all the directories, you have to install it again for the project you&#x27;re working on, keep this in mind.

Let&#x27;s open our terminal and hit npm install node-imap. to install IMAP package.
In this blog, we are mainly focusing on how to read email attachments based on the DATE RANGE, FROM particular email address and it&#x27;s SUBJECT.
Let&#x27;s see from the below example code which fetches first 3 email messages from the mail box.
var Imap &#x3D; require(&#x27;node-imap&#x27;),
    inspect &#x3D; require(&#x27;util&#x27;).inspect;

                    <span>❓ What is CORS?


Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a “preflight” request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.

The solution to bypass CORS is to use a Proxy. A Proxy server, that forwards your request as it is.
But, problems with a Proxy Server is to manage the server, optimize the server, handle traffic, use of Kubernetes to minimize bills, and what n…</span>

I selected two features to work on for this week. the features are as follows:

                    <span>The Problem


If you’re like me and run a home Linux server, you may wish to add some extra security in the form of a VPN connection to ensure traffic is encrypted. In my case, I use a Raspberry Pi to backup things like RAW images from my camera to an off-site location. The extra security gives me a little peace of mind, especially as the server generally uses a cellular connection.
I’ve been using UFW to work as a killswitch and only allow traffic via the VPN connection, but one issue I&#x27;ve had is with my trusted VPN provider is that they regularly rotate IP addresses. UFW uses iptables under the hood, meaning it can only be configured to use IP addresses explicitly and not a domain name. This has left my backup machine without an internet connection fairly frequently.

                    <span>Post-quantum cryptography is being developed, benchmarked, tested, discussed, and elaborated... Let me join in on that with a little practical software piece. falcon-cli is a CLI tool to sign and verify files with the post-quantum signature scheme FALCON, a round 3 finalist for digital signature algorithms in NIST&#x27;s post-quantum cryptography standardization competition.
The tool supports keygen, file sign and verify ops, as such it is complete and ready for common file signature use cases. Imagine - now you can sign your Github Releases with (probably) post-quantum safe signatures and chill (4ever)...
Usage should be straightforward when glimpsin&#x27; over the README. The default key location shouldn&#x27;t be surprisin&#x27; as well: ~/.falcon-cli/(public|secret).key. Also, if explicit input or output files are omitted, the tool falls back to stdin and stdout for IO.

Using .env files to manage application config and secrets is a step forward from hard-coding secrets, but there are also security risks and issues relating to the synchronization and manual management of .env files across different environments. This tutorial introduces Doppler, a solution to secret management and synchronization.
In this article, we have a Django application that has its secrets defined in a .env file. We will look at how we can move those secrets from the traditional .env file to Doppler.
Managing secrets and configs in Doppler keeps them in sync across different environments. You only have to define your secrets once and Doppler acts as a central source of truth for your secrets, saving you the stress of having to re-define them in every environment or share t…</span>

Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications*
Express (the default) and optionally can be configured to use [Fastify*(https://github.com/fastify/fastify) as well!
So this means, that a lot of smart people put much effort in building on top of express (or fastify) a set of pre-built capabilities like logging or validation. This is great, because you dont have to built this by yourself, which means that you can focus on what matters, the business logic.

                    <span>Ever since the introduction of hooks in React 16.8, they have become an integral part of every React devs arsenal.
Recently while I was working on one of my projects, I encountered a relatively common problem. I wanted to scroll to a component when its loaded on screen or on some other event. If you have worked with pure js, then there is a very simple solution using scrollIntoView function.
const elmnt &#x3D; document.getElementById(&quot;content&quot;);
elmnt.scrollIntoView();

Run the above code on that particular event and it works like a charm.
Now when I searched for a solution in React, I came across this library react-scroll. Its a react library for animating vertical scrolling that provides functionality to scroll to a component on an event. Its good but I didn&#x27;t want to add another dependency a…</span>

Hey, often we make console.log(...) to see the value of a parameter or a result method.
Here I present you a decorator which allow to do it easily. It’s purpose is for debugging when you are developing something.
Now that’s how to use it:
class Toto {
  @Log()
  public myMethod(...args: unknown[]): boolean { ... }

  @Log({ outputs: false })
  public myMethod2(...args: unknown[]): void { ... }

  @Log({ inputs: false })
  public myMethod3(...args: unknown[]): unknown { ... }

  @Log({ type: &#x27;trace&#x27; })
  public myMethod4(...args: unknown[]): unknown { ... }

  @Log({ type: &#x27;trace&#x27;, inputs: false, outputs: false })
  public myMethod5(...args: unknown[]): unknown { ... }

}

Hope this could help or inspire someone.

TypeScript is a superset of Javascript, invented by Microsoft, that adds strong type checking. Hence, the &#x27;type&#x27; in TypeScript, I guess.

                    <span>As your codebase grows, there is only one way to increase developer productivity: Documentation. One of many reasons I prefer TypeScript to JavaScript is that overtime, as your codebase grows, developer productivity increases because TypeScript (and typed languages in general) offer something that dynamically typed languages cannot, automatic documentation in your IDE.
This article assumes you&#x27;re familiar with React Query. If you&#x27;re not, I highly recommend you read the official docs and this intro guide by Sai Kranthi.

                    <span>Amongst the new features of TypeScript 4.5, support for loading external packages in place of built-in type definitions (standard library) is particularly of note. The original intent seems to be externalizing lib.dom.d.ts as @types/web so that users can have separate upgrading schedule for TypeScript&#x27;s core type definitions and one for DOM. The type definitions for DOM are fragile and often breaks backwards compatibility, probably because they are auto-generated.
Thanks to this nicely generalized solution for externalized standard library, better-typescript-lib, a library developed by the author, also receives huge benefit. Particularly, installation is far easier starting from better-typescript-lib v2 that supports TS 4.5 and later.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently been on a mission to eliminate all Typescript errors in our code base at work, and have been steadily chipping away at them systematically, during any downtime I get.

It was whilst doing this last week that I came across a situation that was new to me. What I was faced with was this...

                    <span>Angular is a front-end technology, so it becomes essential to find and utilize the finest resources globally when building web applications. End-user experience is definitely going to be affected directly by this!
When looking for an outsourcing Angular Full stack developer, there are few things one should always keep in mind. The Angular Developer must be capable of upscaling your product development capabilities.
To accomplish this goal, there are numerous options available to choose from, for example, Freelancing, in-house Angular Developers, hiring remote offshore developers, or outsourcing from any globally accredited Angular development company.

With TalkJS, AllParts have implemented a buyer-seller chat that the customers can use to resolve queries, get recommendations or ask general questions. It is not a full-fledged application but goes well with this tutorial. You can set up your project from GitHub before getting started and if you’ve already done that, let’s get going.

                    <span>I want to preface all of this by saying I&#x27;m a pretty new developer. If there&#x27;s any clarification needed because my question is not preicse enough I&#x27;ll gladly provide!
So as part of my current education we&#x27;re doing something they call pop-up internship where you go to visit a company for a day or two and run through a couple different departments to get a feel for how different companies might tackle some of the daily tasks they encounter.
One company in particular had an app in development that really got me interested. They were building a web application for one of their customers based on the Angular framework from what I understand. The backend/serverside code was written in Java. The interesting part is that they used some way to turn the expoted Java-WAR into a file they would include in the Angular project. This allowed them to call methods from that service and, what was the most interesting to me, the classes for the project were only defined in that Java code yet perfectly usable in that Angular code. I saw some kind of service URL in the code which I assume is somehow being used to make the actual calls in some way.
Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t able to dig deep enough/get into the deeper questions I had regarding the whole procedure. 
I don&#x27;t have any experience with Java, writing mostly little PHP and C# applications so far so I wondered - is a model like this possible to set up with Angular and PHP? If yes, where do I need to look in terms of guidance to set something like that up with my Angular project? What are some key things I need to know before tackling something like this? Is it even worth doing like that?
There&#x27;s a lot floating in my head right now regarding this because this is kinda exciting to me, any and all help would be greatly appreciated</span>

                    <span>What is &quot;infrastructure-as-code&quot;?


To keep the concept simple, think of your infrastructure as a picture (end-state) and the main characteristics (configuration) that you would use to describe it.
Using this information you should be able to reproduce the picture any time you need, and the result should always be the same as the original.
There are several tools and methods to implement this approach but the most important thing to consider is that you also need to adapt your management procedures to switch from the traditional imperative model to the infrastructure-as-code declarative model.
To successfully implement infrastructure-as-code special attention must be paid to the selection of supporting tools and the definition of the conceptual model that will represent the managed environ…</span>

Parallel Test Runs.
Browser tests and User Acceptance Tests.
Seamless integration with Heroku pipelines.
Easy customization of test dependencies in the test environment.
A Simple Integrated Solution (integration, hosting and deployment)
Simple, prescriptive developer experience in modern CI/CD solutions
Management support.

Create a cluster. For new accounts, you can use the forever free tier!
Create the super admin user.
To better visualize our data, we&#x27;ll be using the official GUI for MongoDB, Compass.
Download the latest Compass version here.
Install the thing!
Get the database connection string from Atlas.

Node.js is single threaded by default and hence only utilizes one cpu core for that thread. So, to take advantage of all the cores available we need to launch a cluster of Node.js processes.
For this we can use the native cluster module which creates several child processes (workers) that operate parallelly. Each generated process has it&#x27;s own event loop, V8 instance and memory. The primary process and worker process communicate with each other via IPC (Inter-Process Communication).

When deploying applications on netlify, we usually add our app’s environment variables manually. And whenever there’s a need to update it, we have to go back there to netlify to do it. With Doppler, an organization/team or individuals can manage their application’s environment variables easily. In this article, we will be learning how to integrate Doppler with Netlify.
In this article, we will clone a mini e-commerce project built with Reactjs that uses firebase for authentication from Github, save the app’s environment variables in a doppler workspace and sync it with netlify. To achieve this, we will set up a doppler account, create a workspace, add a project to the workspace and sync it with netlify.

Você pode bloquear um IP (ou faixa de IP) utilizando a diretiva deny. Além do IP, é possível também utilizar o CIDR para bloquear requisições.
# Syntax: deny address | CIDR | unix: | all;
# Default: —
# Context: http, server, location, limit_except
#
# Bloqueia um IP específico
deny 127.0.0.1;

# Bloqueia faixa 142.250.218.0 - 142.250.218.255
deny 142.250.218.0/24;

# Bloqueia uma faixa de IP do tipo IPV6
deny 2001:0db8::/32;

# Bloqueia todos os acessos
deny all;

Bloqueando acesso a arquivos
Com o deny, também é possível bloquear acesso aos arquivos ou a um diretório. Basta utilizar a diretiva dentro do contexto location, por exemplo.

as I highlighted on the Dev Interrupted Podcast , only within the last decade has it come to be widely accepted and used, though many organizations are yet to use the concept. While many people still remain skeptical of open source, its growing popularity and use is undeniable.
For many developers, open source is “the one true way”, almost a religion. Many of the world’s best and brightest developers devote themselves to creating and advancing the cause of open source projects. There are any number of foundations and organizations — from The Apache Software Foundation to the .NET Foundation — that openly support open source.

                    <span>📓 Learn how to implement login, logout, and user profiles in Android apps using Kotlin and Auth0.



  
  
  
If you’re planning to build a native Android app that requires users to log in, you should use Auth0. 
Implementing user login/logout often turns into its own project. Just implementing the many ways users want to log in can easily take a lot of time. You’d also have to deal with issues such as user management, scaling, and security, each of which could have its own article.
With Auth0 and a few lines of code, your app can have a full-featured system that supports logging in with a basic username/password combination, single sign-on and social accounts, passwordless login, biometrics, and more. You won’t have to handle the “behind the scenes” issues, either!

Hello, welcome to this week&#x27;s review. As usual, I am Habdul Hazeez.
A malware which can steal your money is not something you&#x27;ll want to hear and neither is a software bug in your favorite device. Quite frankly, these among others is what this week&#x27;s review is all about.

Conclusion
Code review is a part of regular development practices for any corporation. However, adding security elements to the code review is the most effective measure in preventing vulnerabilities, even before the first commit. Additionally, the code review process provides itself with sharing security best practices amongst a development team. Finally, it produces &#x27;lessons&#x27; that we can learn to prevent future bugs.
The primary purpose of security engineers is to work collaboratively with the rest of the team to figure out a way not to reproduce the same vulnerabilities or at least implement a mechanism to minimize them.

                    <span>To be safe on the Internet, it is essential to pass information through encrypted communication. 🔐
This is also called encrypted streams. 🔐
But how does it work all these exchanges to arrive at a result where my data is in encrypted flows and it is inviolable? 🤔
As a developer, I&#x27;m going to need to understand how all of this works so that I can implement it effectively in my app or website. 👨🏼‍💻
As a security engineer, it is essential to know how it works in order to be sure that there are no potential vulnerabilities in the implementation of my web service. 👷🏼‍♂️
As an individual &quot;general public&quot;, it is classy to know these type of things to shine in society. 😄

If you don&#x27;t know how the algorithm works checkout previous post in this series.
So Without further ado, LET&#x27;S BEGIN!!👨‍💻👩‍💻
Yes, You&#x27;re right! 
three steps:
Convert plaintext into digraphs (i.e., into pair of two letters)
Generate a Cipher Key Matrix
Encrypt plaintext using Cipher Key Matrix and get ciphertext.
 

  
  
  Step: 1 Creating function to convert plaintext into digraphs




  



 
 


  
  
  Now we need to locate index of particular character inside cipher key matrix to perform encryption:




  



 
 


  
  
  Final Step! Running our code from main method:

                    <span>Hey friends,
Over the years I have implemented service container architecture in many large-scale front-end apps and it has vastly improved their performance and maintainability. I&#x27;ve finally got around to turning it into an open-source library called &quot;Be Our Guest.&quot; The name is inspired by the Disney song from Beauty and the Beast and the lyric &quot;put our service to the test.&quot;
It is an ASYNC service container that enables your node or browser applications to implement an Inversion of Control architecture for it&#x27;s modules and dependencies. You may be thinking, &quot;why do I need this?&quot;
As an example to illustrate it&#x27;s value, let&#x27;s say we have a module that handles auth within our application. After you construct and register the module it requires a boot step to send some requests to the backend…</span>
