What is DevOps for Salesforce?

For the last two decades, Salesforce is standing strong as the leading software platform. Innovation, infrastructure management, versatility, and scalability are just a few reasons why Salesforce commands that position.
However, DevOps for Salesforce is tricky. Most of the core principles and techniques of DevOps fail with Salesforce. One of the biggest challenges Salesforce customers with complex systems face is dealing with thousands of moving parts but lack a systematic way of tracking, managing, and deploying them.
Nevertheless, with the release of Salesforce DX in 2016, a lot of teams are in the p…</span>

— Exploit Data Driven Component Layout, Loaded On-Demand in Angular
One of the fun things about being an applied mathematician in front-end development is the never-ending stream of complex, interactive problems that users wish to solve. These range from gamification of business applications to data-driven user experiences. Two interesting applications of the latter topic include dynamic routing through an application and dynamic component layout. Both are examples of user experiences that vary based on factors such as user role and prior uses of the application. In other words, two different users may be presented with an entirely different experience based on both a priori knowledge of the user and how the user interacts with the application in real tim…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
GitHub is a source code and file storage service with version control using git tool. GitHub Pages is a static file hosting service using a public repository.
Travis CI is a deployment service integrated with GitHub.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)

                    <span>Semana passada colocamos no ar a nova versão do /dev/All que mudou radicalmente sua arquitetura (detalhes não técnicos neste link): dentre as principais mudanças está o fato de que agora a interface com o usuário é um SPA. Este é o primeiro post no qual compartilho com vocês algumas das coisas que aprendi no processo.
Note que esta é a visão de alguém que tinha como ferramenta principal para o desenvolvimento de aplicações SPA o Vue.js. Sendo assim minhas impressões em sua maior parte fazem uma comparação com ele. Leve em consideração que são &quot;novas novas impressões&quot; a respeito do Angular. Muita coisa pode mudar conforme minha experiência progride.
Por que não gostava
Uma das principais razões pelas quais aprendi Vue.js, confesso, foi para não usar o Angular. Além do trauma da quebra de co…</span>

According to Flux architecture the application is split into these following components:

Actions: Action is that component of architecture where the user interacts with the application. Action contains all the information that is needed to that particular action. It has a type property that identifies the action type and helps in passing data to the dispatcher.
Dispatcher:There is always only one dispatcher that is called the global dispatcher. This dispatcher broadcasts all the actions and events to the registered stores. When the user click the send button an action is generated via dispatc…</span>

                    <span>Hi All, if you have worked on some Angular project and used backend communication with API in which want to add some auth header to every outgoing request you must have used Interceptor to achieve that.
After initial setup of Angular project lets add the below HTML code in HTML template file
Call using interceptor


Call without interceptor

And below in typescript file for our first function callWitInterceptor, for the other one we will add later in the article.
constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
callWitInterceptor() {
    this.http.get(&#x27;https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random&#x27;).subscribe();
  }

And interceptor function looks like below and it is to be added to NgModule under providers array.
intercept(request: HttpRequest, next: HttpHandler): Observable&gt; {
    console.log(&#x27;Through interceptor&#x27;)
    return next.handle(request);
  }

You can also refer StackBlitz project from below for a working example.

this. When injected, HttpBackend dispatches requests directly to the backend, without going through the interceptor chain. So as per the definition, we can surely use it for our current use case.
constructor(private http: HttpClient, private httpBackend: HttpBackend) {}
  callWithoutInterceptor() {
    this.httpBackend
      .handle(new HttpRequest(&#x27;GET&#x27;, &#x27;https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random&#x27;))
      .subscribe();
  }

Now when we click on the Button we will notice that the console is not printed but in the network tab, we can see the API call made.

Hereby using HttpBackend we were able to bypass the application-wide interceptor. Hope you found this interesting and learned something new. Please share and provide your valuable feedback. Till next time Happy Learning!</span>

Everyone has their reasons for learning a particular skill or profession. Until you know why you want to learn a skill, you would be revolving in circles.
I listed the above activities so you understand that every time you spend learning something that doesn&#x27;t worth your time and doesn&#x27;t contribute any value to you, the time wasted is irreversible.

                    <span>Nowadays, YAML is used for configuring almost everything (for better or worse), so whether you&#x27;re DevOps engineer working with Kubernetes or Ansible, or developer configuring logging in Python or CI/CD with GitHub Actions - you have to deal with YAML files at least from time-to-time. Therefore, being able to efficiently query and manipulate YAML is essential skill for all of us - engineers. The best way to learn that is by mastering YAML processing tool such as yq, which can make you way more efficient at many of your daily tasks, from simple lookups to complex manipulations. So, let&#x27;s go through and learn all that yq has to offer - including traversing, selecting, sorting, reducing and much more!

                    <span>Esse é o primeiro post de uma série sobre o Atlantis, onde o intuito é dar um mega salto no fluxo de trabalho de quem já utiliza Terraform no dia dia. Se você já:
Utiliza Terraform para criar infraestrutura
Ainda usa o Terraform local
E sente falta de um ambiente mais colaborativo para desenvolver sua infraestrutura.
Essa série é para você! 
Vamos passar por alguns pontos básicos de como a ferramenta funciona e até explorar alguns modos de deployment. Tudo isso com um repo no Github para te ajudar com configuração e exemplos.
Caso você não tenha experiência prévia com Terraform, super recomendo o conteúdo do Igor Souza no Youtube. :)
O Atlantis é uma aplicação que automatiza através de Pull Requests a forma como rodamos o Terraform. 
Gosto muito da definição do Matheus Fidelis, que o Atlan…</span>

Part 1 of our article featured more information on the security aspects for why to use one but in this article, I want to talk more about the &quot;managing&quot; of SSH keys as a reason to use one.
To define which SSH keys have access to your server, each server user has its own directory and within, a folder called .ssh. This folder should have a file called authorized_keys and the purpose of this file is to hold the public key for each SSH key that should have access.
It&#x27;s a very simple system that works great, as it&#x27;s a simple case of adding a new public key on a new line in the file and saving it, (or deleting a line to remove access).

This is Ankit, your friendly DevOps content curator. I read a lot of articles about DevOps, distributed systems, performance monitoring, etc. I will be sharing some key takeaways from these articles with you so that you can stay updated and learn a few things quickly.🙂

Best Practices for building containers
Containers are meant to be treated as a single app, and not as a virtual machine. The best practice is to have a parent process and all its child processes as a single container. If you have multiple apps in a single container, you might end up with a running container with an unresponsive core component.
Linux signals control the lifecycle of processes inside a container. And to tig…</span>

                    <span>I love writing CDK apps but there is something I really loathe: Writing IAM policies and assigning them to resources like Lambdas. It feels like a step back because I don&#x27;t have the same type-safety and syntax highlighting that I&#x27;m used to from native CDK constructs.
When I start writing an app, I want to make fast progress, so I fall back to using AWS Managed IAM policies, which are usually too broad and open. Then I add TODO&#x27;s and promise myself to take care of it later... 
Like in this example where the Lambda should only be able to read from a single bucket, but is granted with full S3 permissions:
const bucket &#x3D; new s3.Bucket(...)

const executionRole &#x3D; new iam.Role(this, &quot;execution-role&quot;, {

Yet it’s a fact that many companies don’t know how to keep track of their web application security and improve it.
Content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, Joomla and website builders have made it easy for everyone to create a website. Most of the website owners forget the fact that the attack surface of internet-facing web applications is much wider and that they need adequate security.
Whenever a customer or visitor is on your website you have to make sure that their data is safe.

Do you differentiate by contractor vs employee?
Do you take into account bathroom breaks and meetings or is that including in the calculation?
A long list of questions, and despite using Sprint Capacities for the better part of 5+ years I&#x27;ve always come to find them an imperfect science that doesn&#x27;t achieve what project planners and managers are hoping to achieve - a near perfect allocation of time applied to a sprint within a large project.
&quot;I don&#x27;t pay for your bathroom breaks&quot;

Com ele você pode:
Acompanhar qualquer aspecto relativo ao ambiente de execução do seu projeto (incluindo o estado da sua aplicação).
Executar ações remotas em seu código: pense em coisas como limpar o cache, remover arquivos temporários, executar alguma ação, enfim, qualquer coisa.
Disparar notificações para outros módulos da sua plataforma, o que possibilita a construção de uma estratégia de manutenção e monitoramento pró-ativa.

In my case, this situation occurred because I wanted to email attach multiple log files.
Let&#x27;s first look at the command itself.
zip options zip_name files

Where this works as follows:
zip: The Linux command to zip things
options: We can pass in arguments for the end zip results
zip_name: The output name, without the .zip part
files: One or more files comma separated
To show you the most simple zip command for one file, we could do this.
zip archive test.txt

This will create an archive.zip in that folder containing the test.txt file.

To install the zip command on Ubuntu or Debian systems, you can run the following command.
sudo apt install zip

LVM RAID is a method to create a logical volume (LV) which uses several physical disks to improve performance or fault tolerance. Within LVM, physical disks (abbreviated as PV, physical volumes) belong to one volume group (VG).
Although it is much safer to use MD RAID, if you really need to migrate from conventional disks to a RAID system without having to change their file systems, this method can be very useful.
Allocating information with blocks of logical volume data on physical disks is determined by a specific RAID type. Check the video link be…</span>

Okay, before starting with the actual topic, let’s discuss what makes Linux different from windows. If you are a Windows user you might have seen different drives such as C, D, E, etc which are absent in Linux instead it has folders named /bin, /sbin, /usr, /etc.
For new Linux users, let us tell you about how Linux and windows evolved. Windows was installed on top of DOS(Disk operating system), which was a command-line tool where you can run programs, games, etc. It used letters to assign removable discs such as floppy drives, i.e. A and B.

                    <span>Being used to npm based projects for years, I encountered a yarn based one yesterday. I&#x27;ve read about yarn before, but never got the chance to work on it until now. So, I searched around to find the basics to get it working. I found it to be pretty similar to npm so far, with a few changes here and there. If you&#x27;ve cloned a project repo already setup with yarn, these are the general instructions to follow:
Make sure yarn is installed globally:
npm install -g yarn

Then, move to project folder and upgrade to latest in yarn 1.x branch:
cd ~/path/to/project
yarn set version latest

Install the project dependencies:
yarn install

And the finally, build and/or run the project. Similar to npm based projects, you can check package.json file in the project folder and find the necessary commands listed there. Should be like yarn build, yarn dev, yarn start, yarn serve, etc.
Another interesting thing to keep in mind is, the yarn equivalents of npm install --save and npm install --save-dev are yarn add and yarn add --dev, respectively. I found it mentioned on the documentation page of yarn install command.
Yarn 2.x is meant to be installed per project. So, follow the same steps as yarn 1.x described above, but just before yarn set version latest, run this:
yarn set version berry

Check if yarn is on version 2.x with:
yarn --version

Now, follow the same steps for 1.x. For more info, refer to Yarn 2 docs.
If you&#x27;re like me and accidentally installed yarn 2.x on a 1.x based project 😅, don&#x27;t worry! It&#x27;s nothing a few commands can&#x27;t fix. Run:
yarn set version classic

And then follow the steps described above for yarn 1.x. The documentation page for yarn set version command describes more ways to set specific versions.

                    <span>Este final de semana resolvi mergulhar no Node.js: apesar de ser uma plataforma que acompanho desde o lançamento nunca lhe dei a devida atenção que esta merece, então resolvi corrigir esta desfeita.
Este mergulho foi uma experiência incrível, intensa e que me fez refletir sobre diversos assuntos. Aprendi horrores e então pra finalizar (dar o primeiro grande passo), nada melhor que compartilhar com vocês minhas conclusões iniciais.
Eu e o Node.js
Talvez a melhor expressão para descrever meu relacionamento com Node.js até agora seja &quot;curiosidade distante&quot;. Meu primeiro contato com a plataforma foi quando surgiu: escrevi alguns mocks de webservices e APIs REST lá pelos idos de 2009/2010.
Se não me falha a memória estes mocks foram escritos usando o módulo HTTP mesmo. Na época fiquei muito imp…</span>

                    <span>One of the first libraries I reach for when anything sort of web application is axios. Axios is an http   client for making requests in the browser and Node.js. One might ask, why not use the fetch api that is already built into all modern browsers? My answer is always interceptors. 
Having previously worked with Angular in my past jobs, one of the niceties its&#x27; built-in client offers is the ability to capture or intercept outgoing http requests. Since React doesn&#x27;t care about which libraries we use with our UI, we have to make these decisions on our own. 
This means choosing something like which http client we are using  is left to us and luckily enough there are plethora of options in the Javascript eco-system. Some of these include got, axios, superagent, needle and the built-in fetch a…</span>

                    <span>Let me tell you a story about a client.
This client was demanding. They wanted all the things, and they wanted them now.
Servers know this kind of client all too well. When the client comes in, asking for everything and the kitchen sink, a server just has to sigh.
&quot;A lot of that is just going to go to waste, you know,&quot; says the server, softly.
Their comments go unheeded.
Does this client sound familiar?
This client is your Single Page Application (SPA).
There&#x27;s a new client in town, though, and it only asks for what it needs.
This client is Next.js.
It also happens to be the server 🤔
Clients and Servers and Node Oh My


Starting with Next.js after working on SPAs can be challenging (at least it was for me) with the whole server thing going on, not to mention the node.js runtime 😱

                    <span>Mongoose is a Node.js package that gives you an interface to play with mongo database. It is very light weight npm package to use in our application. Mongoose has all sets of methods that help you to connect and access data stored in Mongo database.

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. Mongoose.js provides an abstraction layer on top of MongoDB that eliminates the need to use named collections in native MongoDB driver. Mongoose makes MongoDB easier to work with MongoDB. Mongoose allow developers to enforce a specific schema of desired object at the application layer.

                    <span>The Dev.to CLI


Hello, everyone. 
A few months ago, around the first week of December 2020, I started working on this project. The project was a CLI app which used the Dev.to API to communicate with the website. I got caught up with other things and couldn&#x27;t finish the project as I wanted to before making it public in front of the Dev.to community.
Today, I put the project in community&#x27;s hands, seeking for reviews, help and in hopes of making it better and usable.

                    <span>Slack has done a good job of documenting how to create a basic Slack app to get you over the configuration hump.  And there are some handy simple examples on Glitch which save you from having to create your own server to host the backend code.  The following blog post captures my notes on how to do the same on my local Mac using NodeJS, Slack&#x27;s Bolt JavaScript framework, and ngrok to expose the application to the internet.
There&#x27;s nothing revolutionary in the following blog post, this is just a documentation exercise so I don&#x27;t have to keep remembering every step!

                    <span>In server-side development, it&#x27;s extremely common to access variables from the execution environment. 
In this post, I hope to convince you to consolidate access of these variables into one single-file (or a more structured way of accessing these values) to make it easier to refactor, maintain, and update as your project grows.
// Logging to console the stage we&#x27;re on
console.log(&#x60;This is the ${process.env.NODE_ENV}&#x60;);

I won&#x27;t dive too much into the why of this, but you typically access sensitive values via this way, such as
API keys and secrets
Application identifiers
Stage of the environment (looking at you NODE_ENV)
JSON Web Token key
Database access credentials
other top-secret values of this nature

Nesse artigo vou abordar a criação e publicação de um package escrito em Typescript para o NPM. A minha principal motivação é escrever algo que seja simples mas não deixe de levar em consideração fatores importantes, como versionamento, atualização, testes e automatização. O que será abordado:
Criar um package em TS
Boas práticas de teste pre release
Publicar um package público no npm
Gerenciar atualizações
Noções de versionamento
Automatizar a publicação com github actions
Criar uma conta no Github

Part 1 of our article featured more information on the security aspects for why to use one but in this article, I want to talk more about the &quot;managing&quot; of SSH keys as a reason to use one.
To define which SSH keys have access to your server, each server user has its own directory and within, a folder called .ssh. This folder should have a file called authorized_keys and the purpose of this file is to hold the public key for each SSH key that should have access.
It&#x27;s a very simple system that works great, as it&#x27;s a simple case of adding a new public key on a new line in the file and saving it, (or deleting a line to remove access).

This simple program helps us learn about sockets and Client Side Architecture! Python in general is a great language to start with from beginners to advanced! And of course, it allows us to create solid applications very fast and easily. For a further challenge, you can also add custom features like chat rooms, commands, roles, send images etc…

                    <span>Web applications play a key role in determining the success of a business. Many companies solely depend on web applications for their business, offering a SaaS product for other customers and also building web apps for internal use.
Yet it’s a fact that many companies don’t know how to keep track of their web application security and improve it.
Content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, Joomla and website builders have made it easy for everyone to create a website. Most of the website owners forget the fact that the attack surface of internet-facing web applications is much wider and that they need adequate security.
Whenever a customer or visitor is on your website you have to make sure that their data is safe.

                    <span>📓 SOC 2 is a technical security audit report from the AICPA that evaluates a tech service business’s cloud security controls.


In the last two years alone, cloud-based cyberattacks more than doubled — even though SaaS spending grew just 18%. 
While these numbers are merely a correlation from a statistical standpoint, it does indicate that if your business stores customer data in the cloud, it’s more important than ever for your business to take measures to secure that data. Especially given SaaS spending is expected to increase an additional 36% between 2020 and 2022. 
A SOC 2 certification from the AICPA is a foundational step that will help every service provider reduce security risks. Below is a guide to SOC 2 compliance requirements and certification.
SOC 2 is an independent audit report that evaluates the security controls a tech service business uses to protect the data they process in the cloud. Possession of a SOC 2 report is considered table stakes in the SaaS industry, as the answers to most security questions a customer may have about their business’s security posture can usually be pulled from this report.
“SOC” stands for “System and Organization Controls” and was created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). SOC 2 is one of three SOC reports, each with different purposes and/or levels of transparency:
SOC 1. Used to audit internal controls relevant to a customer’s financial systems. Report usage is “restricted,” meaning its use is limited to auditors, the service organization, and authorized users.
SOC 2. Used to audit the overall management of customer data. Report usage is also “restricted” the same way SOC 1 is.
SOC 3. The same as SOC 2, but the report is simplified and publicly available to increase transparency.

LVM RAID is a method to create a logical volume (LV) which uses several physical disks to improve performance or fault tolerance. Within LVM, physical disks (abbreviated as PV, physical volumes) belong to one volume group (VG).
Although it is much safer to use MD RAID, if you really need to migrate from conventional disks to a RAID system without having to change their file systems, this method can be very useful.
Allocating information with blocks of logical volume data on physical disks is determined by a specific RAID type. Check the video link be…</span>

                    <span>Sometimes when writing an app in React you might have a component that changes its look and logic dramatically depending on provided props. In addition, if a particular prop provided, the other props become either required or restricted. That hidden prop relation can be explained in documentation but if your project uses Typescript there is a great opportunity to utilize what I call &quot;sets of props&quot;.
It&#x27;s usually not the best idea to make buttons look like links and vice versa but let&#x27;s ignore this for the sake of clarity. The code snippet below is so-called Clickable component which can be either a link or a button that shares the same style but has different behavior depending on props.
import { ReactNode } from &#x27;react&#x27;

interface BaseProps {
  children: ReactNode
}

interface AsButtonProps extends BaseProps {
  as: &#x27;button&#x27;
  onClick: () &#x3D;&gt; void
  href?: never
}

interface AsLinkProps extends BaseProps {
  as: &#x27;a&#x27;
  href: string
  onClick?: never
}

type ClickableProps &#x3D; AsButtonProps | AsLinkProps

const Clickable &#x3D; ({ children, as, onClick, href }: ClickableProps) &#x3D;&gt; {
  return (
    
      {as &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;a&#x27; &amp;&amp; (
        {children}
      )}

      {as &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;button&#x27; &amp;&amp; (
        {children}
      )}
    
  )
}

export default Clickable

The component has four props. children is required in any case so it&#x27;s put under the BaseProps interface. Both AsButtonProps and AsLinkProps extended from BaseProps and represent two sets of props. The active set depends on the value of the as prop while the type never for unused props makes sure that Typescript will yell if someone is using a prop which does nothing.
Here is a scheme:

This pattern is obviously not limited to props in React. It&#x27;s widely used in the types of various npm packages. Now you can add it to your arsenal and build reusable components/utils with better API for you and your team.

— Exploit Data Driven Component Layout, Loaded On-Demand in Angular
One of the fun things about being an applied mathematician in front-end development is the never-ending stream of complex, interactive problems that users wish to solve. These range from gamification of business applications to data-driven user experiences. Two interesting applications of the latter topic include dynamic routing through an application and dynamic component layout. Both are examples of user experiences that vary based on factors such as user role and prior uses of the application. In other words, two different users may be presented with an entirely different experience based on both a priori knowledge of the user and how the user interacts with the application in real tim…</span>

                    <span>When looking for bookmarks or code snippets I recently used, I often find myself use the autocompletion capability of the search box to retrieve them. So over the weekend, I figured out since I do that, why not make it easier. So I did - I added sort of quick access to my last searches directly in the side menu on the landing page. See it in action below:

One tricky part was how to show the whole content of the search query when its length passes a certain limit. That meant when hovering over it, dynamically change the content of the html anchor a element. On top of that the list is dynamically generated out of the last searches. I like challenges and I described in How to change the content of an html element on hover in Angular how I implemented this.
Another interesting aspect of the implementation was how to dynamically set the background color of the displayed search queries - this is described with the snippets and post at Set css class dynamically in Angular from expression

                    <span>Introduction:


There are multiple frameworks being invented for the purpose of simplifying the web development process. It helps increase flexibility and reduces launch time. Without frameworks, modern web development would not be possible as they need to create databases, security options, and various other things from the start.
In this blog, we are talking about, 

Angular was released in 2016 by Google. It is one of the most popular frameworks, and it is best suited for high-performance web and mobile apps as well as complex e-commerce projects. It is not a complete stack platform and can be used for front-end development for client-side applications. Angular uses Typescript front-end technologies, a JavaScript framework superset, along with HTML and CSS. 
It is used by companies like…</span>

It is a good practice to have some sort of mocking mechanism so we can start coding as soon as we can and also make our unit testing less error prone by using well known data.
Yes, but that sounds overly complicated to achieve. We need to turn off and on the backend, swap modules around to enable or disable the mocking and be careful to not deploy any of that the production.
Well, not anymore.
MSW as they say, is the API mocking of the next generation. Right, but what does that mean? It works by intercepting requests on the network level or in other words, by using a service worker.

                    <span>tree in Linux


tree command helps to recursively list the directory and its details in a tree format. In this post, we will see how you can use tree effectively to view the directory details.
tree essentials in Linux


To install tree in Ubuntu, Debian Linux distros.
sudo apt-get install tree

To install tree in CentOS:
sudo yum install tree

In Windows, you can issue tree in Windows Terminal.
tree


If you enter tree command without any arguments, it will list out everything from the current directory recursively. Suppose, if you are in your home directory, it will display everything recursively like below.

man tree

.





tree -a

tree -d

tree -f

tree -L 1


tree -P b*


tree backups -P &#x27;SMTP*&#x27;


&#x27;*&#x27; - any zero or more characters
&#x27;?&#x27; - any single character
&#x27;[...]&#x27; - any single character listed between brackets
&#x27;[A-Z]&#x27; - for range
&#x27;[^...]&#x27;- any single character not listed in brackets
&#x27;|&#x27; - separates alternate patterns
tree backups -I &#x27;SMTP*&#x27;


If you use -P which matches both the directories and files. If the match is found for directories, then the matching is disabled for its contents. Use it with --prune to prune it.

To not to print the file and directory report, use --noreport.
tree bin -P &#x27;*.log&#x27; --prune --noreport 

tree bin -P &#x27;*.log&#x27; --prune -J

tree bin -P &#x27;*.log&#x27; --prune -X

tree bin -P &#x27;*.log&#x27; --prune -D

tree bin/ -P &#x27;*.properties&#x27; --prune -h


-F marks directories as * and / for files.
tree -P &#x27;*.jmx&#x27; --prune -F


It displays directories first over files. To disable, use -U.
tree -P &#x27;*.jtl&#x27; --prune --dirsfirst



In this post, we have covered frequently used tree commands. Please check my blog for more such tutorials.

Vim is quite a powerful text editor which can add performance to the already fast typed language Python. Vim can be highly customizable and efficient to use as it has the power of adding custom plugins and plugins managers, key mappings, and the most critical weapon of vim - Access to the terminal straight away.
So let us start making Vim, the text editor suitable for a python programmer. Firstly we&#x27;ll need the vim plugin manager. There are different plugin managers out there, each of them has the same purpose to install, upgrade and manage the plugins for vim. You can install any one of them and get up and running.

A QNAP NAS storage system consists of several hard disks. To improve resilience and data safety, such devices enable you to create RAID systems of various types. However, even the most reliable storage systems may encounter emergencies like accidental deletion of files, formatting or damaging the hard disk, system errors, controller failures and other hardware issues, which may result in loss of important data.

If NAS works properly and you just removed some important files by accident, you can try restoring them from the Network Recycle Bin.

                    <span>In Linux systems, by default, the history does not include a timestamp, which can be annoying when you want to see when a command was executed to determine an update or some kind.
So today, I&#x27;ll be showing you how to enable timestamps for the bash history in Linux.
Before we get started, let&#x27;s look at how the history works and which files are attached.
The bash history is kept so we can retrieve whatever actions some user did.
To retrieve this history, we can type the following command.
history

It should come back with something that looks like this.

To find where this file is located you can run the following command.
echo $HISTFILE

It will generally come back with a location like:
/root/.bash_history

However, to change the history output, we have to make a change in the configuration settings.
These configuration settings are set in a file called .bashrc.
We need to add the HISTTIMEFORMAT config settings, which will change the output.
There are two ways to include this in your .bashrc file.
Manually open the .bashrc file and paste it in.
Echo it into the file.




# method 1
nano ~/.bashrc
# now paste:
export HISTTIMEFORMAT&#x3D;&quot;%F %T &quot;

# method 2
echo &#x27;export HISTTIMEFORMAT&#x3D;&quot;%F %T &quot;&#x27; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc

The format we are using includes the %F and %T variables which stand for:
%F: full date (year-month-day)
%T: time (hour:minute:seconds)
Now you won&#x27;t see the change yet. We have to enable it, which we can do by rebooting or simply running this command:
source ~/.bashrc

Now when we run the history command, we should see something like this.

As you can see, we now have timestamps in front of our history!

                    <span>A while ago, Node.js introduced support for ECMAScript Modules (ESM). ESM is the standardized modules implementation that&#x27;s been built-in to JavaScript. This differs rather significantly from CommonJS (CJS), which is the module system that Node.js has shipped with for over a decade that make them relatively incompatible.
There are a number of different components of Node.js that have been intentionally structured to allow you to use standard (as in, how the ECMAScript Specification defines it) ESM by default and extend/augment that experience if you&#x27;d like to.
Today, I want to get into one of the baisc elements of ESM in Node.js: the .mjs and .cjs extensions.

                    <span>Best Practices


Forgive me, the Bart Simpson in me couldn&#x27;t resist using &#x27;Best Practices&#x27; once again. Sure, there&#x27;s a lot to say to stamp out “best practice” and I agree with most arguments in the article. Framing something as a best practice is subjective, and it could give the impression of being arrogant. But, as grown-ups, I&#x27;m convinced most of us know how to deal with the term and see why it&#x27;s used. So pick the practices you agree on, which you see as &#x27;best&#x27; practices yourself.
I have the feeling that the importance of API Gateway in a setup is sometimes overlooked. AWS wrote down the practices themselves (also using the term &#x27;Best practices 😉). But IMHO, their documentation is a tad too brief. Also, the documentation lacks a &#x27;WHY&#x27; in general.

                    <span>📓 HIPAA and HITECH both provide legal guidelines for managing protected health information in the United States. Here is what businesses need to know to comply.


If your business processes protected health information (PHI) in the United States, you’ll need to familiarize yourself with both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act.
Both pieces of legislation provide legal guidelines for managing PHI in the United States and come with strict penalties for violations. For example, two health care networks were fined $5.5M each in two of the worst violations in recent history.
However, each law manages and protects health data in different ways (and for different reasons). Below is a summary of what each law could mean for your business if it processes PHI in any format.

HIPAA and HITECH are two separate laws with two different goals:
HIPAA was passed in 1996 and was the first U.S. law to regulate how protected health information was managed. It introduced a set of security controls and privacy rights aimed at reducing fraud and waste in health care. HIPAA defined who was required to comply with its regulations (which HIPAA called “covered entities”) and how they were required to do so in order to protect health data.
The HITECH Act was passed in 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to encourage HIPAA-covered entities to adopt electronic health records (EHRs) for managing PHI. It offered financial incentives from 2011 to 2015 to transition to EHRs and to improve the delivery of healthcare. The HITECH Act also introduced new technical security standards (in addition to a few other things below) that complement and enhance HIPAA as well.

                    <span>I am fresh off the AWS Security Specialty exam for 2021 having successfully sat for the exam last week. What a doozy! I&#x27;ve 4 other AWS certifications and for me, personally I found this one to be the most challenging. I do practice security in my day to day to ensure I am building secure systems and enjoy discussing designs with security professionals but I&#x27;m not in a dedicated security team or SysOps role so I&#x27;m not living and breathing security everyday.
In this post I&#x27;ll give you a run down on the exam, what you can expect on the day and what materials I used to prepare for the exam.
As usual the official AWS doco gives you the best info on the exam. It&#x27;s basically an exam for security professionals (shocker), so, think security in transit, rest, shared responsibility model, users, desi…</span>

                    <span>For a while Ive been interested in not only Rust but WASM but having limited familiarity with many of the languages that can be compiled to WASM I never really had a chance to try it out until recently. Over the last few months though I got the opportunity to learn Rust.
Rust in my opinion is very much like typescript on steroids. While Typescript may enforce types in your code if you happen to pass a string to a type expecting a number things will still compile and may even work as expected still. With Rust this is not the case. If you provide an unexpected type either things will not compile in the first place or your software will crash.

                    <span>Imagine you have a JavaScript code like this:
const someObj &#x3D; { tags: [], packages: [] };
function hasValue(key, item) {
  return someObj[key].indexOf(item) !&#x3D;&#x3D; -1;
}

And you are porting this this into TypeScript. You are trying to follow best practices, like using strict mode. And don’t want to use any and unsafe casts. so you start adding types:
type SomeType &#x3D; {
  tags: (string | number)[];
  packages: string[];
};
const someObj: SomeType &#x3D; { tags: [], packages: [] };

This was easy, but then you hit one issue that you can’t really write type for hasValue without using some sort of casting. This is your best attempt:
function hasValue(key: K, item: SomeType[K]) {
  return someObj[key].indexOf(item) !&#x3D;&#x3D; -1;

Firstly, go to your terminal and navigate to the directory where you&#x27;d like to create your express app, type npx express-generator, hit enter you should see a structure like this automatically generated for you.

                    <span>Query Keys are a very important core concept in React Query. They are necessary so that the library can internally cache your data correctly and refetch automatically when a dependency to your query changes. Lastly, it will allow you to interact with the Query Cache manually when needed, for example when updating data after a mutation or when you need to manually invalidate some queries.
Let&#x27;s quickly have a look what these three points mean before I&#x27;ll show you how I personally organize Query Keys to be able to do these things most effectively.
Internally, the Query Cache is just a JavaScript object, where the keys are serialized Query Keys and the values are your Query Data plus meta information. The keys are hashed it in a deterministic way, so you can use objects as well (on the top le…</span>

Node.js installation steps depend on your system — just proceed to a download page and follow instructions.
npm doesn&#x27;t need any installation because it comes with Node. If you wish to check that everything is properly installed on your system, follow these instructions.
Sidenote: npm is not the only package manager, there&#x27;s also Yarn. If uncertain, I&#x27;d recommend staying with npm.

I just can&#x27;t stop writing these generic functions! This is another powerful generic function that follows my previous post on building a generic function to update an array at a specific key according to a specific test value. As I try and maintain the cleanest codebase as possible for ReduxPlate, I continue to find new use cases for these easy-to-use yet powerful generic functions.
Often when doing state modifications, you want to merge or add some properties to an object that you get from an API or some other source. You could explicitly write key / value assignments for the keys that you want to update... or you can leverage JavaScript&#x27;s built in Object.assign function and TypeScript&#x27;s generic capabilities to only write one such function fo…</span>

In this post I will expand on the previous post and show how Linux-specific and Windows-specific code can be developed and unit tested.  In addition I will take a look at xUnit test fixtures, Windows ACLs and Linux file permissions.
As in the last post, the approach is to develop code on Windows and test in Linux containers.  So on your windows dev box the set up you need is Hyper-V and Docker. 

Also needed are the dotnet CLI and VS Code for this optimum (in my view) setup.

...Arthur C. Clarke
This article is part of what I call the magical directives series. In this series, we will unravel the mystery behind some interesting Angular directives. Afterwards, we can add this little magic to our tool box. I call them magical directives because they play a very important role in building reusable components across our Angular applications.
Below are the directives that we will be looking at in this series.
ng-template
ng-container
ng-content
*ngTemplateOutlet
The ng-template directive simply represent an Angular template. Angular uses the ng-template under the hood in our structural directives( *ngIf, *ngFor) and ngSwitch. The ngSwitch controls the structural directives (*ngSwitchCase and *ngSwitchDefault ) and …</span>

Previously, I had used AWS SAM to build a CRUD app for notes. Recently, I wanted to learn more about the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), GraphQL, and AWS AppSync, so I decided to refactor my original project.
Disclaimer that at the time of writing the CDK v2 is in developer preview. This blog post will use CDK v1.
If you want to skip ahead, take a look the finished project here.
If this is your first time using the CDK, bootstrap your AWS account. The Prerequisites section in this guide has the steps.
Start by installing the CDK npm package and running the cdk init command. This is helpful because it gives you a directory structure along with a very minimal stack to get started.

                    <span>Hey peeps!



  
  
  The following is a blog on core types in typescript that are not there in JavaScript for beautiful devs. You should have  a proper knowledge of &#x27;vanilla&#x27; JavaScript.



  
  
  The following are the steps to setup the dev environment {


• install node 
to compile the file and automatically you should have a JavaScript file created 
• enables you to add multiple values in one variable


• allows you to add multiple core types


 • enum helps you delaring set of named constants


}


  
  
  Nice!

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>
