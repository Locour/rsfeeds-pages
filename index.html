Agregar encabezados http en la solicitud http y luego evaluar ese encabezado en el interceptor.
Crear un nuevo httpClient para esa solicitud.

I was perplexed.
I know there used to be a need for trackBy.
Experience has shown me little need for it&#x27;s use recently.
Some quick research said that it is only needed if there are issues with performance with modern Angular.
So, I decided to test this out myself.
In my first iteration of testing, I tested loading data to see if there was a difference in load times when displaying them with and without the trackBy. Here are the first set of tests I ran that showed some hopeful results.
Basically, the data was 100,000 records with:

Imagine que voc√™ utilize uma API Rest de um servi√ßo qualquer, seja ele criado internamente na empresa que voc√™ trabalha, seja ele de terceiros e que esse servi√ßo ofere√ßa um endpoint para homologa√ß√£o e outro para produ√ß√£o.
Uma abordagem inicial seria trocar os valores dessa api todas as vezes que quisermos publicar nossa aplica√ß√£o em produ√ß√£o.
Uma abordagem muito mais elegante √© configurar as vari√°veis de ambiente para que voc√™ n√£o tenha que lembrar de trocar o conte√∫do de nenhuma vari√°vel.
Aqui mostro como fazer isso utilizando o recurso de configura√ß√£o de ambiente do Angular.
Projetos criados com Angular CLI possuem por padr√£o um arquivo de configura√ß√£o chamado environment.ts dispon√≠vel na pasta environments da sua aplica√ß√£o.

environment.ts:
export const environment &#x3D; {
  production: false
};

environment.prod.ts
export const environment &#x3D; {
  production: true
};

Veja um exemplo de como usar o environment.
import { environment } from &#x27;../environments/environment&#x27;;

Site reliability engineering (SRE) is a software engineering (developer) approach to IT operations (ops). SRE teams manage systems, handle scale, firefight incidents/problems and automate some operational tasks.
SRE was coined by the Google engineering team, when they realized that the duties and responsibilities required had deviated significantly from traditional IT/DevOps. One of the key differences is the use of code to help solve problems within cloud-native systems and infrastructure.
Any system that requires high availability and/or scalability needs SRE as a dedicated practice.
SRE can also stand for site reliability engineer, which are the individuals who handle site reliability engineering. SREs perform many tasks and are focused on the production cloud environment‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>We often hear SRE and DevOps interchangeably used to describe operational activities done by engineers for applications running in private or public cloud environments. What‚Äôs the difference?
From Wikipedia
DevOps brought a change to this culture that brings the responsibility of building and running software to both dev and ops, with increasing collaboration and shared responsibility across various aspects of software development life cycle (code, build, test, deploy and management)
The field of site reliability engineering (SRE) originated at Google with Ben Treynor Sloss, who founded a site reliability team after joining the company in 2003. The Google SRE books have formalized many of the ideas that are developed in these site reliability teams since then.
Unlike DevOps, SRE is both a job function and a set of principles that are followed by a team to achieve high reliability for software services offered by a company to its customers. SRE also brought engineering principles of writing ‚Äúinfrastructure-as-code‚Äù, testing and deploying operational software similar to how product services are developed.
For an in-depth explanation of ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs SRE‚Äù, check out our other blog on www.Fylamynt.com

You may be a new SRE, or switched companies and things aren‚Äôt being treated in the same way. The good news is you‚Äôve come to the right place. The bad news is you won‚Äôt be leaving with a definitive answer.
Incident response and incident management are defined differently by different organizations around the world. Doing a google on incident response vs incident management brings up an article from the UK NCSC. In this article, they state:
Incident Management (IM) sits within and across any response process, ensuring all stages are handled. IM deals with any communications, media handling, escalations and any reporting issues, pulling t‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>I recently needed to stand up a test consul cluster, and I thought it might be useful to share my notes. Here&#x27;s what you can do to quickly get a consul cluster going...
First, create an IAM role named consul and attach the AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess policy to the role.
Next, boot three Ubuntu instances, assigning the just-created role to them as the IAM role, and the following user data:
#!/bin/bash

curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-add-repository &quot;deb [arch&#x3D;amd64] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main&quot;
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install consul

echo &quot;datacenter &#x3D; \&quot;$(ec2metadata --public-hostname | cut -d. -f2)\&quot;&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/consul.d/consul.hcl 
echo &#x27;server &#x3D; true&#x27; &gt;&gt; /etc/consul.d/consul.hcl
echo &#x27;bootstrap_expect &#x3D; 3&#x27; &gt;&gt; /etc/consul.d/consul.hcl
echo &#x27;retry_join &#x3D; [&quot;provider&#x3D;aws tag_key&#x3D;Role tag_value&#x3D;consul&quot;]&#x27; &gt;&gt; /etc/consul.d/consul.hcl

systemctl start consul

This will install the latest consul on each of the instances, configure consul to operate in server mode, and bootstrap the cluster.
You also want to add the Role tag with the value of consul to the instances. This is how the instances will find each other to form a cluster.
After you boot the instances, edit the security group to allow inbound traffic from the security group (so the instances can connect to each other).
Once those steps are done, you can confirm the cluster is working by connecting to any of the instances and running consul members. You should see the three instances listed as servers.
Now you can use your consul cluster by pointing consul clients at the private IP of any of the instances.</span>

                    <span>As your cluster grows, so does the number of resources, volumes or other API objects and sooner or later you will reach the limits somewhere. Whether it&#x27;s etcd, volumes, memory or CPU. Why subject yourself to unnecessary pain and trouble when you can setup simple, yet sophisticated rules, automation and monitoring that can keep you cluster tidy and clean without rogue workloads eating your resources or stale objects lying around?
Some forgotten Pods, unused persistent volume, Completed Jobs or maybe old ConfigMap/Secret doesn&#x27;t matter, or does it? It&#x27;s just sitting there and I might need it at some point!
Well, it isn&#x27;t causing any damage right now, but when things accumulate over time they start having impact on cluster performance and stability. So, let&#x27;s look at some common/basic issues‚Ä¶</span>

In a previous article, I demonstrated the use of GitHub webhooks in a simple tutorial using a sample API that logged webhook events. In this article, we will learn how to debug common issues with GitHub webhooks using the same sample project. This time, I have introduced some bugs into the project that we are going to learn how to debug.
To begin there are a few things you need to have or set up, including: 
A GitHub repository
Node.js installed on your system to run the sample project
A publicly accessible URL to the API endpoint. We will use the Hookdeck CLI to achieve this. To install the Hookdeck CLI, check out this page.
Clear visualization of error messages. The Hookdeck CLI will help us with event pages where error details can be inspected.

                    <span>One of the most important command line utility in Linux is sed which is a stream editor.
Essentially what it can do is it allows you to search for String of text or specific pattern and then replace it pattern with whatever you tell sed to replace with, so it is really kind of search and replace function.
sed &#x27;s/find/replace/&#x27; 
newfile

So we are telling sed that go search for the word find then replace it with the word replace and what it does is it searches every lines for its first instance of the word find. So it not gonna replace every instances of find, only the first time it appears on each line from oldfile and then writes it to newfile.
Sometimes you want to replace every find in oldfile you just need to add global substitution g for every instances find.

One of my most popular posts of all time was when I wrote about my beautiful Linux development machine in 2019. Since I got a new machine and a new setup, it naturally calls for a follow-up.
By now, I&#x27;m a die-hard Linux user. It&#x27;s been five years since I&#x27;m using Linux as my primary OS. I would take a Linux machine any day over macOS or Windows. I own a Windows gaming PC and a Macbook pro from work. Still, they are nowhere near the Linux experience, personally for me. My primary driver is my Linux laptop, and I can&#x27;t be any happier with it (well, I can, I&#x27;ll come to that at the end of the post).

                    <span>In this post, I will introduce how to set up the most basic Express server in Node.JS, and how to see that your server is ready to accept requests. We will also use CodePen to write a fetch GET request to your server so you can see a basic request and response from a frontend (built with CodePen) to a backend (built with Replit).
Replit.com and Codepen.io are tools I use all the time when I want to test some code or play around with something. If you want to practice writing HTTP requests, this is a great way to get you set up to do that.
Go to Replit. Click on the Create Repl button. Search templates for Node.js. Replit will assign a random name to your repl but you can change it to whatever makes sense to you.
Now we will set up the Express server.

The Node.js runtime allows developers to build both front and backend applications using only JavaScript. This means no more context switching between different languages like PHP for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend. Once seen as a toy language for amateurs, Node has revolutionized the web.
Node also helps frontend developers because, if you were a developer before Node was introduced, you had to learn a completely different language to write server side code like PHP. Thanks to Node and its huge ecosystem, frontend developers are able to work with the backend with JavaScript as well.
With Node, you can create production-ready applications ranging from real time chat applications, and microservices, to command line tools, web servers, and APIs. Node‚Ä¶</span>

Well, it is no news for us that developing software is expensive, and takes A LOT of time and effort, after all, we&#x27;re talking about code, good code.
It is that kind of code which solves a problem, and it does so while being elegant and readable... But doing that is hard, and here is where we touch the surface of a difficult problem.
Good code is really expensive, and inaccessible for most people and companies.
Not only bad/faulty code often fails to solve the problem it should, it also becomes the own problem. I bet you once had to understand the incredibly messy class system of a legacy code base, just because you were tasked to fix a &quot;simple&quot; bug.
I have a fun personal theory, that all ever created about code can be somewhat traced back to the code accessibility problem, w‚Ä¶</span>

Resty is what I think is the best way I&#x27;d like to write RESTful APIs in Node. It borrows some of its syntax from the fetch API and it is of course type-safe. Let me show you how I&#x27;d like to write my endpoints.

Having an endpoint of about three lines of code is pretty nice to me, specially because there&#x27;s type-safety involved. Take a closer look at request.json and request.query. They both require a typed function to be passed in. If the validation fails, a 400 Bad Request error is returned with a detailed explanation of what we‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Hello Guys, I hope All of you doing well.
Sometimes we want to measure our code to check how much time it took to work, Moreover, after improving the code we&#x27;d like to check if it works more efficiently than the older version, Or for academic purpose we want to compare algorithms to check the time complexity on a chart, For that reason I Present you YubaPerf
npm i @youba/yubaperf
# OR
yarn add @youba/yubaperf

To measure your code, you need to use these functions:
perf.start(&quot;Algorithm1&quot;);
//The code you want to measure
perf.end(&quot;Algorithm1&quot;);
console.log(perf.result(&quot;Algorithm1&quot;));

The concept here is to pass one or more than function with multiple args to measure and compare between them,
You simply need:
perfom.setfuncsToCompareSync([addUpToFirst, addUpToSecond], args);
perfom.generateChart(); // the chart located on perf/index.html file

Passing Array of functions &amp; Another one for arguments .the arguments may be a simple Array like :
[1,10,1000,1000,122] Or dimensional one for Functions who has more than input like [[&#x27;yes&#x27;,19],[&#x27;yes&#x27;,1900],[&#x27;yes&#x27;,19999]]
The Chart: 

The lib is on development,the next version will have more features like: 
Comparing async functions
setfuncsToCompareSync Return an object of the result 
...

If you want to start your own blog, or just want to learn a cool CMS platform, then you should check out Strapi. Strapi is an open-source Node.js headless CMS. This means that you set up Strapi and plug it into any frontend or system you have.
In this tutorial we&#x27;ll first look at why you should use Strapi, how to set it up from scratch, then we&#x27;ll use one of Strapi&#x27;s starters to easily create a blog with Next.js.
Headless APIs provide you with a lot of flexibility. When you want to develop a system with different components, you don&#x27;t have to worry about finding one framework or programming language that you can use to be able to implement all the components.

                    <span>Hi, I tried to create index with (search-index npm module) with a different backend (AWS -S3 bucket) using the s3leveldown module as a DB store option. The Index is being created, but while querying using _SEARCH/ QUERY methods, the result set is inappropriate. Like for eg, when I initialise the DB with the S3 bucket and use the PUT method to add documents, where my text is &quot;Final is the file name&quot;.. and &quot;what is the version&quot; . This is how its created ::
current Indexed one:: { key: &#x27;description:file#0.60&#x27;, value: [ &#x27;1635744247556-1-1&#x27; ] }.
I am able to see the above in my store, when I do a createReadStream. But when my search keyword is &quot;version&quot;, my expected result should be only the 2nd indexed document. But it gives me both 1st and 2nd.I tried using both _SEARCH/ QUERY methods, but both r giving same wrong/additional results.
https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/search-index/blob/master/test/src/memdown-test.js .
Can someone guide on the correct approach for implementing other backend store options like AWS-S3 ?</span>

                    <span>Summary I have made my alternative finding different pitfalls. Meanwhile We were applying the library start-server-and-test to our solution. Surprisingly  start-server-and-test covered all pitfalls. The solution solves the problem.
  
It is a simple script and we need to understand it. It does how it is written. It runs the server and then tests it. For details check the documentation page of start-server-and-test
Pitfalls:
All processes have to be ordered.
Pipes have to be disposable to be finished.
Tests need to know when the server starts to start testing.
The script has to know when tests are finished to terminate all processes.
It takes only three parameters:
The first: To run the server.
The second: Server path. Address to wait for its availability.
The third: Test commands.
How it works
P.S. It should help you to start using the script faster.</span>

zlog that prevent outputting secret values to the log.
https://github.com/m-mizutani/zlog
It is common for many server-side services, including web services, to output and record logs about the behavior of the service. By continuously outputting logs, they can be used for troubleshooting, debugging, responding to security incidents, auditing, and clues for performance improvement. The more information contained in the log, the more clues to solve problems, so it is useful to post as much information as possible (although there is a limit), or to be able to increase the amount of information through configuration.
On the other hand, however, there is some information that is undesirable to output on the server side.

I couldn&#x27;t find a complete example of Next.js authentication with next-iron-session so I used all the little pieces I found online and created one to share.
Before talking about authentication we need to setup the model of the User. To do this we will be using mongoose for flexibility and ease of usage. You can ignore the usage of httpStatus and APIError. Here is the user.model.js inside a models folder at root level.
import mongoose from &#x27;mongoose&#x27;;
import httpStatus from &#x27;http-status&#x27;;
import APIError from &#x27;@/lib/APIError&#x27;;

                    <span>Welcome


Here&#x27;s a quick introduction/presentation so you know what this is and why you&#x27;re reading it. I&#x27;m Merk, a Software Engineering student that really likes reverse engineering (among other things).
In this series we will attempt to reverse engineer and complete challenges from the Reversing.kr website. In this particular case, we will be reversing the password of the challenge Easy Crack.
We&#x27;re given a Windows executable and must crack it. Using DIE we can see it is a 32-bit executable and is not packed.



We could straight up patch the program so that the flow of execution skips the error message and goes to the right place
This would be the cracker&#x27;s way; not the reverser&#x27;s, and would also not give us points since we don&#x27;t reverse engineer the password ;)
We could look for string references
Given that the executable doesn&#x27;t seem to have any protections, and knowing the string &quot;Incorrect Password&quot;, this method can prove to be useful 
We could set a breakpoint on the Win32 API GetDlgItemText/A/W
Because of how the program window looks, it is very likely that the Dialog reads its content using this function
We&#x27;ll test our luck looking for string references. Let&#x27;s fire up x64dbg, attach the executable and look for strings in the main module.

&quot;Congratulation !!&quot; - the good boy
&quot;Incorrect Password&quot; - the bad boy




returns 1, and makes the flow end up executing the bad boy. Taking a look inside, we can see it compares [EBP+C] which contains &quot;5y&quot; with our string starting from the third letter, which is stored in ESI. This is done via &quot;repe cmpsb&quot;, which essentially compares several characters.



return 0, and the flow of execution gets further into the program.

&quot;R3versing&quot; is stored in ESI before some comparisons.</span>

ifconfig, 
ping, 
traceroute, 
port scans (including SYN, TCP, UDP, ACK, comprehensive scan), 
host discovery (scan for up devices on a local network), 
MAC address detection (get MAC address of a host IP on a local network), 
banner grabbing, 
DNS checks (with geolocation information), 
WHOIS, 
subdomain enumeration, 
vulnerability reconnaissance, - 
packet sniffing, 
MAC spoofing, 
IP spoofing, 
SYN flooding, 
deauth attack, 
brute-force attack (beta).
Other features are still being implemented. Future implementations may include WAF detection, DNS enumeration, traffic analysis, XSS vulnerability scanner, ARP cache poisoning, DNS cache poisoning, MAC flooding, ping of death, network disassociation attack (not deauth attack), OSINT, exploits, some automated tasks and others.

Reading the content of the page, at the first glance, it tells us that there is a query parameter called html, which is capable of define partially what&#x27;s displayed to the user. When we define, for example, a 
 tag to this parameter, we are going to get returned a page with this tag being reflected, which is already an HTML injection. From now on, we will be working to make it become an XSS.

If we simply try to inject something like alert(document.domain);, this script tag will be reflected, but the code itself will not be executed. Why? Well, if we look at the head of the page, we are going to find something interesting:

The UA-parser security issue highlights two major things for the npm ecosystem:
The dependency tree comes with security risks. Your direct dependencies might not be malicious, but your dependencies of direct dependencies may be targeted. These transitive dependencies often range in hundreds and are large weak points. 
Organizations need to expand the scope of security and protect more than the CI/CD. Developer environments are often more numerous and more difficult to control, making it a ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>PiHole is a great tool for blocking ads across an entire network. However, the web-based administration panel defaults to connecting to HTTP over port 80. As a network engineer, it has always bothered me that I had to pass a password into the pi-hole I&#x27;ve always had it on my list to update Pi-hole to use HTTPS and I could not find any documentation.
Disclaimer: configure to meet your own baseline for security standards, the examples given are generic.
Raspberry Pi
Pi-hole installed
Backup of your configuration
a. Create the self signed certificate:
openssl req -new -x509 -keyout pihole.pem -out pihole.pem -days 365 -nodes

b. Change permissions to read-only:
chmod 400 pihole.pem

a. Create and move cert into Lighttpd:
sudo mkdir /etc/lighttpd/certs
mv pihole.pem /etc/lighttpd/certs/pihole.pem

b. Configure Lighttpd to accept HTTPS requests: sudo vim /etc/lighttpd/external.conf
An example configuration would be for my Pi-hole DNS address at pihole.example.com:
$HTTP[&quot;host&quot;] &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;pihole.example.com&quot; {
  # Ensure the Pi-hole Block Page knows that this is not a blocked domain
  setenv.add-environment &#x3D; (&quot;fqdn&quot; &#x3D;&gt; &quot;true&quot;)

  # Enable the SSL engine with a LE cert, only for this specific host
  $SERVER[&quot;socket&quot;] &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;:443&quot; {

                    <span>Hey guys,
It was Halloween day, but in this self-restraint mode, it&#x27;s hard to go out and enjoy dressing up in costumes.
Halloween has already passed, but you can even enjoy this app!

URL: https://ohmyface.ai/
The usage is as shown in the following slide.

First, when you visit to https://ohmyface.ai/, you can choose a favorite style from this week&#x27;s popularity ranking or the overall ranking.

This ranking is based on the number of styles converted, and is updated daily at 9pm (JTC).
Once you have selected a style, all you have to do is just upload the image you want!
Don&#x27;t worry, the uploaded images are not retained by the server.
The configuration is as follows.
Backend...python
In order to develop the ranking, I created an API to post which style the image was converted in, along with a timestamp, then store the data in dynamo.
In order to aggregate the data, I create a Lambda function that returns the style data sorted by the number of conversions, and save the results in another table in dynamo.
Then, I also created an API to access the dynamo table where the aggregate results are stored and retrieve the data, and call it from the client side to display the ranking order.
For the frontend, I used the usual Next.js + TypeScript, but this time I used Chakra UI for the first time.
Halloween is over, but I think it&#x27;s an app that can be enjoyed even after Halloween, so I&#x27;d be happy if you could play it!
Please send me a message if you need.

                    <span>Theming a mobile app can be a tricky thing to do, and quite daunting if you&#x27;re new to the react native and javascript ecosystem. But I&#x27;ve tried to make this post clear and straightforward, so you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues (and if you do, leave them in the comments). 
Create a file and add all of your colors to it (I added it to ./src/lib/constants.ts [see a live example here])
You don&#x27;t have to stick with light and dark, you can add custom themes such as sepia or navy.
You need to create two functions to communicate with the native storage provider. This serves two purposes
It persists the theme on the local device
Allows local storage access for web, iOS and Android
You will need to this package to manage local storage in React Native.
The functions will look something like this:

Continuing our series on implementing permission checking tools in React application, in this article we take a look at the check permissions hook and how to implement it.
The hook is actually the place where the logic of obtaining current permissions can be placed, then it can expose a method for checking permissions in a way that does not require components to bother with getting active user permissions from the profile or whatever.
Let us create a folder called models and place the types for our future hook:
// ./permissions-validation/models/use-check-permissions.ts
export type UseCheckPermissions &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; UseCheckPermissionsMethods;

Los interceptors en Angular interceptan todas las peticiones http por defecto, pero hay ocasiones en donde deseamos omitir un interceptor para algunas solicitudes.
Antes de la versi√≥n 12 de Angular era muy com√∫n hacer esto de alguna de las siguientes formas:
Agregar encabezados http en la solicitud http y luego evaluar ese encabezado en el interceptor.
Crear un nuevo httpClient para esa solicitud.
Administrar sus inyecciones de HttpClient con tokens.
Utilizar httpBackend y saltarse todos los interceptors.

                    <span>A few days ago I posted about a library I made called typed and it never happened to me before that people would actually use something I made. The thing is that I made typed to be a companion library to resty which is a thin wrapper around Node&#x27;s http core module.
Resty is what I think is the best way I&#x27;d like to write RESTful APIs in Node. It borrows some of its syntax from the fetch API and it is of course type-safe. Let me show you how I&#x27;d like to write my endpoints.

Having an endpoint of about three lines of code is pretty nice to me, specially because there&#x27;s type-safety involved. Take a closer look at request.json and request.query. They both require a typed function to be passed in. If the validation fails, a 400 Bad Request error is returned with a detailed explanation of what we‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Hello Guys, I hope All of you doing well.
Sometimes we want to measure our code to check how much time it took to work, Moreover, after improving the code we&#x27;d like to check if it works more efficiently than the older version, Or for academic purpose we want to compare algorithms to check the time complexity on a chart, For that reason I Present you YubaPerf
npm i @youba/yubaperf
# OR
yarn add @youba/yubaperf

To measure your code, you need to use these functions:
perf.start(&quot;Algorithm1&quot;);
//The code you want to measure
perf.end(&quot;Algorithm1&quot;);
console.log(perf.result(&quot;Algorithm1&quot;));

The concept here is to pass one or more than function with multiple args to measure and compare between them,
You simply need:
perfom.setfuncsToCompareSync([addUpToFirst, addUpToSecond], args);
perfom.generateChart(); // the chart located on perf/index.html file

Passing Array of functions &amp; Another one for arguments .the arguments may be a simple Array like :
[1,10,1000,1000,122] Or dimensional one for Functions who has more than input like [[&#x27;yes&#x27;,19],[&#x27;yes&#x27;,1900],[&#x27;yes&#x27;,19999]]
The Chart: 

The lib is on development,the next version will have more features like: 
Comparing async functions
setfuncsToCompareSync Return an object of the result 
...

Imagine que voc√™ utilize uma API Rest de um servi√ßo qualquer, seja ele criado internamente na empresa que voc√™ trabalha, seja ele de terceiros e que esse servi√ßo ofere√ßa um endpoint para homologa√ß√£o e outro para produ√ß√£o.
Uma abordagem inicial seria trocar os valores dessa api todas as vezes que quisermos publicar nossa aplica√ß√£o em produ√ß√£o.
Uma abordagem muito mais elegante √© configurar as vari√°veis de ambiente para que voc√™ n√£o tenha que lembrar de trocar o conte√∫do de nenhuma vari√°vel.
Aqui mostro como fazer isso utilizando o recurso de configura√ß√£o de ambiente do Angular.
Projetos criados com Angular CLI possuem por padr√£o um arquivo de configura√ß√£o chamado environment.ts dispon√≠vel na pasta environments da sua aplica√ß√£o.

environment.ts:
export const environment &#x3D; {
  production: false
};

environment.prod.ts
export const environment &#x3D; {
  production: true
};

Veja um exemplo de como usar o environment.
import { environment } from &#x27;../environments/environment&#x27;;

Do you use functions / methods to implement various conditions and DOM manipulations in Angular ? If yes, trust me it will worsen your website performance. In this tutorial I will explain how pipes increase your angular website performance and what are the various benefits of using Pipe over Functions based on a case study.
Before diving straight into tutorial, let‚Äôs start with some basic questions.
The first question comes in mind- What is Pipe? A simple definition of pipe- it is a decorative function in Angular used to manipulate DOM. It takes an untransformed value as input and returns a transformed value as output.

entirely de-couple state management code from presentational code (to the point where your state management code could be re-used across frameworks)
maximize the benefits of RxJS, while minimizing the negatives
next-level testing [and potential to hand over all our state-management code to AI at some point]
In that article, we did most of the heavy lifting - developing our state-management code and fully testing out every edge case with &quot;timeline testing&quot; (allowing us to assert not only &quot;what&quot; state looks like, but &quot;when&quot; it should look that way as well).

                    <span>One of the most time-consuming and frustrating aspects of computational tasks has always been properly installing software and getting it up and running in no time. In the case of bioinformatics tools, this is notoriously difficult in some cases, particularly in Linux-based operating systems such as Ubuntu, where one-click installer files, unlike Windows, are not an option. Although much of the popular software in the bioinformatics world is easy to install in Ubuntu if one is familiar with the ecosystem, a beginner will certainly have a difficult time circling the internet trying to find a proper installation method, at least, that‚Äôs what I had to go through when I first started out.
Here in this article, I compiled out the installation methods of some of the most commonly used bioinformatics and simulation tools, as well as how to run these tools after installing them on an Ubuntu 20.04 machine. Feel free to let me know which software should be added next.

                    <span>It feels like a lot of people on here who use Linux like to talk about Linux. I am not an exception, so here&#x27;s my journey/opinions on Linux.
My first exposure to Linux was in a virtual machine and it was OpenSUSE. Which I remember very little about now, except that I thought it was quite fun. I mostly just looked at it a bit, but I liked it.
When Netbooks came out, you could get a 9 inch one with Linux on it. I don&#x27;t remember which distro was on it, but it wasn&#x27;t a common one. I don&#x27;t think it said when it was sold, I googled to find out. It was more of a useful little computer to have on your lap on the sofa for odd little bits, so the OS didn&#x27;t make a great deal of difference. But the computer not being very powerful meant Linux was better on it than Windows.

I always forget to turn off the EC2 instance when I am not using the computer. Because of this, I always end up paying tons for forgetting to turn it off. The cost of these EC2 instances are usually $1 per hour. Hence, if I forget to turn it off for a whole day, I would incur $24.
This feels like something the machine should do itself and not burden me for remembering. Hence, I have gathered information from all over the web to make this short, simple and easy to follow guide.
First, we need a script that checks if there is a user connecting through SSH and turn off the EC2 instance if there are none for a set interval of time. The following script does exactly that:

                    <span>When we use Angular&#x27;s schematics to generate components, unnecessary asynchronous code is added to the test setup hook for its test suite.
The following test setup is generated by Angular&#x27;s component generation schematic:
beforeEach(async () &#x3D;&gt; {
  await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  }).compileComponents();
});

component schematic.





Alternatively, we might be using Angular&#x27;s waitForAsync test function wrapper (formerly named async) as seen in the following code snippet:
beforeEach(waitForAsync(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  }).compileComponents();
}));

waitForAsync.





Here&#x27;s the deal: It&#x27;s only necessary to call the static TestBed.compileComponents method if we&#x27;re not using the Angular CLI to run our tests (who would do such a thing, Google? üëàüòè).
The Angular CLI compiles our application and tests before the tests are run so no asynchronous action is needed for setting up the declarables.
Let&#x27;s simplify the common test setup by leaving out async-await, waitForAsync, and even the TestBed.compileComponents invocation as seen in this code snippet:
beforeEach(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  });
});

The following points are true for common Angular testbed setup for tests covering all types of Angular declarables:
No need to use async-await
No need to use waitForAsync (formerly named async)
No need to call TestBed.compileComponents



Of course, there might be other reasons for introducing asynchronicity to our test setup but compiling and linking declarables is not one of them.

The Raspberry Pi 4 offers an excellent upgrade to the preceding Pi 3B+, but keeping the new model from overheating can be a challenge. Users have tried many techniques to tackle this issue, from running the Pi in the open air to utilizing cooling rigs with fans attached. But as vertical cases are gaining popularity, can my DIY vertical case keep the Broadcom BCM2711B0 quad-core A72 SOC (system on chip)‚Äîcool? Spoiler alert: Surprisingly, yes.
First of all, why subject your Raspberry Pi to this level of stress? In the case of Raspberry Pi 4, the A72 CPU is so powerful that it can overheat if it doesn&#x27;t have enough cooling. This results in the CPU being thermal throttled (governed) to reduce the power consumption and in turn reducing heat generation. The ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>A private bug bounty program I am on had a scope increase recently.
*target.com

amass does not seem to have a feature that handles this sort of search, so I generated that list in bash/zsh:
for i in $(cat mylist.txt); do 
    echo $itarget.com &gt;&gt; potential-targets; 
done

This is for only one target. If your list containing multiple targets is in targets.txt, do:
for i in $(cat targets.txt); do 
    for j in $(cat mylist.txt); do
        echo $j$i &gt;&gt; potential-targets.txt; 
    done
done

This can yield a big file. To compress it after creation:
gzip -9 potential-targets.txt

To zip them during creation:
for i in $(cat targets.txt); do 
    for j in $(cat mylist.txt); do
        echo $j$i | gzip -9 &gt;&gt; potential-targets.txt.gz; 
    done
done

Once you&#x27;ve created the list of targets and zipped them, lets say we want to find all of the potentials yielding actual pages with content. Fire up httpx:
zcat potential-targets.txt.gz | \
httpx -no-fallback -o httpx.txt

Because this can take a long time, you might consider lowering the timeout, or using more or less threads:
zcat potential-targets.txt.gz | \
httpx -no-fallback -o httpx.txt -threads 200 -timeout 1

Lets say you didn&#x27;t zip potential-targets. That&#x27;s ok. httpx has an option to read directly from file. Everyone online is so obsessed with piping output because they think it is cool, but encouraging people to merely copy/paste data results in bad thinking and approach.
httpx -l potential-targets.txt -no-fallback \
-o httpx.txt -threads 200 -timeout 1

This will run for a long time. I was running it with default timeout and 8 threads on 300,000+ possible names and it had not completed after several hours. I&#x27;m running it now on a much larger namespace and even though it is taking a long time, I am already yielding new names that did not show up in amass.

                    <span>The Wikipedia description of a JSON Web eToken (JWT) is:
JSON Web Token is a proposed Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption 
However, this definition says a lot without really saying a lot. When I&#x27;m trying to understand a concept, I like to play around with relevant libraries. We&#x27;ll try this out with JWTs using the popular javascript library jsonwebtoken.
The first thing the docs mention is that the sign function returns a 
secret.
const jwtLibrary &#x3D; require(&#x27;jsonwebtoken&#x27;);

// The only arguments we need are a secret value and some JSON
const json &#x3D; {&quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot;, &quot;key2&quot;: &quot;value2&quot;}
const secret &#x3D; &quot;shhhhh&quot;;

                    <span>One of the most powerful features when creating Angular components is the Async Pipe. The greatest thing about it is that it allows you to take advantage of asynchronous rendering in your template without having to worry about subscribing and unsubscribing from Observables.
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;
import { of, Subject } from &#x27;rxjs&#x27;;
import { delay, startWith, takeUntil } from &#x27;rxjs/operators&#x27;;

@Component({
  selector: &#x27;my-app&#x27;,
  template: &#x60;
    
Async example
 
    
Items
 
    
{{item}}
Other Items
 
    
{{other}}
 this.otherItems &#x3D; other)
  }
  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.destroy$.next();
    this.destroy$.complete();
  }
}


Check it out on Stackblitz.
As you can see, in the first example, we are rendering a list (items) using the async pipe in the HTML template. There is no need for the additional handling after the component is destroyed, which you can see is not the case for the other list otherItems.   That is simply because the async pipe is going to take care of that for you.</span>

1. Ivy Everywhere
In Angular 12, View Engine is deprecated, and the community is working on ongoing delivery towards the goal of amalgamating the ecosystem of Angular on Ivy. Current libraries still use View Engine. But the library authors want to shift to Ivy. AngularJS development services become easy with Ivy as developers can compile all components independently and enhances development times.
2. Adios Protractor

The team decided to remove it in further new tasks and more furnished alternatives along with third-party solutions. They are working with webdriverIO, TestCafe, and Cypress t‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>As we know multiple components share the common data and always need updated shared data. In such scenarios most of the time BehaviorSubject is used which acts as a single store to hold updated shared data.
BehaviorSubject is both observer and type of observable.
BehaviorSubject always need an initial/default value.
Every observer on subscribe gets current value.
Current value is either latest value emitted by source observable using next() method or initial/default value.
Let‚Äôs implement BehaviorSubject to understand a concept better!
For e.g In order tracking app, display total items in cart and total items in wish list on UI in header and dashboard section based on user action.
Now we have three components -

Run Live
When user add items in the cart/wishList, total count needs to be updated in the header and dashboard component.
1.First create a BehaviorSubject in order service which holds the initial state of order count ,so that it can be used by any component.




3.When a user performs any action, call the next() method of BehaviorSubject. When the next() method gets called it will update current count with new count and notifies updated count to all observers(3 Components) who subscribed to source observable.

This way BehaviorSubject makes components communication more effective.
