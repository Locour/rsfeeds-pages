Es una aplicaci√≥n que no depende de un sistema central, sino que depende de la comunidad de usuarios que la utilizan, una DAPP puede ser una app m√≥vil o una aplicaci√≥n web que interact√∫a con un contrato inteligente, el cual ejecuta todas las funciones.

I can&#x27;t really remember what I was googling when I saw an advert by flexiple .So I sign up and the company recruiter schedule a call with me the following week.
After this process, flexiple prepared my CV by trying to  organize it to suite potential client i would work with in the future. Which was pretty straight forward and fast.
The final stage was divided into two stages
So I had to start preparing for this interview with leetcode and Hacker Ranker. I  started practicing algorithm, learnt recursion, binary search, Hash tree etc. 
To prepare further someone shared a picture of some AlogExpert algorithms  questions and  how it helped him land is current  job .I took a screen shot and started solving this algorithms one after the other .Note  I didn&#x27;t solve all

To cut the long story short I did the code challenge and I am officially a freelance developer at flexiple looking forward to the journey ahead.</span>

Can we generate a PDF from that?
Let&#x27;s see how I did it.
First, you&#x27;ll need some help, so run the following commands:
npm i --save dom-to-image
npm i --save jspdf

Once we have this two packages, we can use them in our code 
import { jsPDF } from &#x27;jspdf&#x27;;
import domtoimage from &#x27;dom-to-image&#x27;;

Add an ID to the HTML element you want to print:

    
 {
         const doc &#x3D; new jsPDF(dashboardWidth &gt; dashboardHeight ? &#x27;l&#x27; : &#x27;p&#x27;, &#x27;mm&#x27;, [dashboardWidth, dashboardHeight]);
         const imgProps &#x3D; doc.getImageProperties(imgData);
         const pdfWidth &#x3D; doc.internal.pageSize.getWidth();
         const pdfHeight &#x3D; (imgProps.height * pdfWidth) / imgProps.width;

         doc.addImage(imgData, &#x27;PNG&#x27;, 0, 0, pdfWidth, pdfHeight);
         doc.save(&#x27;Dashboard for hyperpanels.pdf&#x27;);
    });
}

This will create a PDF that will be saved from your browser:

And voil√°, your HTML turned into a PDF:

                    <span>PrimeNG¬†is a design-agnostic UI component library for Angular thanks to its flexible¬†theming system. Today we‚Äôre excited to announce the new free Tailwind theme to join the already impressive lineup featuring Material, Bootstrap, FluentUI and PrimeOnes themes.
The new theme uses the official color palette from Tailwind and based on the design bits at Tailwind UI such as forms, modals and menus. If you are utilizing tailwind ui and looking for a fully featured UI component library, PrimeFaces with the Tailwind theme will be an excellent choice. Note that, the theme does not use tailwind classes and instead provides a look-alike style for a unified design when used together.

Image is a new addition to the UI suite to display an image with transformation options like rotate and zoom. For multiple images, please see the Galleria.

There are over 30 improvements in this release, defect fixes are mostly based on community feedback so thank you for helping us to make the library better.
PrimeNG is licensed under MIT and free to download at NPM.
Our current focus is on improving accessibility by creating a dedicated section per component for keyboard support and screen readers along with scores from audit tools.</span>

                    <span>Environment variables in an Angular app are extremely useful for storing constants in your app that need to be used frequently, such as API url&#x27;s, API access keys, Firebase config values and other general flags.
When a new Angular app is created via the CLI tooling using ng new, one of the folders generated is &#x27;environments&#x27;.
By default, this folder contains two files:
- environment.ts
- environment.prod.ts
These files come prepopulated with the following code:
environment.ts:
export const environment &#x3D; {
  production: false,
};

environment.prod.ts:
export const environment &#x3D; {
  production: true,
};

The simple explanation of the usage of these files is that any values added into an environment file are injected into the compiled files when the Angular app is built.

                    <span>I do not like to subscribe to observables inside services, as it feels expensive due to the fact that we are not able to unsubscribe from them when we do not need them any more and we all hate memory leaks, right?
So the best way to use this solution will be the way that we would be able to unsubscribe from them when we done listening to that observable.
First, we should not create that service as Singleton service, instead we should make sure the service will be specifically responsible only to handle some functionalities which is related to small part of our app at presentation layer or better to say, it will only take care of logics which related to the Dump component. It does not mean it should not be there for make container/smart components more simple, but in this example I was tryi‚Ä¶</span>

1.Enhanced feature ownership
Full-stack developers tend to implement features from beginning to end. They usually develop better concepts for applying and testing those features, given that they are 100% accountable for the production outcomes.
They are aware of the process of interaction of the components of the system and see the majority of the areas which have been impacted in the project that can break and require modifications. 
If something is not working, it will be their code, and they will be capable of debugging it without disturbing other folks. The product‚Äôs quality increases a lot thanks to this type of focus and commitment, and the number of glitches is minimized.

By the time I left in 2016, the engineering organization had grown to 120, and the team that managed AWS to 25. We had one of the strongest engineering teams on the planet, but more than a fifth of it was focused on undifferentiated AWS heavy lifting that our customers didn‚Äôt know or care about.
Assuming a typical Bay Area cost-to-company of $200K per engineer, managing AWS likely cost Stripe at least $5 million in 2016. This was in addition to their AWS bill, equity compensation, and the often ignored organizational overhead that increases with every new hire.

In recent times, the containerization of Apps has become an excellent means to help solve most of the mentioned challenges. Many solutions containerize and help manage and operationalize the application, but the most used of all the available solutions is Kubernetes.
Kubernetes is a container management tool that automates the deployment, scaling, and operations of an application.

If you have experienced significant replication lags and replication so slow that it needed hours to complete or couldn&#x27;t catch up at all, I may have a solution for you.
A couple of weeks ago, I set up a MariaDB replication from scratch for a production database. The database has a considerable size and is under heavy use.
As usual, I used Mariabackup to copy the entire data directory of MariaDB to the new replica server. Unfortunately, I had to interrupt my work and wasn&#x27;t able to continue until 12 hours later. As I resumed where I left off, I noticed that the database grew substantially. Since I didn&#x27;t want to resync about 200 GB of data, I left the rest to the replication.
Well, It did not go as planned. The replication was so slow that it couldn&#x27;t catch up.

Our dockerized application might have to communicate with file system either for reading or writing data, based on the functionality. Some data needs to be persisted and some data are not. 
By default all files created inside a container are stored on a writable container layer. This means that:
1)The data doesn‚Äôt persist when that container no longer exists, and it can be difficult to get the data out of the container if another process needs it.
2)A container‚Äôs writable layer is tightly coupled to the host machine where the container is running. You can‚Äôt easily move the data somewh‚Ä¶</span>

When running a Developer Relations program, it&#x27;s typically not dollars or leads that directly define your success, but whether you&#x27;re enabling developers to get their job done. Measuring that can be a tricky task, but at Orbit&#x27;s Community Camp virtual event, four experienced DevRel leaders shared their advice on measuring success in Developer Relations:
Joe Nash, Staff Developer Educator at Twilio
Mary Thengvall, Director of Developer Relations at Camunda
Matthew Revell, Developer Relations Consultant and founder of DevRelCon
Jeremy Meiss, Director of DevRel and Community at CircleCI

                    <span>The first time you probably hear about your child‚Äôs IQ is when there is some question about their abilities in school, whether it‚Äôs above or below expectations. This often misunderstood concept is foreign to most people, perhaps with the exception of those quick tests that they offer online. You know the ones to which I refer. But, IQ in relation to what it means for assessment, academics, and even expectations, merits serious attention.
IQ, short for intelligence quotient, is a measure of a person‚Äôs reasoning ability. In short, it is supposed to gauge how well someone can use information and logic to answer questions or make predictions. Real IQ tests begin to assess this by measuring short- and long-term memory.
One should know his/her IQ score and use it to evaluate one‚Äôs self, but indiscriminately, objectivity should be maintained. For some people, knowing their IQ helps boost their self confidence and morale, and eggs them on to attempt new things, fight challenges or to tax their mental resources and stretch the arch to scale greater heights. For others, it may have adverse effects. Learning that one‚Äôs IQ is below average, can be a shattering experience. They may withdraw into themselves and tag themselves complete losers who would never taste any fruit of success.
Intelligence quotients are definitely useful and can be instrumental in clinical practice and education, but it is important to remember what such tests are and aren‚Äôt good for. An IQ score tells a story but not always the whole story. It can be critical for helping someone on the road to success but not crippling. And it can be informative to know and sometimes unnecessary.

These providers can leverage the REST infrastructure to easily connect to the back-end of shopping platforms and extract data related to products, orders, and inventory.
In the eCommerce sphere, the API (Application Programming Interface) is used to tie two systems, allowing for easy data transfer. The REST API uses the HTTPS protocol to enable eCommerce software developers to work with data using GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE commands.

                    <span>Linux sometimes seems to be very difficult from the outside but once you get a head start there are a ton of possibilities with linux which are not available with windows. Obviously you may not get as attractive and beginner friendly interface as windows does but everything comes with a price doesn&#x27;t it.
Here I will list 10 commands and explain them which you could try out yourself on your linux OS right away and experience it yourselves. 
df

this command will show the amount of available disk space and used disk space for file system to which you as a user currently has access to. For eg : if you have a dual boot system established in your pc and your linux OS doesn&#x27;t have access to the D folder.If you run this command on your linux terminal then you wont be able to see the partiton of used and unused space of D folder. this command is same as when you open the disk management tool in windows.



top

This command when you type in your terminal it will show the active linux processes which are managed by your linux kernel. This command is used like how you would use task manager in windows, the difference being , it shows the details of all the processes in far more depth than windows does.
it will look something like this when you type the command.


this is what is meant by each column head.

you can press &#x27;q&#x27; to exit this window in your termial.

I&#x27;m someone who is now using Linux as my main OS but remember quite well how difficult it was to get my head around the workings of Linux my first few weeks.
So today i&#x27;m going to share a number of helpful commands to get you on your way!
Does exactly what it says on the tin.... it helps you change your directory in the company line. So for example, if you want to go into your download directory you can do the following;
cd /home/username/Downloads/

You can also  use  the shorthand  version;
cd ~/Downloads

The important bit of the second command is the ~ and the /
The tilde (~) is the Linux shortcut for the home directory whereas ~/ references the start of a directory in the logged in users folder.

The tl;dr is:
# read the YubiKey
echo &quot;Press your YubiKey&quot;
read -rs YUBIKEY

A YubiKey is a device made by Yubico intended as a form of MFA.
Generally, it&#x27;s a USB device that is used to obtain access to sensitive resources.
Yubico provides a cli, ykman, for the YubiKey. The intention of ykman is to allow IT administrators to configure YubiKeys for their organizations. 
I thought that it would be cool to have some shell scripts around for common APIs within my organization, but some of these require a credential generated from my YubiKey. My logic was that perhaps ykman could script the YubiKey credential generation for me.
I googled for an hour and only came up with a couple discussions about this. Unfortunately, one of them held some bad news:
I don&#x27;t think there is a way to programmatically get a YubiOTP from the YubiKey
from discussion on ykman issue 400
The solution is a quick-and-dirty &quot;silent read&quot; from the terminal:
# read the YubiKey
echo &quot;Press your YubiKey&quot;
read -rs YUBIKEY
echo &quot;Thank you&quot;

I thought I&#x27;d post that in case someone else goes searching for it in the future.</span>

Almost every novice user knows how it feels to lose data after reinstalling the operating system. You may have forgotten to copy important information from the system disk before you start the reinstallation process, and now all that data is gone. Everyone knows that bitter feeling of trying to find important data and discovering is doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. Fortunately, there are many solutions nowadays that can help you get your data back. One of them is Hetman Partition Recovery, a well-tried and reliable utility globally recognized for successful data ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>This blog focuses on installing Nvidia driver and few other drivers using the mokutil signing functionality.
openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /home/user/Nvidia.key -outform DER -out /home/user/Nvidia.der -nodes -days 36500 -subj &quot;/CN&#x3D;Graphics Drivers&quot;

First command will ask for a password. After reboot enter the same password. (** Prompt will ask for characters in specific position of the password. Do not enter the whole password. **)
sudo mokutil --import /home/user/Nvidia.der
sudo reboot

Check if keys are enrolled
sudo mokutil --list-enrolled # or sudo mokutil --list-enrolled | grep -i Graphics

Updated the /etc/dkms/sign_helper.sh. Add/update the line with the newly created key paths.
/lib/modules/&quot;$1&quot;/build/scripts/sign-file sha512 /home/user/Nvidia.priv /home/user/Nvidia.der &quot;$2&quot;
Update /etc/dkms/framework.conf Uncomment the line where sign_tool is mentioned
sign_tool&#x3D;&quot;/etc/dkms/sign_helper.sh&quot;
If you have already added dkms modules before changing the sign file, first remove and then add them again.
sudo dkms status # Check status of dkms module
sudo dkms remove / -k 
Eg. sudo dkms remove hid-asus-rog/1.0.2 -k 5.10.0-8-amd64
sudo dkms status # Check uninstalled again
sudo dkms add . # in the cloned directory of dkms module
sudo dkms build /
sudo dkms install /

For installing Nvidia driver using the .run file and enrolled keys. Get-the-Driver-here
sudo sh ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-460.73.01.run -s --module-signing-secret-key&#x3D;/home/user/Nvidia.key --module-signing-public-key&#x3D;/home/user/Nvidia.der

If this does not work try removing -s from the command above.</span>

The series focuses on installing Debian as a primary OS and removing Windows/ formatting Windows.
Part - 1 focuses on creating a recovery drive and a bootable drive.
Wired Internet connection (Wired is preferred as the wireless drivers have to be added as part of installation)
One USB flash drive (atleast 16 GB in size) if you want to create a Windows 10 recovery drive
One USB flash drive for creating a bootable media to load the Debian OS.
Of course a laptop.
The recovery drive will store Windows OS with the system files which will allow you to reinstall Windows again at a later point in time. Consider the recovery drive as a factory reset/Wipe data option in a mobile phone nowadays.
Any personal files or applications will not be backed up in the recovery drive. For that, y‚Ä¶</span>

/api in root source code.





mkdir api

/api is endpoint folder where to run your API in server Vercel. Make sure all files API are in there.
Example: I need api to say hello in URL : /api

Javascript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language with first-class functions.
In addition, the Javascript ecosystem relies heavily on third-party libraries;

The tl;dr is:
# read the YubiKey
echo &quot;Press your YubiKey&quot;
read -rs YUBIKEY

A YubiKey is a device made by Yubico intended as a form of MFA.
Generally, it&#x27;s a USB device that is used to obtain access to sensitive resources.
Yubico provides a cli, ykman, for the YubiKey. The intention of ykman is to allow IT administrators to configure YubiKeys for their organizations. 
I thought that it would be cool to have some shell scripts around for common APIs within my organization, but some of these require a credential generated from my YubiKey. My logic was that perhaps ykman could script the YubiKey credential generation for me.
I googled for an hour and only came up with a couple discussions about this. Unfortunately, one of them held some bad news:
I don&#x27;t think there is a way to programmatically get a YubiOTP from the YubiKey
from discussion on ykman issue 400
The solution is a quick-and-dirty &quot;silent read&quot; from the terminal:
# read the YubiKey
echo &quot;Press your YubiKey&quot;
read -rs YUBIKEY
echo &quot;Thank you&quot;

I thought I&#x27;d post that in case someone else goes searching for it in the future.</span>

We talk about how technology can be weaponized for harm and that it‚Äôs not a matter of might. It‚Äôs when.

Linux has had support for Full Disk Encryption and technologies such as UEFI Secure Boot and TPMs for a long time. They are usually set up suboptimally in distributions.
Supported:
[x] Full Disk Encryption
[x] UEFI SecureBoot
[x] TPMs
We can separate the mechanisms and tools that we have to perform confidentiality and integrity operations in our systems in two large categories; disk encryption and data authentication. 
Before we dive into the direction of listing the technologies and tools that are available for each aformentioned category, it would be useful to explain the two concepts.

A huge chunk of cryptographic problems in Transport Layer Security have been uncovered and fixed, but low HTTPS adoption posed an even greater threat: recently in 2015, 55‚Äì70 percent of browser page loads were still using unencrypted HTTP.

WHAT IS API ?


API stands for Application-Programming-Interface. It is the middle layer between User Interface and Backend Server. You can take API as an waiter in restaurant, where User requests are customers and Server is the Chef in the Kitchen. When customer has a specific request, it is taken to chef by waiter. In same way, When user makes a specific request, it is requested to the server through API.

Frankly speaking, I have nothing to hide as a person; but since I&#x27;m a liberal person, I take those things very seriously.

Can we generate a PDF from that?
Let&#x27;s see how I did it.
First, you&#x27;ll need some help, so run the following commands:
npm i --save dom-to-image
npm i --save jspdf

Once we have this two packages, we can use them in our code 
import { jsPDF } from &#x27;jspdf&#x27;;
import domtoimage from &#x27;dom-to-image&#x27;;

Add an ID to the HTML element you want to print:

    
 {
         const doc &#x3D; new jsPDF(dashboardWidth &gt; dashboardHeight ? &#x27;l&#x27; : &#x27;p&#x27;, &#x27;mm&#x27;, [dashboardWidth, dashboardHeight]);
         const imgProps &#x3D; doc.getImageProperties(imgData);
         const pdfWidth &#x3D; doc.internal.pageSize.getWidth();
         const pdfHeight &#x3D; (imgProps.height * pdfWidth) / imgProps.width;

         doc.addImage(imgData, &#x27;PNG&#x27;, 0, 0, pdfWidth, pdfHeight);
         doc.save(&#x27;Dashboard for hyperpanels.pdf&#x27;);
    });
}

This will create a PDF that will be saved from your browser:

And voil√°, your HTML turned into a PDF:

                    <span>Nested if-else statements can make it unnecessarily complicated to reason about the different executions paths and results of a function. A loss of productivity and the introduction of bugs due to misunderstandings can be the outcome.
The refactoring &quot;Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses&quot; from Martin Fowler&#x27;s book &quot;Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code (2nd Edition)&quot; can help in those situations.
A guard clause checks for a condition and returns from the function if the condition is true, potentially doing some computation and returning a result. It makes it easier to reason about the function by ending one execution path early. 
Here is an example function (from Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses, Martin Fowler) before refactoring:

                    <span>Environment variables in an Angular app are extremely useful for storing constants in your app that need to be used frequently, such as API url&#x27;s, API access keys, Firebase config values and other general flags.
When a new Angular app is created via the CLI tooling using ng new, one of the folders generated is &#x27;environments&#x27;.
By default, this folder contains two files:
- environment.ts
- environment.prod.ts
These files come prepopulated with the following code:
environment.ts:
export const environment &#x3D; {
  production: false,
};

environment.prod.ts:
export const environment &#x3D; {
  production: true,
};

The simple explanation of the usage of these files is that any values added into an environment file are injected into the compiled files when the Angular app is built.

                    <span>I do not like to subscribe to observables inside services, as it feels expensive due to the fact that we are not able to unsubscribe from them when we do not need them any more and we all hate memory leaks, right?
So the best way to use this solution will be the way that we would be able to unsubscribe from them when we done listening to that observable.
First, we should not create that service as Singleton service, instead we should make sure the service will be specifically responsible only to handle some functionalities which is related to small part of our app at presentation layer or better to say, it will only take care of logics which related to the Dump component. It does not mean it should not be there for make container/smart components more simple, but in this example I was tryi‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Asynchronous interactions are the bread-and-butter of modern JavaScript programming. Let‚Äôs see how we can abstract away all the heavy lifting and boilerplate of data fetching in a custom useTypedFetch hook ü™ù.
‚ú® This article is particularly aimed at beginners and those who want to familiarize themselves with async TypeScript a little better and maybe start using it with React. 
Since it might be tricky to work with dynamic types of data in TypeScript (and almost all api calls, per se, are purely dynamic), we want to build a flexible tool that will adapt to any kind of an api response and will do this dynamically. 
Additionally, it would be great to make this hook &quot;http-client-agnostic&quot;. Put simply, this hook should get a standardized input (url, method, headers etc) and should seamlessly w‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>I have developed a free open source chrome extension named context-note, aiming to provide a better way to take, search and review notes on the web.

It could be cumbersome and time-consuming: at least four operations (c&amp;p the text, c&amp;p the website link, write the note, c&amp;p the image) need to be done to finish this single note.
Loss of context details: when reviewing this note, you can only read the sentence and image instead of the whole page, useless you open the link and scroll to the exact place where you have token this note.
By the way, another more easy method is simply clicking star ‚≠ê of the browser to throw the website link into the bookmark. As you can imagine, without the content and note information, you basically can not remember why you marked down this link someday after two months.
So I think a more efficient tool should be used during taking notes on the web, especially when you are reading articles or learning something new. That is why I built context-note.
https://youtu.be/ZcakhGp_-HQ
It is a chrome extension with three key fetarues:
Notebook, where text content, note itself and context information would be stored.
Tagbook, manage the notes neatly with a handy tag system.
Rich text editor: embed quill as the rich text editor.
Taking notes with their context, I believe it would be a better way to store and review things that really matter to us.</span>

                    <span>JavaScript is an awesome programming language. And TypeScript has done a great job at filling in the gaps of JavaScript. Not only does it add types, it also implements a few extra features which aren&#x27;t there in JavaScript yet. One of them are decorators.
Decorators have been there in programming languages for a long time. Definitions vary, but in short a decorator is a pattern in JavaScript which is used to wrap something to change it&#x27;s behavior.
In both JavaScript and TypeScript this is an experimental feature. In JavaScript, it&#x27;s still a Stage 2 proposal and you can only use it via transpilers like Babel.
I&#x27;ve decided to explain TypeScript decorators because in TypeScript it has been standardized, and both are basically the same anyways.

                    <span>Displaying the app version automatically pulled from package.json is a great way to ask clients and users to verify what version they are using.  It is also helpful to include it in error logging.  In previous versions of Angular it was as easy as doing this inside your environment.ts files:
import { version } from &#x27;../../package.json&#x27;;

However in Angular 12 you get an error:
Error: Should not import the named export &#x27;version&#x27; (imported as &#x27;version&#x27;) from default-exporting module (only default export is available soon)
export const environment &#x3D; {
  ...
  VERSION: require(&#x27;../../package.json&#x27;).version,
};

And there is a good chance you will need to add this to your tsconfig.app.json:

Hi All
I am an avid user of ZEN for over 10 years now and it works for me.

But it seems that Intersystems are no longer actively developing it (or ZEN Mojo), the only published reference to this¬† is¬†here
As an aside, Intersystems makes fine products (I have been using the technology for 35 years) and has great support BUT they are not good at being open with their product road map/retirement plans.¬† This is very embarrassing¬† to me when talking with my end user clients.


So I am looking at how to replace ZEN - this is not a short term project, at one client I have over 800 ZEN pages.

And it&#x27;s such a shame as ZEN works and, most importantly, I and the team know how to make it &quot;sing and dance&quot;.

                    <span>Have you ever wanted to use React components in an Angular application ? Or to start migrating an Angular app to React component-by-component ? Or simply use both at the same time ?
I developped ngx-react which allows you to do just that with ease.
It enables you to use your Angular components in React, and vice versa, quite transparently, and without boilerplate.
Just declare a bridge, somewhere in your application:
import { NgxReactBridge } from &#x27;ngx-react&#x27;;

export const bridge &#x3D; new NgxReactBridge()
    // bridge options:
    .addProvider(/** Add a global react provider here */);

Then, to use an Angular component in React, just import it like that:
const AsReact &#x3D; bridge.toReact(MyAngularCommonent);

// use it üëâ  

The generated ‚öõÔ∏è component will take as props all the @Input()s of your üÖ∞Ô∏è component, and all the @Output()s, mapped to functions. (i.e. @Output() onThing: EventEmitter will be mapped to prop onThing: (event: string) &#x3D;&gt; void.
To use a React component in Angular, you&#x27;ll have to do a tiny bit more work... for instance if you have a React component:
function MyReactComponent(props: {
  data: string;
  dataChange: (evt: string) &#x3D;&gt; void;
}) {
    // [...]
}


Then magically convert it to its Angular counterpart like that:
@Directive({ selector: &quot;my-react-component&quot; })
export class MyReactComponent_Angular extends reactBridge.toAngular(
  MyReactComponent
) {

  // a bit of extra work: You will have to map the properties yourself 
  @Input()
  data!: string;
  @Output()
  dataChange &#x3D; new EventEmitter();
}

(the Angular compiler doesnt allow to build dynamic components... so we have to declare them statically)
Just inject Angular services in React like that:
const service &#x3D; useService(MyAngularService);

I&#x27;ll write more about this when I have more time üëâ But please share your thought if you have some :)

This article explains how to manage subscriptions in Angular components without repeating the same teardown logic in each component.
There are two common ways to manage RxJS subscriptions in Angular components to prevent memory leaks:
@Component({
  selector: &#x27;interval&#x27;,
  templateUrl: &#x27;./interval.component.html&#x27;,
})
export class IntervalComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  // initialize &#x60;Subscription&#x60; object
  private readonly subscriptions &#x3D; new Subscription();

  ngOnInit(): void {
    // add all subscriptions to it
    this.subscriptions.add(
      interval(1000)
        .pipe(map(i &#x3D;&gt; &#x60;&#x3D;&#x3D; ${i} &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x60;))
        .subscribe(console.log)
    );

    this.subscriptions.add(
      interval(2000)
        .pipe(map(i &#x3D;&gt; &#x60;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; ${i} &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x60;))

                    <span>What Is OpenGL?


OpenGL is a Graphics rendering API which is operating system independent, window system independent and has high-quality color images composed of geometric and image primitives. OpenGL APIs can use following - 
GL


OpenGL API implementation (http://www.opengl.org)
GLU


OpenGL Utility
Glut


GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) ‚Äì Glut is portable windowing API and it is not officially part of OpenGL.
OpenGL Utility Toolkit (http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/)
FLTK


FlashLight ToolKit (http://www.fltk.org/)
GLEW
Now lets see how to install OpenGL in Ubuntu.
Now because GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) depends upon OpenGL and a number of other related libraries, if we install GLUT then OpenGL will be automatically be installed.
First update the repository using the given command
$ sudo apt-get update

Run the following command to install OpenGL.
$ sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev

Now to test if OpenGL libraries are working fine on our Linux machine, we will create a C++ program and test it.
So create a following C++ Program.
#include 

void displayMe(void)
{
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
    glBegin(GL_POLYGON);
        glVertex3f(0.5, 0.0, 0.5);
        glVertex3f(0.5, 0.0, 0.0);
        glVertex3f(0.0, 0.5, 0.0);
        glVertex3f(0.0, 0.0, 0.5);
    glEnd();
    glFlush();
}

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    glutInit(&amp;argc, argv);
    glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_SINGLE);
    glutInitWindowSize(400, 300);
    glutInitWindowPosition(100, 100);
    glutCreateWindow(&quot;Hello world!&quot;);
    glutDisplayFunc(displayMe);
    glutMainLoop();
    return 0;
}

Now give the command below to compile your code.
$ g++ main.cpp -o firstOpenGlApp -lglut -lGLU -lGL

Now run your OpenGl program with following command
$ ./firstOpenGlApp

You will see something like this on your screen if everythings went well.</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve asked in various places including Stackoverflow and at work this question but not getting anything back: how to get a list of all project deployments regardless of retention period (specifically using Octopus Deploy REST API)?
What I&#x27;m currently getting: a list of all project deployments as per retention period set.
I believe (might be wrong) it&#x27;s retention period is set per environment as, for example, for project X I&#x27;m getting 2 Live deployments back and in the same project all (by default) of Branch Tests.
I&#x27;m wanting to get a list of all project deployments but, to me at least, seems odd I can&#x27;t get just a list regardless of retention period.
This gets me a list of all deployments but still only get 2 for Live for instance.
HTTP GET: https:///api/deployments
Does anyone have idea how to get around this? Or have I missed something? There is documentation online in general but not enough tbh and not this specific.</span>

NodeJS allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser.
Node.js is a free, open source, server environment that uses JavaScript language to create server-side web applications. (backend)
Node.js works on different platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.) With Node.js we can build a fast and highly scalable web application.

                    <span>Hello Reader üëã
To update an object inside a nested array in MongoDB you can use this approach, Its well tested and working.
Update nested array objects. See below picture for a better Idea what we are going to do. We will update the object which is nested by 3 levels of array.
{
 discussionList[
  discussionList [
   {
     object-value-to-be-updated.
   }
  ]
 ]
} 


public courseCategoryPostCommentReplyUpdate(operation: CommentReplyUpdateMutation): Promise {
    return this.courseCategoryPostCommentsModel.updateOne(
      {
        &quot;postId&quot; : operation.postId,
        &#x27;discussionList&#x27;: {
          &#x27;$elemMatch&#x27;: {
            &#x27;_id&#x27;: operation.commentId,
            &quot;discussionList._id&quot;: operation.replyId
          }
        }
      },
      {
        $set: {
          &quot;discussionList.$[outer].discussionList.$[inner].payload&quot;: operation.payload,
          &quot;discussionList.$[outer].discussionList.$[inner].isUpdated&quot;: true,
          &quot;discussionList.$[outer].discussionList.$[inner].commentUpdateTime&quot;: new Date()
        }
      },
      {
        arrayFilters: [
          { &quot;outer._id&quot;: operation.commentId},
          {&quot;inner._id&quot;: operation.replyId}

      ]
      }
    );
  }

FootNotes - this code is to update the reply of a comment.
That&#x27;s how you can perform operations on an object in nested array in mongoDB document. You can also update/delete the objects which are having the more level of nesting by just modifying the query.
Please let me know if the code needs an explanation. Thanks üôÇ</span>
