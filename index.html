                    <span>If we use OnPush change detection strategy, immutability is helpful to ensure change detection works expectedly. 
One of the way to enforce immutability is using Immutable.js. However, using Immutable.js is not really straightforward. It adds another layer instead of using JS object directly e.g
const apps &#x3D; List([{ name: &#x27;slack&#x27; }, { name: &#x27;skype&#x27; }]);
apps.get(0); // { name: &#x27;slack&#x27; }

const app &#x3D; Map({ name: &#x27;slack&#x27; });
map.get(&quot;name&quot;); // &#x27;slack&#x27;

// Using Record if we want to access property directly
const AppRecord &#x3D; Record({
    name: &#x27;&#x27;
});

class App extends AppRecord {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }
}

const newApp &#x3D; new App({ name: &#x27;slack&#x27; });
newApp.name; // &#x27;slack&#x27;

We have to use get when using List and Map. Using Record could solve the issue, but if we have a very large object, using Record will be hard to maintain because we need to create each record per object and it&#x27;s nested object.
Other issue is about JS compatibility because it needs to use fromJS and toJS methods to convert from and to JS object. 
I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;m not a fan of that lib and it makes things more complicated. 
Other possible approach I&#x27;m thinking of: 
readonly + ESLint immutable


Since Angular using Typescript, let&#x27;s use Readonly, ReadonlyArray to enforce immutability. 
Also add this no-mutation ESLint rule as extra protection https://github.com/jonaskello/eslint-plugin-functional/blob/master/docs/rules/immutable-data.md
is there any better approach?

Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
Supabase is an authentication service with simple tools to help developers build applications.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the account. Access the site https://supabase.io/ and click on the button Start your project.

2. Click on the button Continue with GitHub.

3. Fill in the fields Username or email address, Password and click on the button Sign in to login with your GitHub account and if you don&#x27;t have an account, click on the button Create an accou‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Render.com is a new Platform-as-a-service offering that&#x27;s a great alternative to Heroku. Rather than think in terms of &quot;apps&quot; as Heroku does; Render has the concept of &quot;services&quot;. So your Rails app would be a service; your database would be another service; Redis would be another service etc. Services could also potentially be shared between multiple apps.  
Any non-trivial Rails app these days needs Background Jobs and a popular framework for this is Sidekiq. Sidekiq uses Redis as a data store. This means we need to deploy 4 services to Render to run our app:  
Rails web service
Sidekiq background service
PostgreSQL database
Redis
Render supports &quot;infrastructure as code&quot; so we&#x27;re going to define these services in a YAML file so it&#x27;s tracked in git along with our application code. Ruby env‚Ä¶</span>

When you have a Kubernetes cluster in AWS (EKS), you will need to have a lot of space for each node&#x27;s disk. 
PLEG is not healthy errors.
Following advices of the AWS support, (in my case) I need to set this value to 150Go to let some space for all your pods/images/deployments...
The weird thing is that I haven&#x27;t seen any documentation which explain how much we need to define for each kind of EC2 instance.
If you have this link, please send it to me.
Also you can monitor some values in Cloudwatch (if you have a cloudwatch agent on your cluster) to check if everything is alright, and set up some alerts to be aware if something wrong is happening.

1.Kubernetes: It is founded by Google and is a container orchestration platform. Large-scale containers are dealt with the open-source system and thus tries to take the containerization process to the next level. 
Containerized apps are segregated into logical units for the purpose of scaling, simple discovery and management and automating deployment.
2.Git: It is considered to be one of the most widely used DevOps tools. Rem‚Ä¶</span>

This chapter provides an overview of the proposed infrastructure, and explains the different components used, along with the advantages it provides.

Virtual Private cluster (VPC): is a private network, within the public cloud, that is logically isolated (hidden) from other virtual networks. Each VPC may contain one or more subnets (Logical divisions of the VPC) attached to it.

                    <span>One problem that many managers, engineering leadership, and even engineers themselves have are figuring out how to measure engineering value. It&#x27;s not like in sales where there are numbers and KPI&#x27;s to give you an idea about if you&#x27;re on track or not. With a CICD pipeline, there is no measurement of value. You can&#x27;t measure how many times it passed or failed because those numbers have nothing to do with providing value.
The best way that everyone on an engineering team, including management/leadership, can see the value gained is by using Value Stream Management (VSM).
In this blog post, you&#x27;ll learn what VSM is, why it&#x27;s important, and a few tools to take a look at.

                    <span>Hi everyone!
This is a tale of an adventurous fresher on her first day at work. This is also an article on K8s, so bear with me.
An application program (app or application for short) is a computer program designed to carry out a specific task typically to be used by end users.
Containers are a form of virtualization of operating systems. They are software executable units in which application code, together with its dependencies and configurations, is packed in such a manner that it may be run on any environment.
Think of containers like the work machines/laptops that can enable employees to be independent and deliver services effectively. They are portable, enable the employee to work from home or office, and have all the resources the employee needs to complete the tasks. They are also isolated, so the employee is not influenced by what others run on their machines.
To understand how Kubernetes works, we must familiarise ourselves with images.
Images can be related to the guide or manual which one uses for getting the work machine started. Or, think of it as the blueprint for creating a work machine in the first place :).
In the coming parts, we will explore how to get started with docker images and containers.

                    <span>Historically, in monolithic architectures, logs were stored directly on bare metal or virtual machines. They never left the machine disk and the operations team would check each one for logs as needed.
This worked on long-lived machines, but machines in the cloud are ephemeral. As more companies run their services on containers and orchestrate deployments with Kubernetes, logs can no longer be stored on machines and implementing a log management strategy is of the utmost importance.
Logs are an effective way of debugging and monitoring your applications, and they need to be stored on a separate backend where they can be queried and analyzed in case of pod or node failures. These separate backends include systems like Elasticsearch, GCP‚Äôs Stackdriver, and AWS‚Äô Cloudwatch.

                    <span>While working with the Jenkins jobs (whether it‚Äôs declarative or freestyle), we often need to pass some parameters to the code being executed when you trigger the job. Jenkins supports this use-case by means of parameters that you can declare and use as Groovy variables in your Jenkins job. However, often you are not aware of all the parameters in the beginning or sometimes you want to render the parameters dynamically based on the value selected in any other parameter. Given the declarative nature of Jenkins jobs, we cannot achieve the use-case with the native Jenkins parameters available. Here comes the Active Choices parameter plugin to the rescue, which can help us render parameters/parameter‚Äôs value dynamically.

Personally I don&#x27;t like them for maintenance reasons (how do you remove things you installed like this?), and I want to nag my fellows to not casually run a wall-of-script fro the Internet.
When a bash shell is started at login it&#x27;s considered interactive and expects to be attached to a TTY. When we run curl https://example.com/script.sh | bash the bash process started is non-interactive and expects no human input. We can confirm a bash process&#x27; interactivity either by looking at the process table (run ps) or by checking the builtin variable $- (the shell&#x27;s starting arguments) for an &#x27;i&#x27; character.

                    <span>Theoretically, Azure Data Studio is all you need to manage Azure SQL databases on Linux, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work that way. I frequently end up with &quot;login failed for token-identified-principal&quot; after being connected for only a few minutes. This makes using Azure Data Studio an exercise in frustration, wondering what combination of operations will result in ADS just conking out on you until your token expires.
Azure SQL doesn&#x27;t support the standard T-SQL BACKUP and RESTORE commands, so getting a copy of your database for local development is somewhat challenging. The Azure Portal requires the AAD admin credentials, not something I want to give out to developers. Enter SqlPackage, which I have started preferring to both the Azure portal and ADS. SqlPackage for Linux is available at https://aka.ms/sqlpackage-linux.
A first attempt at copying the database from Azure might look like this:
sqlpackage /a:export /scs:&quot;Data Source&#x3D;...Initial Catalog&#x3D;...&quot; /ua:true /tid:&quot;mytenant.onmicrosoft.com&quot;
Indeed, that&#x27;s what I attempted. But UniversalAuthentication (required to authenticate with MFA) doesn&#x27;t seem to work as expected on Linux. You would expect that a browser would be launched to login to the application (since MFA won&#x27;t work without a browser). However, the command above doesn&#x27;t work.
Looking through the SqlPackage help, I see that there is a /AccessToken option. We can manually obtain an access token and use it to authenticate. Access tokens can be obtained using the Azure CLI, using the command az account get-access token --resource https://database.windows.net/. This will return a JSON body containing (among other things) the access token to use. Copy and paste this into an environment variable ACCESS_TOKEN, and then the full sqlpackage invocation becomes:
sqlpackage /a:export /at:&quot;$ACCESS_TOKEN&quot; /scs:&quot;Data Source&#x3D;...&quot; /ua:True ...</span>

Execution context
Scope
Lexical scope
Dynamic scope
Our Javascript code gets executed by the Javascript engine which creates an execution context. The execution context is like a small world or planet where our code run.

A scope is the visibility of a variable meaning, where that variable can be accessed. Scope are of types lexical and dynamic scope.

                    <span>Whatsup guys. First I wanted to say that everyone in the dev.to community has been super welcoming and friendly. Nice to know there are still people out there.
The reason for this post. I started a site that is a network for developers to seek &amp; give advice over video chat. 
https://p-pl.com is the site
For instance, if you are an expert in React.js, you can have other people connect with you. You as an expert can also bill for your time. (Hourly rate)
Or if you&#x27;re seeking advice, you can search for and request to connect with other users that are online at that given moment. If they accept the call, you are immediately brought to the video chat portal to hash out your code issues or anything else.
Once the interaction ends, each user can rate eachother based on professionality, expertise etc. Think of it almost like an uber for information.
You as a user are ranked higher in the results based on your reviews as well as the meta data your provide in your profile.
This was a 2 1/2 year project and I just want it in the right hands. I will be posting tutorials later on how to use the site, core features etc.
What I&#x27;m looking to do is build the network full of JavaScript developers so that the community is rich with support in this language. Eventually then to move on to other languages.</span>

                    <span>Docker is a software platform that enables packaging an application into containers. These containers represent isolated environments that provide everything necessary to run the application. Dockerizing an application refers to packaging it in a Docker image to run in one or more containers.
Dockerizing an application involves specifying everything needed to run the application in a Dockerfile and then using the file to build a specialized Docker image that can be shared to multiple machines. A Docker image is a reproducible environment for the application that guarantees portability across machines.

                    <span>EJS √© uma linguagem de template que utiliza javascript para gerar HTML, al√©m de compartilhar templates e dados com outras p√°ginas. Este post √© para demonstrar como utilizar uma class active para demonstrar ao user a p√°gina que est√° sendo acessada no momento em uma aplica√ß√£o Node utilizando EJS como template engine.
Clicando aqui voc√™ pode clonar um boilerplate com a configura√ß√£o m√≠nina para a aplica√ß√£o funcionar.
Com a aplica√ß√£o rodando vamos l√°... Apenas para entender, olhando o projeto podemos notar a seguinte estrutura:
Views - diret√≥rio que a aplica√ß√£o olha para encontrar os arquivos ejs.
Public - diret√≥rio que olha para os arquivos est√°ticos.
Routes - diret√≥rio para definir qual rota ir√° redenrizar o template.

I have created an npm library and published it to NPM and Github to validate form fields very easily. Let‚Äôs see what it can do?
npm install is-validate

const { isEmail } &#x3D;  require(&quot;is-validate&quot;)

const isValidate &#x3D; require(&#x27;is-validate&#x27;);

Example:

const { isEmail } &#x3D;  require(&quot;is-validate&quot;)
console.log(isEmail(&#x27;harendraverma21@gmail.com&#x27;))

This is not the first time something like this happens, but I wouldn&#x27;t blame NPM for this. I wouldn&#x27;t even blame the Node.js community or the creator of such a popular library.
On October 22nd the owner of the UA-Parser.js package realized his NPM account had been hijacked and that someone else (the attacker) had pushed 3 different new versions (0.7.29, 0.8.0 and 1.0.0) of his package including, within it, malicious code for both Linux and Windows.
And while the effect of the attack is important and it probably did a lot of damage while it was active, that&#x27;s not my focus today.
This is not the first time something like this happens. In fact in 2018 something similar happened. A hacker got ownership of a very popular repository through social engineering and procee‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Fun thing about learning JS is that you have to find its pattern for yourself. There&#x27;s always something new. 
My file structure is as follows
-server.js
-views
    -index.html
-public
    -style.css


Then a beginner coder like me will think &quot;to connect HTML file to css file (i.e. make the html wear the css style), we will have to set href of the link tag like this...&quot;


Yeah, obviously! Public folder is one folder up so &#x27;..&#x27; is so obvious! 
Now, forget the tag above and we will work with this href instead


and we can still connect html and css together. 
To start off, I will create a file in the root folder. And, I will give this file cliche name, SERVER.JS. We will set up express here.

                    <span>Social engineering is a serious security risk, but its origins predate the digital age.



  
  
  
Let‚Äôs face it. We all make mistakes. Even the most diligent, well-intentioned employee can inadvertently open the floodgates to an attack. Telecoms giant Verizon illustrated this earlier this year, when it published the 2021 edition of its Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR).
The DBIR examined approximately 5,250 successful security breaches, gathering data about the methodologies used. It found 35 percent of attacks incorporated a social element. Of these, the vast majority (85%) used phishing tactics.
In short: you can deploy all the technological measures you want, but unless you address the human element, an attacker can defeat your defenses with a simple phone call or email.

                    <span>Hey there! üëã
I was doing a bit of bug-hunting in an old project of mine when I found an interesting bug. Can you find it?
If you know your security or PHP this might be quite easy for you. Otherwise, it might be a good exercise.
This is the request you would make to the server:
curl --location --request POST &#x27;https://super.secure-api.com/check-pin&#x27; \
    --header &#x27;Content-Type: application/json&#x27; \
    --header &#x27;Authorization: Bearer &#x27; \
    --data-raw &#x27;{
      &quot;pin&quot;: 
    }&#x27;

And this is the code for that given endpoint (/check-pin)
if($params[&#x27;pin&#x27;] !&#x3D; $user-&gt;getPin()) {
  throw new HttpException(403, &quot;The pin is incorrect&quot;);
}

return &quot;The pin is correct!&quot;;

PD: This is just a demo, not real code. You should never check passwords/pins/secrets like this.
pin to be able to bypass the check?


I will release a post in a couple of days explaining the bug in detail and how to fix it.</span>

With regard to battery safety and security, common BMS duties include voltage and current control, thermal management solutions, fire protection, and cybersecurity. This post elaborates on the main hazards that can cross a battery‚Äôs path and how a BMS can overcome them.
A rechargeable battery is a key element of every battery energy storage system (BESS). But this is also a rather sophisticated and unstable component that needs careful treatment and constant attention. But how can you provide all that?

Welcome to the second Type | Treat challenge! These challenges are a series of blog posts which have 2 code challenges in, one for beginners and one for intermediate TypeScript programmers. We&#x27;re on day two, which means going over the answers from yesterday and 2 new challenges.
The first part of the solution for this challenge used as const to trigger &quot;Literal Inference&quot; - basically telling TypeScript &quot;Don&#x27;t convert the array to string[] but consider it a constant set of string literals. This meant that playlist[0] stopped returning string and started returning &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow by The Monotones.mp3&quot;.

Today we&#x27;re starting up our second year of Type | Treat (or &quot;Type or Treat&quot;.) We will be presenting some &quot;spooky&quot; code challenges that will allow you to dig deeper into the TypeScript language in a fun way.
Starting right now, a new code challenge will be posted every weekday, along with its solution the day after. The last solution will be posted on the weekend.
In order to participate you only need to be able to access the TypeScript website. Though ideally, you share with us your answers via our dev.to blog post mirrors, here, or via Twitter to @TypeScript.
You will want to start here on the blog to find the details on the code challenges for the day. Each post contains 2 links to different challenges which run in the TypeScript playground. Via the playground,‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Basically, I needed a means to provide a spinner that blocked functionality while API calls were in-flight. Additionally, I wanted to take into account that there could be more than one API request in-flight, at one time.
DEMO HERE
REPO HERE
My first attempt was to use an interceptor service that contained a BehaviorSubject (Observable). I set it up to maintain a counter and set the observable&#x27;s value to true if there were more than zero (0) requests in-flight.
Through heavy use of the console.log functionality, I came to realize that the interceptor was not always active, even though I was following proper singleton patterns.
The second attempt went more smoothly.
I had a second service (a handler) that maintained the counts and the BehaviorSubject. This one worked &quot;like a charm.&quot;

                    <span>The Why


Lots of developers use Linux, but &quot;Linux&quot; is a vast category.  There are a lot of similarities, but a lot of differences, too.  Ubuntu and Fedora look and feel pretty similar until you try to install a package - whoops, apt is a little different than dnf. Specific system settings may be stored in different places, and particular commands may be included by default in one but not the other.  Then there&#x27;s even more niche stuff like Arch, which you install piece by piece from a very minimal package set, or Gentoo, which is similar to Arch with the additional caveat that the user compiles all the software locally for their specific hardware.  Users of these distros may end up with pretty different-looking operating systems that all fall under the broad Linux umbrella.

Gating your content can be something of a gamble. On the one hand, allowing users to prematurely access your product means that you might wind up serving a lot of users who you never truly monetize.

According to Blue Research, 54% of users will abandon a website if the registration process is too cumbersome. Good product designers know all too well that interrupting a user in their intended path can be a great way to lose them.

                    <span>An API exposes valuable data to be used by programs. REST is a standardized client-server architecture for APIs where resources are available at specific URLs. The client can query them (GET) and even write, modify and delete entries when specific endpoints exist.
GraphQL is a new approach. In most configurations, you will use one endpoint only to combine multiple queries in a single request.
It has many advantages over REST that can make sense, but it might raise security issues as well:
the default /graphql endpoint URL is quite often used in production, so it is an easy target
the introspection feature is sometimes left enabled on production, which can lead to non-public information disclosure
self-inflicted DDOS (distributed denial-of-service) are not uncommon because GraphQL queries can be significantly larger than REST queries (e.g., 10000 users and 70 posts per user makes 700 000 nodes to retrieve)
GraphQL schema design can be quite challenging, leading to expose more information than intended
string injections are not uncommon as queries are usually wrapped in JSON
everything connects to everything else, sometimes leading to authorization bypass when checks are not performed for each node
However, there are measures you can take:
don&#x27;t use the default endpoint /graphql
force SSL everywhere
use standardized authentication such as JWTs or OAuth
limit GraphQL operations to authenticated requests, as you&#x27;re not a public platform such as GitHub
limit query depth and add pagination
use static queries and avoid dynamically generated queries at runtime when it&#x27;s possible
disable logging, debugging and exploration tools on production (including GraphiQL), not only for security reasons but also for performance

                    <span>One of the things I love about GraphQL is how straightforward it is to get up and running with little to no experience. Using a browser-based GraphiQL interface ‚Äî such as the GraphiQL explorer provided by Contentful ‚Äî you can inspect your schema right there in the browser, and construct your queries in no time. But how can you make sure your GraphQL queries are safe from nasties? Let‚Äôs find out.
To inspect your schema in Contentful‚Äôs GraphiQL interface and construct a GraphQL query, enter this URL in your browser, and swap out the SPACE_ID for your Contentful space ID, and ACCESS_TOKEN for your Contentful Delivery API Key.

Policy checks - thanks to #kyverno team, e.g. Jim Bugwadia has a good check rule at https://lnkd.in/gtUy-UNu ! Another good reason to use Policy in k8s to safeguard any CVEs.


there are 3 diff. k8s ingress controllers - see my post at

                    <span>It&#x27;s time to talk about it... Not Next, nor Nuxt, but Nest!
Some time ago, I challenged myself to build a robust backend solution in JavaScript. Many developers believe that JavaScript isn&#x27;t secure enough, efficient or simply organized to manage data through APIs. I&#x27;ll convince you otherwise....
For this new project, I chose technologies that are on the rise, in particular PostgreSQL but especially NestJS. So, I gave up my good old database that is MongoDB, in favor of a more traditional database.
NB: I was a little bit rusty at first, but going back to relational database was a real good idea; if only to retrieve data from several tables in one call, unlike NoSQL which requires as many calls as there are documents to query... Finally, SQL is like riding a bike, it&#x27;s unforgettable üòâ

                    <span>If you working with Node.js you probably interact with the database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and etc) via ORM. 
But sometimes typical ORM does not cover our needs. 
For example, when we need to write nested queries with aggregation in PostgreSQL. Or when the performance of a generated query using ORM does not suit us.
But what about solutions what will get to us good developer productivity like ORM, and will get a flexible API to interact with the database like pure SQL code.
If you have encountered such situations, then this post is for you!
In most cases we need some abstraction what will give to us typical operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete Operations). And Repository pattern will give to us this abstract Data Layer to interact with any database.

                    <span>Privacy and transparency are some of the most important requirements that most modern social networks like Facebook and Instagram do not meet. 
One of the best examples of privacy nightmare is TikTok. It collects some very troubling data points such as the number of CPUs your device has, available disk space, your IP &amp; MAC addresses, whether your phone is jailbroken, and so much more, which does not have anything to do with TikTok. Imagine that there are so many more applications and websites that do essentially the same thing and sell your information to 3rd party advertisers. Internet is rapidly becoming a place where one company can easily predict what type of person you are, based on all data points that they collected over time.
To end this, I have open-sourced the social network that I was working on for more than a year! It is called Polygon and the main goal for it is to be a social network that is not hungry for your data. Both the core and front-end are written in TypeScript and are seeking support from the open-source community. We also have a hosting guide that is written in Python.There is also some tooling written in Go. My main goal is to make it a private, easy-to-use, and crisp social network which will be adapted by privacy and open-source enthusiasts all over the world. 
Polygon is also open for Hacktoberfest contributions, which means that both beginners and professionals can contribute to the project and learn something new!
You can find all projects related to Polygon at: https://github.com/polygon-isecure

That being said, if anyone has time to check it out and provide feedback, here is the link. The library provides useful methods when working with dates in JavaScript/TypeScript. I wrote it in TypeScript, so you get type declarations right out of the box. 
I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback. Also, if you want to contribute, just let me know :)
This has definitely been a learning experience for me. I live in my own little world as a front end developer. I install and use npm packages but never really considered that anyone can write one and publish it.</span>

                    <span>Validating tags in Angular Material does not work as it should out-of-the-box, so I am sharing my custom version. This assumes you are familiar with basic angular reactive forms, and are using Angular Material Chips to handle your tags input.
Here you will be able to produce min and required errors, as well as display them in mat-error as expected out-of-the-box. Unfortunately, Angular does not work this way out-of-the-box.

There is not a custom validator in Angular for confirm passwords, so I found one here. I don&#x27;t want to have to rewrite the code in my component, so here is my version that just &#x27;works&#x27; out of the box.
Create a file called form-validators.ts with this:

Suppose you have an angular application and need to automate building and deployment also you are looking for how to do it. 
You are in the right place.
üëâ Angular application
üëâ Github account
üëâ surge token and domain name
üëâ Push your application to github repo
üëâ Add a  folder .github/workflows/ in the root location and create a file with an extension of yml inside of it . Lets say (deplyment.yml) ( .github/workflows/)
  name : Build and Deploy

If you omit name inside the workflow file, GitHub will set workflow name to the workflow file path relative to the root of the repository.
A workflow trigger is required for a workflow. We need to provide event that trigger the workflow

Maintainer and what was my end goal behind maintaining &quot;ComEve&quot;?


Maintainers are the keystone of open source. This year‚Äôs Hacktoberfest has a new, added focus: empowering open source maintainers.
Community Events Platform Project by this Hacktoberfest is to support and guide new joiners who are willing to contribute, I opened everything in terms of issues and created basic issues and middle level issues, so that every level of joiner can contribute, sometimes I hookup the calls with joiners, I did the guidance calls with contributors from India and South Africa to give them a overall walk through.

Github - ComEve

Volunteer and giving up personal time to create something of value for the world.
Reviewing and Merging Pull Request
Collaborations with Developers throughout the world.
Maintain a project when you own a team.
Be respectful and allow people to contribute in a way that makes the project better.
Encourage developers however the pull request is buggy and production breaking ding, motivate them to fix and fly high as per terms of opensource.

Download WSA preview from here:
https://server.deltaonealpha.workers.dev/MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_1.7.32815.0_neutral___8wekyb3d8bbwe.Msixbundle
Then install it using Powershell with the command:
add-appxpackage -Path &quot;
&quot;
Downloading and installing app should be through amazon store but for non-US countries its not available in the preview, so you will have to manually download an apk and install it using &quot;adb install&quot;.
Install ADB as instructed here: https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/
Open the Windows Subsystem for Linux app and enable developer mode. An IP address and port will be shown, use this to execute the ADB command:
adb connect 
Now simply open Windows PowerShell or CMD and type
adb install &quot;
&quot;
That&#x27;s it, and your APK will be installed, all you need to do now is open Start and find your installed app in the list!
NOTE: Make sure WSA is running. To run WSA open the app and select open &quot;File&quot;.</span>

                    <span>SSH ( Secure Shell ) is a program that is used to create a secure connection between two network enabled hosts. With this connection, the user will be able to get remote access to machines or transfer data between machines. Both these operations are critical from a security point of view, and even one slight vulnerability will cause a heavy damage.
SSH server: It is the component that will enable a machine to listen or be open to accept SSH connections from clients.
SSH client: It is the component that will allow a machine to connect to a remote server that is listening to incoming connections.
There are two major versions of SSH. SSH version 1 &amp; SSH version 2.

Firstly, the default cmd prompt in windows is not supported, hence download the windows terminal from here


Install python3 &amp; pip3


Run the following command to download and setup the Pokemon-Terminal

                    <span>The modern internet today is programmed in such a way that, the traffic is encrypted. Now, what does this encryption mean? In simple terms, encryption ensures only those who are meant to understand the information do so, and for others, it is just gibberish.
Encryption transforms readable plaintext into unreadable ciphertext that only the intended users can understand. This prevents attackers from making sense of the data even if they get access to it. The intended users will be aware of how to convert the ciphertext into plaintext, a process known as decryption.
A simple encryption example is, say alphabet A -&gt; 1, B -&gt; 2, C -&gt; 3, so on.. So the word CAB would be 321. The receiver will convert the 321 back to plain text by mapping the numbers to alphabets -&gt; CAB.

                    <span>So, you started writing an app or library in Solid.js and TypeScript - what an excellent choice - but now you want to unit test everything as fast as possible to avoid regressions.
We already know how to do this with jest, but while it is pretty convenient and quite easy to set up, it&#x27;s also considerably slow and somewhat opinionated. Unlike more lightweight test runners, it also has a built-in code transformation API, a jsdom-based DOM environment and chooses browser conditional exports by default.
So what we need to run our tests without jest is:
Code transformation
DOM environment
Choosing browser exports
To save even more of your precious time, I already did all this work for you. You just need to install
