Wait, what&#x27;s Autohotkey? Jeffrey, my boy, you can&#x27;t call yourself a programmer until you&#x27;ve used Autohotkey to create a message box! Just a little joke. But seriously, you should use Autohotkey to automate stuff and just use your computer way faster. And use my site to find scripts already made for you :). https://scriptmime.com

The servers live in Hetzner Cloud (which I highly recommend, as they are very affordable).

On 24th April, Angular announced the deprecation of their end-to-end (E2E) testing tool, Protractor. It remains unclear whether there will be a successor or if Angular will delegate this to its users. At the time of this writing, WebDriver.IO, TestCafé and Cypress have come up with schematics for the Angular CLI.
This is the follow-up to my article about E2E frameworks in general in which I will help you get started with E2E testing in Cypress.

                    <span>The Kubernetes Operator in this project is in Alpha version. Use at your own risk
NFS Operator adds three important features for a NFS in Kubernetes. It allows setting NFS export ownership/permissions, enables PVC autoexpansion and reduces the number of manual resource definitions. It is based on Rook NFS v1.6 and Ansible Operator SDK. Thus, the new features are in addition to those in Rook NFS. The extra functions it adds on top of Rook NFS are:
It is able to set ownership and permissions for the (NFS) Server export
It is able to autoexpand/adjust the value of (NFS) Server PVC storage size
It automatically creates a StorageClass with a (NFS) Server
There are some restrictions compared to Rook NFS:
Only one export/PVC per (NFS) Server
Prerequisites are the same as Rook NFS. Therefore, Rook…</span>

APIs have revolutionized web development, and the eCommerce business is no exception. Expanding the customer base, effectively managing customer data, and improving functionality are few benefits that API-based eCommerce integration offers.

                    <span>In the last article we studied what is an AMI and how it helps in creating preconfigured EC2 instances on AWS. In this exercise we will learn how to create a new AWS AMI with preconfigured Apache server on it.
To create an AMI launch and EC2 instance like in the second article of this series. Use the following script in userdata in place of script provided in the tutorial.




#!/bin/bash
# Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd



Right click on the instance and select Images and Templates &gt; Create Image



Select an Image name and Description



Add a tag of you want to add a tag, let rest of the settings remain same. Click create image to create an image



This we will create a snapshot of the root EBS volume and create a image from it


Now wait for a few minutes after that check the AMI tab under Images to see if the AMI is created




One this is done follow second article of this series to create the instance again but in the second step instead of selecting Amazon AMI select My AMI there you will see your AMI select that and in the userdata add this script instead of the one there




#!/bin/bash
echo &quot;
Hello World from $(hostname -f)
&quot; &gt; /var/www/html/index.html

beacuse we already installed apache server in our AMI

Once you are done with the select the public IP address you will see the same page running in the server.


Clean all these Ec2 instances they may cost you money

                    <span>How can developers be more productive? Devs need to be focused for long hours, often with critical deadlines and bugs to be squashed.
Can we rely on waking up motivated every day to be disciplined and productive to get things done? No, being productive is a function of the environment we create for coding, the ritual we set, and the practices we follow.
Coined by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in 1975, flow state describes a feeling where you become fully immersed with whatever you are doing. In his research studies, participants described the feeling of being in flow state as:
a musician describes it as a feeling of being ecstatic to the point that you feel as though you almost don&#x27;t exist

                    <span>It is the most difficult for beginner to create Multiple Pull Request in GitHub they say that the Previous PR commit merge with it. 
Before following the steps given below create a PR
git fetch --all
This command will fetch all the data from upstream and origin to your local repository
git reset --hard origin/master
This is the most Important step so what happen is that our local repo contain previous commit in it so we have to remove it before new committing so we write the above command which simply reset the local repo as remote repo&#x27;s master branch. This will set the local repo as the last merge Pull Request...

I am a big fan of the Microsoft Azure platform. It is super easy to pick and choose the pieces that you need to build a great scalable digital platform with little effort. These pieces, or Azure resources to be exact, provide the required service without having to worry about the installation and maintenance of the underlaying infrastructure.
With great power comes great responsibility. That is why it is important to keep in mind that you pay for what you use. In other words: if you create a resource, the meter will start running. It is therefore good to think about this in advance and come up with a cost saving plan. After all, it is a shame to pay for something that you do not (fully) use.

                    <span>Secure DevOps Kit for Azure (AzSK) is being phased out through FY21.The AzSK is transitioning to a more scalable and robust solution called Azure Tenant Security scanner (AzTS) which is based on Azure Functions and a central scan model where scans are performed via a managed identity with Reader access to subscriptions configured at management group level. This new approach helps us scale efficiently and with less process overhead to get the same level of visibility to compliance of several thousand subscriptions. It is also designed to help accelerate our migration to native security offerings in Azure such as Policy, Security Center, Management Groups, Azure Resource Graph, etc.
Steps:
Download the Power Shell Scripts from Here ( https://github.com/azsk/AzTS-docs/blob/main/TemplateFiles/DeploymentFiles.zip?raw&#x3D;1)
Open the DeploymentFolder that you had created and open the ExecutionScript.ps script with Power Shell IDE



Replace the information for




$MIHostingSubId,$HostSubscriptionId - Your Subscription ID
4.After execute the scripts, you will saw the azure services are setup in your resources group.

5.When you open the webapp, the data is still blank.
Start-AzSKTenantSecuritySolutionOnDemandScan -SubscriptionId $HostSubscriptionId1 -ScanHostRGName $HostResourceGroupName1

After end of execution, the messages will display
At the end,Open the webapp again,you will get the results as below

                    <span>In the last tutorial we created lots of EC2 instances for auto scaling but what if we want our EC2 instances configured already before adding them to our ASG. This is where AMI comes in an AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image. It allows you to customize your EC2 instance. With an AMI you can add your on configured software, config, monitoring and operating system.
If you create your own AMI then AWS saves all the configurations and software in an EBS snapshot in such a way that it can start an EC2 instance can be configured from that AMI. After that we can launch our EC2 instances from these AMI. These are available to use in a region and can be copied across regions to take advantage of global presence of AWS.
We were already using AMI from the first time we created an EC2 instance. Where we selected Amazon Linux 2 AMI in the second step while creating an EC2 instance. These are three types of AMI available on AWS.
Public AMI provided by AWS 
Marketplace AMI which we saw in the second part of this series where AMI with preconfigured software. 
Private AMI: AMI which we build and maintain ourselves.
So you can see AMI are very powerful we can get preconfigured EC2 instances from it. Which can be put behind a load balancer and an ASG to get a group of preconfigured servers where we can deploy our apps. Next up we will do a Hands on how to create an AMI.</span>

Acredito que umas das primeiras considerações quando montamos nosso setup de self-hosting é pensar como isso vai se organizar e onde vai ficar cada coisa.
Self-hosting não é ser “contra a nuvem” mas sim um movimento para ter controle dos nossos dados e aplicações que usamos, mesmo usando a nuvem nós que vamos configurar tudo e ter controle de como cada coisa funciona.
Outro modelo é hospedar “tudo em casa” (chamado de on-premise), funciona muito bem. Mas um desafio que logo vamos abordar é abrir a conexão da sua operadora para acessar seus serviços fora de casa.
Daí surge um terceiro modelo: o híbrido, parte das coisas que necessitam de velocidade ficam em casa e o restante que precisa acessar fora de c…</span>

                    <span>Now, We are ready to build our first Flutter AppImage app 🚀


Firstly , we will change our working directory to the project directory.
$ cd flutter_appimage

1- Create folder  AppDir
$ mkdir AppDir

2- Generate the YAML recipe file required to build the AppImage
$ appimage-builder --generate

this command will prompt some questions. Here is the final output :

                    <span>Flutter is one of the fastest-growing cross-platform UI frameworks with a great and powerful community which has a great part of Flutter success.

Lately, Flutter announced desktop support including Linux which got the attention of big corporates like Canonical (Publisher of Ubuntu), and lately announced that they are rebuilding Ubuntu Desktop Installer using Flutter.
Flutter official docs also have a section on how to build and package Flutter Linux app in Snap (Linux Universal Package Manager) and ship it to Snap Store. here
So it will be interesting if we tried to package Flutter Apps using another universal package manager which is AppImage.
Linux OS (I will use Manjaro)

                    <span>Vim and BASH?


Bash Scripting is a powerful skill to have as a programmer because we find Linux almost everywhere and to get through it you must have a command over its interface which is generally the BASH shell. Vim is a great option for doing this, or probably the best out there! Because Vim is pre-installed in almost every Linux distribution. This is not an in-depth setup for BASH on Vim, it is a simple editorial on starting up BASH scripting on the Vim editor. So without wasting time on &quot;Vim features&quot; let&#x27;s dive in with the setup for BASH in Vim.
Setting up a bash script doesn&#x27;t require much code but still in some cases it can be a bit hassle and to avoid the repetitive task, one can easily set up a macro for the boilerplate BASH script.

The goal here is to create a fully-functional forever-updateable system. So the two things that this is not:
it is not just a “live boot”;
this is not just something to then use to install Linux onto the internal hard drive of a computer.
Rather, this is Linux ready to plug into the USB port of any computer that can be told to boot from that. Every time you boot this system, it will inspect and deal with the hardware that it finds.
This way, the external USB drive becomes your &quot;system&quot;, and the computer is just the commodity used at the time. Depending on your use cases:

A Linux-based hardware RAID is hardly a good example of a reliable storage system – if one of the disks within the array gets disconnected, the whole RAID can’t be mounted, and all the information becomes inaccessible in a second. In this case, you will need a special utility to rebuild the array with the remaining (healthy) drives. It will find and display the data which is still there, and restore this information.

Core Modules
local Modules
Third-party modules or community based modules
Let’s now explain each in little more details :
Core Modules:Nodejs has many built-in modules that are part of the platform and comes with Node.js installation.
Some of the most used core modules are:
fs: Allows you to manipulate (create/read/write) files and directories.
path: utilities to work with files and directories paths.
http: create HTTP servers and clients for web development.

                    <span>Getting Started with FreshBooks NodeJS SDK - Expenses &amp; Invoices
We have handled http calls, http retries, Idempotency, consistent request and response structures and many more.This way you get to focus on your business logic rather than figuring out how the FreshBooks API works. 
Prerequisites 
A FreshBooks Developer account. If you don&#x27;t have one, you can create one here.
Authenticate yourself on the FreshBooks API using Oauth2.0. No idea how to do that? No problem, we have an excellent tutorial here.
Basic knowledge of Async, Await and Node.js.
A code editor (e.g. VS Code, Sublime, Atom etc.)
Let&#x27;s get started!
In your Node project directory, install the FreshBooks NodeJs Client via npm or yarn
npm install @freshbooks/api 

yarn install @freshbooks/api

Get your FreshBooks Client ID

                    <span>The basic flow of the app:



User will provide a YouTube video link
The backend server will push this video link in the queue to process the download
When the job popped     from the queue for  processing, the backend emits the event for the client
The client listens to the event and shows appropriate messages
Users will able to download videos from a server
We will use Socket.io for the emitting events and processing and handling jobs will use the Bull package.

                    <span>By the time I had written 15 blog articles on my website, it was getting a little tricky to find what I was looking for in a hurry! So I set out to implement search functionality on my blog.
After researching my options, I decided to try out Algolia. Algolia is a flexible hosted search and discovery API that comes with a generous free community plan. It provides up to 10,000 search requests per month, pre-built UI libraries (which we’ll use in this tutorial), natural language processing and many other features. What’s more, the engineers at Algolia are wonderfully helpful! I’d especially like to extend a huge thank you to LukyVJ, who showed up while I was learning about Algolia live on Twitch and helped me navigate the docs for the UI library.

The concept is not new as some people did this before me like:
Tony Dinh
Erika Heidi
Devesh
My first thoughts were to build this in PHP and use the ImageMagick library. However, I then thought a node script might be more fun to play with.
You can see the end-result on my own Twitter page: @DailyDevTips1

But what exactly should happen?
script runs
get the latest 3 Twitter followers
download profile pictures for these three people
get the latest blog article title
place profile pictures and title on a placeholder image
upload placeholder image to Twitter
🔁 run every 60 seconds
With this plan in place, we can act on each step.
Let&#x27;s dive straight into it.

                    <span>With the introduction of CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) policy, frontend code won&#x27;t have access to a response if correct CORS headers are not embedded in it. If you own the backend code, then it becomes easy to handle since you can just add the headers before sending the response. If it&#x27;s not owned by you, then you have no way to add headers directly before the response reaches your frontend code. 

Manually inserting them using GUI can be tiresome. The easiest way to get past this is to use a proxy server.
Check out this repo: add-cors
It includes a public proxy server which can be used to fetch data by adding CORS headers so that it&#x27;s not blocked by CORS policy. A better way is to create your own proxy and use it without relying on a public server. The repo contains instructions on how to go about creating a proxy and host it on Heroku.
   git clone https://github.com/das-jishu/add-cors.git
   cd add-cors/
   npm install
   heroku create cors-everywhere //cors-everywhere is an example. Use a unique name for heroku to create.
   git push heroku master

The code is fairly simple which enables someone to write it from scratch instead of cloning the code and add more features and utility as needed.</span>

                    <span>Creating CRUD without security in mind can bring you to security disaster. Check out this article how to do it correctly.
I am an open-source developer working on Databunker. Today I got a question from one of the guys on a social network.
It is totally true, you can go DIY. On the other hand, Databunker grew to be a better solution than you can think about.
Databunker is a special application server used for the secure storage of customer data. It is not a full-fledged database. In the backend, it is using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite to store encrypted customer records. The product comes with full GDPR compliance and is built with privacy-by-design architecture.
Any company implementing Databunker has a quick and easy way for GDPR and privacy-by-design compliance in addition to much better security.
Hashicorp Vault is a great product. It is built for completely different use cases.
For example, when saving records in Databunker, Databunker knows to extract user email, phone, login identity, and custom identity and built a secure hashed-based index to do a quick user record lookup.
User record CRUD is just a part of the service. In Databunker, you have a secure session storage API, temp shareable identities API, automatic record expiration and removal, compliance with pseudonymization, DPO management, user-accessible UI, and more.
Besides you can go with a free version with an MIT license.
It is up to you to go with Databunker or build your own solution.
Just do not leave customer data unencrypted.

Nothing appears to display when going to the site so let&#x27;s try the following.
Right-click on the page.

Still nothing is displaying.

Alright, lets check out the other ports open on the box.

Just disable Print Spooler service on Windows 10 and Windows Server environments.
Open PowerShell as Administrator
Run Command:




Stop-Service -Name Spooler -Force

Prevent the service from starting back up again during restart:
Set-Service -Name Spooler -StartupType Disabled

We hope this helps save you from ransomware.

A Linux-based hardware RAID is hardly a good example of a reliable storage system – if one of the disks within the array gets disconnected, the whole RAID can’t be mounted, and all the information becomes inaccessible in a second. In this case, you will need a special utility to rebuild the array with the remaining (healthy) drives. It will find and display the data which is still there, and restore this information.
We will perform all the tests with Hetman RAID Recovery. Its main purpose is to search and restore information from inoperable drives…</span>

You also probably might have heard that modern frontend frameworks like React or Angular are XSS safe (due to escaping). Still, though there are some XSS caveats worth remembering: 
Imagine you have a form where the user adds an address to his page/Facebook/Instagram etc. You might have HTML code like:
User page


When taking input from the user which later will be displayed in a href tag (or any other &quot;new link&quot; click tag-like frame) it is important to validate the protocol of the URL. User can simply add their page with javascript protocol and execute XSS.
User page
To conclude: to defend against XSS, besides escaping user input do validate the protocol of URL. Let me know if you have any other interesting thoughts when it comes to XSS!</span>

If you’re new to GraphQL on Azure, I’d encourage you to check out part 3 in which I go over how we can create a GraphQL server using Apollo and deploy that to an Azure Function, which is the process we’ll be using for this post.

Self-hosting não é ser “contra a nuvem” mas sim um movimento para ter controle dos nossos dados e aplicações que usamos, mesmo usando a nuvem nós que vamos configurar tudo e ter controle de como cada coisa funciona.
Outro modelo é hospedar “tudo em casa” (chamado de on-premise), funciona muito bem. Mas um desafio que logo vamos abordar é abrir a conexão da sua operadora para acessar seus serviços fora de casa.
Daí surge um terceiro modelo: o híbrido, parte das coisas que necessitam de velocidade ficam em casa e o restante que precisa acessar fora de c…</span>

                    <span>When you start learning TypeScript, you will come across two types - any and unknown.
any - The any type allows us to assign literally “any” particular value to that variable, simulating what we know as plain JavaScript.
unknown -  The unknown type is the type-safe counterpart of any. Anything is assignable to unknown, but unknown isn&#x27;t assignable to anything but itself and any without a type assertion or a control flow based narrowing.
Errghh... Let&#x27;s understand with an example.
let age: number;
let userAge: any;

userAge &#x3D; &#x27;This is some age&#x27;;
userAge &#x3D; 20;

age &#x3D; userAge;

And yes, This code works! 🎉 Type of userAge is any so it can be assigned any value - string, number etc.
let age: number;
let userAge: unknown;

userAge &#x3D; &#x27;This is some age&#x27;;
userAge &#x3D; 20;

age &#x3D; userAge;

The statement age&#x3D;userAge gives an error. I mean, the type is unknown so what is the problem here? To assign an unknown value to a value with a fixed type, we have to do some quick type check!
let age: number;
let userAge: unknown;

userAge &#x3D; &#x27;This is some age&#x27;;
userAge &#x3D; 20;

if(typeof userAge &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;number&#x27;) {
  age &#x3D; userAge;
}

And now this works too! 🎉
When to use what? 🤔
unknown is a better choice if you know what you want to do with that value eventually. 
I hope you learnt at least something. Also, this was my first ever post on Dev! Thank you for reading :)</span>

                    <span>Pretty import paths?


We&#x27;ve all seen relative file import paths inside react applications. If you structure your apps like me you end up with terribly long paths to import other components. Auto-import can take care of that for you automatically, but isn&#x27;t it hard to read and let&#x27;s be honest, very, very error prone?
One way to solve this issue is adding webpack aliases. Now if you created your application using the create-react-app cli, you will notice that there isn&#x27;t a webpack config to mess with unless you eject it running npm run eject, which will expose the entire configuration and makes you responsible of maintaining it. I prefer not ejecting my react application because I prefer the ease of use using react-scripts, so there must be another way.

                    <span>An interesting feature was added to TypeScript recently that will improve the ergonomics of code that relies on type narrowing or discrimination:
TS 4.4 (currently beta) can infer when a variable&#x27;s type implies something about the type of another.
A simple example given in the PR description:
function fn(x: unknown) {
    const isString &#x3D; typeof x &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;string&#x27;
    if (isString) {
        x.length  // Ok
    }
}

In TS 4.3.4, accessing x.length is a type error...
Even though we know that if (and only if) isString is true, x must be a string, the type checker doesn&#x27;t know that!
This is because isString is just a stupid old boolean - it doesn&#x27;t know or care why it happens to be true or false.
For TS to understand the expression implies something about its inputs, typeof x &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;string&#x27; has to …</span>

                    <span>TypeScript comes with a number of built-in utility types. These types can be very useful. They can help you create new, and also very advanced, types from existing with only a bit of code. In this article, you will learn about some of these utility types, how they work and also how to use them.
The goal of this two-part article is to help you understand TypeScript built-in utility types. In this second part, you will learn about the last eight of these types. These are NonNullable, Parameters, ConstructorParameters, ReturnType, InstanceType, ThisParameterType, OmitThisParameter and ThisType.
If you want to learn about the previous eight, take a look at the part 1. Part 1 will help you understand and work with Partial, Required, Readonly, Record, Pick, Omit, Exclude and Extract. Otherwise, …</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve found that Day.js and Moment.js&#x27;s relative time support to be buggy, especially when dealing with very recent timestamps.
Here&#x27;s an implementation in TypeScript:
// much love https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6108819/javascript-timestamp-to-relative-time

const units &#x3D; {
    year: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 * 365,
    month: (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 * 365) / 12,
    day: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
    hour: 60 * 60 * 1000,
    minute: 60 * 1000,
    second: 1000
};

const rtf &#x3D; new Intl.RelativeTimeFormat(&#x27;en&#x27;, { numeric: &#x27;auto&#x27; });

export const getRelativeTime &#x3D; (d1: Date, d2 &#x3D; new Date()): string &#x3D;&gt; {
    const elapsed &#x3D; d1.getTime() - d2.getTime();

    // &quot;Math.abs&quot; accounts for both &quot;past&quot; &amp; &quot;future&quot; scenarios
    for (const u in units) {
        if (Math.abs(elapsed) &gt; units[u] || u &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;second&#x27;) {
            return rtf.format(Math.round(elapsed / units[u]), u as Intl.RelativeTimeFormatUnit);
        }
    }
};


and raw JavaScript:
// much love https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6108819/javascript-timestamp-to-relative-time

const units &#x3D; {
    year: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 * 365,

Here is where the magic happens with this process. When I’ve identified duplicated data and move it to a central location not only does my code become more consistent and simplified but it is also more maintainable.
It is true that I am often working in prototype code so it really doesn’t “matter” that I have some duplication going on. Or even that the code isn’t maintainable because it’s all a prototype right now anyway.

                    <span>Welcome to the Angular 11 Tutorial Course, specially designed for beginners and busy developers. 
I create simple step-by-step tutorials which cover the version of Angular 2 to the latest Angular 11.
Angular is a client-side TypeScript based framework which is used to create dynamic web applications. 
-Support TypeScript
Components and services both are simply classes with decorators that mark their types and provide metadata which guide Angular to do things.
Every Angular application always has at least one component known as root component that connects a page hierarchy with page DOM. Each component defines a class that contains application data and logic, and is associated with an HTML template that defines a view to be displayed in a target environment.
NgModules are different from oth…</span>

                    <span>The focal point of this aide is to assist engineers with figuring out how to get an Angular application by executing client verification. You&#x27;ll improve an Angular starter application to rehearse the accompanying security ideas:
Configure Auth0
Install the Auth0 Angular SDK
Add Login to Your Application
Add Logout to Your Application
Show User Profile Information
At the point when you pursued Auth0, another application was made for you, or you might have made another one. You will require a few insights concerning that application to speak with Auth0. You can get these subtleties from the &quot;Application Settings&quot; area in the Auth0 dashboard.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a developer using mostly angular.js. My angular2+ experience is mostly some studying or courses from time to time. Therefore - I&#x27;m not using angular-cli on a daily basis, and I seems to upgrade node &amp; npm more often I generate a new angular2+ project.
The official doc, tells me to do as follow:
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
$ ng new my-project

I&#x27;m a bit bothered by this, because:
I&#x27;m not going to use that much before switching to the newer npm version
I don&#x27;t want to thing about any possible ways global version of angular cli would collide with local versions installed in projects
Besides, I really like the light-weight approach frameworks like Next.js or NuxtJS are allowing you to just start playing with their code generator.
Luckily, there is this alternative way of generating angular project:
$ npx -p @angular/cli ng my-project

as you can see it here:
it does the job:

Even though angular documentation seems to assume you have no reason of trying out their framework, unless you it&#x27;s your job and you need all the tooling all the time (maybe they are right about it); here we have an easier way of running their generator command, without turning our environment into angular-shop.</span>

Here are three methods. (1) and (2) are need to be secured as they have more privileges over your docker daemon. You can use firewall in docker or make it rootless.

                    <span>vim (aka Vi IMproved) is a highly efficient text editor that has inspired other editors like it, most notably MacVim (which I will refer to as vim from here on) and gVim.
You see, I use a code editor called Vim, which is sort of like an operating system for writing code.  I know it might seem bizarre, but there&#x27;s a method to my madness:  Vim lets me write code very quickly and with very little effort. It&#x27;s a great way of working that I wake up excited to do every day.  

Vim is one of the most popular text editors, which is why you’re either using it or wondering why you should be using it. But if you’re not a programmer, why should you care?
It&#x27;s a matter of preference, but 
You don’t have to open vim to write code
If you’re like us, you don’t want to have to switch between your text editor and your terminal while you write your code.
You can use it over an SSH connection
This is a big plus. With a few commands you&#x27;re inanother computer and can edit right away
It works on all operating systems
Even the most obsecure operating systems support vim. Like some router with busybox installed
It&#x27;s completely controlled by key presses
You don&#x27;t need to use the mouse, vim is controlled by key presses. However if you like clicking around, there&#x27;s gvim.
Vim does have a steep learning curve, but you can practice vim on sites like vim.is</span>

This might seem very odd, but of course, docker will let you experience the CLI version for a linux, say Fedora / Ubuntu / Debian / Alpine. You can use these OS images to build your application. Or just experience it in the CLI.
Similar to docker, you can launch OS instance in environment provided by the cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP, MS Azure etc. Here also, you get access to the OS via the CLI only.

Although there are secret management tools native to each cloud provider, using these solutions lock you in with a specific cloud provider. Vault, on the other hand, is open source and portable.
In this article we’ll look at how HashiCorp’s Vault can help organizations manage their secrets and in turn enhance their cybersecurity posture. We’ll then set up Vault in dev mode on our machines and interact with it via its web UI and CLI. …</span>

It&#x27;s not so evident that the Accept header is an essential part of HTTP and especially REST communication.
Accept header, either I&#x27;m.
This short article will show how simple to add validation and matching to your HTTP router independently to the router and framework you use.
Accept header is a simple list of mime types (application/json, text/html, etc.) or wildcard rules (*/*, application/*, etc.) that a client supports.
Accept header, the client expects to respond with one of the matched mime types from the header.
This header also supports additional parameters that a client can provide per a mime type.
The main parameter is quality q, that defines order of rules to choose the best option for a client, for example: */*;q&#x3D;0.1, application/json; q&#x3D;1, application/xml; q&#x3D;0.8.…</span>

Here is where the magic happens with this process. When I’ve identified duplicated data and move it to a central location not only does my code become more consistent and simplified but it is also more maintainable.
It is true that I am often working in prototype code so it really doesn’t “matter” that I have some duplication going on. Or even that the code isn’t maintainable because it’s all a prototype right now anyway.

I like Pikaday. This is because it is framework independent and great browser compatibility (includes IE7!).
Pikaday - GitHub
But it can only select the date. And this time i want to choose the month.
For Chrome and Edge or some other browsers, I can use &quot;input type&#x3D;&quot;month&quot;&quot;.

input type&#x3D;&quot;month&quot; - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN
But because it can&#x27;t be used in all modern browsers, and I don&#x27;t like its selecting years design, I don&#x27;t want to use it.
Because I only could find month pickers for jQuery, React, and etc, I will try creating it.
In this sample, I don&#x27;t care about old browsers.

Angular Material (v12) Autocomplete module.
RxJS for action and data binding.
Angular in-memory-web-api for REST services (Refer to in-memory-web-api).
 

 

 




Let us now see how we go about it:
The front-end consists of an angular autocomplete module. The input event taps the user&#x27;s keystrokes and emits a new value into an action subject.

AutocompleteService class.

The action BehaviorSubject starts with an empty string. The action$ is an observable built out of this subject.

GET request. Since this is a higher-order observable (i.e., an observable returning an observable), we make use of one of the higher order functions like switchMap.

switchMap (and not other higher order functions like concatMap or mergeMap)? The reason is: switchMap unsubscribes from the previous observable once a new value is emitted by the parent observable.
What this means is - as soon as the user types in another letter or removes a letter, there is simply no need to subscribe and execute the rest call for the previous values. The user is only interested to see the results of the search according to his/her current input. And switchMap does this automatically, and thus gets rid of unwanted rest calls.
We can also get additional control on when to fire the rest service depending on the length of the user&#x27;s input. For example, in this demo, I fire the rest call only when the user has entered at least 2 characters. If not, then I return an observable of empty array (using of([])).
 


  
  
  Back to the Component:


We tap onto the above observable and use async pipe to subscribe to it. Since we are completely using observables, we can also use the OnPush change-detection-strategy.

Recently, I started a small Angular application that acts as an installer for a distributed API Gateway application. As part of our testing and quality engineering, we always inspect our web applications. However, we hadn’t done much with static code analysis. It was mostly security dynamic analysis over our client and server communication. Fortify is a product that we have used for this since the company that I work for owns it, and recently they added support for Typescript in their static code analysis. So this was a great opportunity to use it on our Angular project.
Fortify is a product of Micro Focus that allows security scans of applications. Many people are familiar with “WebInspect”, which some people use as a synonym for Fortify.

                    <span>The JS environment teems with libraries and frameworks. However, with diverse options comes confusion along the way. It is imperative to choose the correct form of technology that helps you achieve what you want and helps in achieving your aim. A wrong decision can eat your time and leave your project in shambles. 
Why Choose Angular For Web Development? Let us look into some of the reasons for choosing Angular for your next project and how it will impact your business.
Parented by Google
Fulfills the Requirements
Purposefully informative
Checks and balances
The first impression is the last
using Angular CLI. All the components have predefined styles which help in the fast delivery of the service. Angular Material documentation is replete with the necessary examples which are required.
Package in itself
SPAs
Module Based
Friendly user-experience
Concluding to the final question- is it still relevant given that it has been here for a decade Yes! Absolutely! It is up-to-date and quite efficient in helping you build modern products. It is supported, powered, and parented by Google, and that in itself makes Angular&#x27;s future bright. However, depending upon your project, the choice of the framework should be taken judiciously. The angular ecosystem is vast and continues to bring a lot to the table. The core team releases biannual versions, making it always excitable for the next updated version.</span>

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>
