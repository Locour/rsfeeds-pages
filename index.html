I am not going to enter in how to create a form in angular only i want to explain the interesting things.
I&#x27;m going to start with something very simple but could be doubs about this. 
The question is:  What happens when we use &lt;form #f&#x3D;&quot;ngForm&quot; ... ?
Someone could think that we&#x27;re referencing our form, this could be true, but in reality more things are happening behind the scenes.

                    <span>Hi all, in this article, we will discuss what canDeactivate means and how to have a custom confirmation modal implemented based on our app theme.
In Angular we get in build support for the routes we define to have implementation for canDeactivate guard which is how we can restrict the user from moving away from the view when some work is in progress on the current view. Example User is making an edit on his profile page and didn&#x27;t click on the save button so at that time if we have implemented the router guard for canDeactivate, the user will be asked for the confirmation.

                    <span>It&#x27;s common to be concerned about security vulnerabilities in frontend frameworks. While Angular is the most preferred frontend framework among the developers for developing single-page applications, there are still security threats that need due attention for protecting Angular apps. 
Keep these top 5 security best practices at hand when building Angular apps. 
To prevent the injection of scripts into DOM elements such as authentication details, social security numbers, web tokens, etc. 
To prevent these malfunctions, use the InnerHTML property to sanitizes all the data that shows in components. But one should bind it to use to keep Angular alert enough to sanitize malicious activity-related strings. This interprets data as HTML in its context and is sanitized.

                    <span>Custom validators in Angular’s reactive form library are one of the most powerful (and in my opinion overlooked) tools a developer has to create better form UI/UX. Custom validators aren’t just limited to a single control. It is easy to evaluate an entire group. This is great for comparing multiple controls. In this article I create a multi-control custom validator that validates two fields if their values match to show an example of what is possible.
As I mentioned in my previous article about custom validators, I like using them to both handle custom logic that the built-in validators don’t, and to be able to create the validation error messages in one spot. This makes custom validators powerful and very reusable.

Creating a multi-control custom validator is very similar to creating a s…</span>

                    <span>While I hope this is a rare occurrence, I&#x27;ve run into this a few times where I had to rollback Terraform state to a previous version in AWS S3. Why not just keep it in the newer version? Well, some of our CI/CD pipelines used an older version of Terraform (say 0.12), and while none of the resource states actually changed, our code would no longer run after a developer ran something locally on their computer with a newer version of Terraform (say 0.14). 
So! Here&#x27;s a simple example on how to rollback state. 
Note: you must have versioning enabled on the S3 bucket. If it isn&#x27;t, PLEASE do that for all places that Terraform State is stored :p
I&#x27;m going to set up this up completely fresh with a new remote state object in S3 with the following Terraform code:

                    <span>Lens is the most powerful IDE for those who need to deal with Kubernetes clusters on a daily basis. It allows you to manage your cluster and view important health metrics. A Kubecost and Lens integration allows you to also visualize Kubernetes costs directly in the Lens UI. With Lens and Kubecost you can view costs and spend efficiency by namespace, pod, deployment and more!
For most teams, it’s really difficult to understand the cost of Kubernetes workloads, even in a somewhat static multi-tenant environment. When concepts like autoscaling are introduced, it becomes far more complex. This creates many challenges, including unintentional overspending, poor visibility for business planning, and missing costly bugs/mistakes.

As a fresh-out-of-college noob, I was thrown onto tools with steep learning curves resulting in low productivity rates. I thought it was the way it worked and I had to pay my dues to get comfortable with the system. 
I have since come to understand that there are better processes. In the words of Britney, Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know that something wasn&#x27;t right here?

                    <span>Let&#x27;s start with some simple array functions, which are methods on the array object prototype. In this post we are looking at Array.prototype.map(), or more simply map.


The map method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element. It does this without mutating the original array.


When the callback is used, it is passed three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the map method was called.


Below is an example using the map method on the users array to return a new array containing only the names of the users as elements. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback…</span>

                    <span>What is Claudia.js?


Claudia.js is a tool designed to simplify deployment of Node.js projects to AWS Lambda and API Gateway. It automates deployment tasks so you don’t need to worry about introducing errors and configures everything the way you would expect it to be set up out of the box.
According to the official website, Claudia’s primary objective is to help JavaScript developers get started using Lambda microservices easily so they can “focus on solving important business problems instead of dealing with AWS deployment workflows.”
In this section, we’ll walk you through setting up an example Node.js and Express.js app to show Claudia.js in action.
Claudia.js is available on npm. The simplest way to use Claudia.js is to install it as a global utility:

npm install -g claudia


Install the Express.js app generator using npm:

npm install express-generator -g

express claudia-demo

cd claudia-demo

The Express.js app will be hosted by a Lambda function, so it needs a handler to send data between the app and the API Gateway. This is where Claudia.js comes in. Claudia uses aws-serverless-express to generate a helper function to interface between API Gateway requests and Express.js requests and responses.
Execute the command below in your project directory. If you have renamed your Express.js application module, replace app with the name of the main Express.js application module:
$ claudia generate-serverless-express-proxy --express-module
app

Your app is now ready to go live:

claudia create --handler lambda.handler \ 
   --deploy-proxy-api \ 
   --region us-east-1

                    <span>Helm is a Kubernetes package manager that helps you find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes. With Helm Charts, you can bundle Kubernetes deployments into a single package you can install by running a single command. At LOGIQ, we use Helm Charts on the regular. One of our most commonly used Helm Charts is logiq – the same Helm Chart we use for quick deployments of the LOGIQ observability platform for customers, prospects, and folks who’d love to know more about what we’re building. 
This article will explain how you can deploy your favorite Helm Chart on MicroK8s in under 5 minutes.

Perhaps the biggest advantage of building apps using jQuery Mobile is the speed at which the applications load. jQuery eliminates the need for device-specific languages, so developers can use standards such as JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.
As a lightweight framework, it’s based on the jQuery library and has a strong focus on compatibility, so it can be used for Android, Windows, Blackberry, and iOS apps.
React Native has the edge over other frameworks due to its declarative programming style and reusable components for user interfaces. In addit…</span>

Keymapping or Key binding is a process in which a user or a system can assign certain keys or commands to perform a particular task or commands. This can be quite useful in Vim as well as in other text editors to avoid some repetitive tasks and save time. In Vim this can be a great power to have for programmers as it can be really very flexible to set up for any programming language and it&#x27;s environment.
This is not a in-depth guide of Vim-keymappings, it is just a overview of how to make keymappings and make the workflow a bit easier, probably give some insights on the strength of Vim to easily integrate with terminal and perform tasks with shortcuts. 
In Vim, you can map a particular keystroke combination to trigger a command or any operation. You can also map a key in pla…</span>

                    <span>Some upcoming work is on the horizon which I need to work with something I&#x27;ve not had the pleasure before - Kafka.
I thought it best to try out Kafka on my own terms using technologies I&#x27;m comfortable with before going into the real world and breaking something in production. 
Two thoughts knocked around:
I wasn&#x27;t concerned with configuring Kafka itself
I wanted to use Node to communicate with Kafka
As I wasn&#x27;t too concerned with the configuration of Kafka itself I decided to use this handy blog post from baeldung.com where I was walked through the steps needed to get an instance of Kafka running locally via docker.

                    <span>Axios is our recommended JavaScript HTTP client. While we are opposed to unnecessary outside dependencies, Axios has several advantages over fetch():
Axios is isomorphic, fetch is not
Axios throws an error when a request fails
Automatic JSON and Form-Encoded Serialization and Parsing
Interceptors and instances
Another reason is that Axios has neat helper methods that allow you to set the request method, like GET or POST. For example, below is how you can send an HTTP GET request with Axios.
const axios &#x3D; require(&#x27;axios&#x27;);

const res &#x3D; await axios.get(&#x27;https://httpbin.org/get?answer&#x3D;42&#x27;);

res.data.args; // { answer: 42 }

Want to send a POST request? That&#x27;s easy, just change get() for post() and pass the request body as the 2nd parameter.
const res &#x3D; await axios.post(&#x27;https://httpbin.org/post&#x27;, { hello: &#x27;world&#x27; });

res.data.json; // { hello: &#x27;world&#x27; }

Axios as a Function


If you prefer the named parameters approach that fetch() uses, you can also set the request method by setting the method option as shown below.
let res &#x3D; await axios({
  method: &#x27;GET&#x27;,
  url: &#x27;https://httpbin.org/get?answer&#x3D;42&#x27;
});

res.data.args; // { answer: 42 }</span>

                    <span>What is Claudia.js?


Claudia.js is a tool designed to simplify deployment of Node.js projects to AWS Lambda and API Gateway. It automates deployment tasks so you don’t need to worry about introducing errors and configures everything the way you would expect it to be set up out of the box.
According to the official website, Claudia’s primary objective is to help JavaScript developers get started using Lambda microservices easily so they can “focus on solving important business problems instead of dealing with AWS deployment workflows.”
In this section, we’ll walk you through setting up an example Node.js and Express.js app to show Claudia.js in action.
Claudia.js is available on npm. The simplest way to use Claudia.js is to install it as a global utility:

npm install -g claudia


Install the Express.js app generator using npm:

npm install express-generator -g

express claudia-demo

cd claudia-demo

npm i


The Express.js app will be hosted by a Lambda function, so it needs a handler to send data between the app and the API Gateway. This is where Claudia.js comes in. Claudia uses aws-serverless-express to generate a helper function to interface between API Gateway requests and Express.js requests and responses.
Execute the command below in your project directory. If you have renamed your Express.js application module, replace app with the name of the main Express.js application module:
$ claudia generate-serverless-express-proxy --express-module
app

Your app is now ready to go live:

claudia create --handler lambda.handler \ 
   --deploy-proxy-api \ 
   --region us-east-1

Fiber is a web framework for Go similar to Mux. But it&#x27;s heavily inspired by Express and that makes it perfect to work with for node developers.
It is built on top of Fasthttp engine, here are some benchmarks. It also has quite a low memory allocation overhead. For example while writing this article it only took around only ~16mb of memory, which was amazing!
In this article let&#x27;s implement very simple mock api routes to get a feel of the Fiber framework
The code from the article is available in this repository
You can install go directly on your system by installing the binary from go docs https://golang.org/doc/install

                    <span>Using Eslint in your project is an easy way to reduce those low-value, subjective code style comments from your pull requests.
It will also prevent real bugs in typescript and javascript through static analysis.
I’ll explain why it’s so important to use ESLint on your application and I’ll describe the plugins I always add to every new NodeJs application.
I use ESLint on all my professional work to ensure consistency for the entire team and to make sure we’re writing somewhat standard typescript/javascript.
I also use it on all my personal projects because it’s like having an additional senior dev watching my back every time I commit code.
Here’s a list of the plugins I use on all my projects and I’ve added some additional notes about plugins I don’t find useful.

Rest assured it won&#x27;t be some scorching review, because we’re looking at Damn Vulnerable GraphQL Application where weaknesses are completely intentional and exploiting them is the whole point.
As for why it&#x27;s fairly obvious, as GraphQL continues to grow and become more popular so too do the concerns about its vulnerabilities. After all, if you want to use it for your app you probably want it to be secure. So yes Damn Vulnerable GraphQL Application is full of weaknesses by design, it&#x27;s meant to test GraphQL’s safety against various attacks. Let’s look at these types of attacks (or scenarios) you can try out:

                    <span>It&#x27;s common to be concerned about security vulnerabilities in frontend frameworks. While Angular is the most preferred frontend framework among the developers for developing single-page applications, there are still security threats that need due attention for protecting Angular apps. 
Keep these top 5 security best practices at hand when building Angular apps. 
To prevent the injection of scripts into DOM elements such as authentication details, social security numbers, web tokens, etc. 
To prevent these malfunctions, use the InnerHTML property to sanitizes all the data that shows in components.

Autenticação faz parte de um processo de segurança. No caso de uma aplicação, o famoso &quot;login&quot; é uma forma de autenticação.
Existem inúmeras maneiras de um usuário realizar o login em alguma aplicação, mas aqui o foco é introduzir como funciona a autenticação de maneira bem breve e entender alguns conceitos de segurança da informação.
Entendendo o IAAA


Entrando mais no quesito fundamental de segurança, a sigla IAAA vem de identification, authentication, authorization e accounting, que em português significa identificação, autenticação, autorização e auditoria. 
Ter em mente esses 4 conceitos é bem importante para entender o processo de autenticação.

The bulk of the project is based on the blog-starter-typescript example in the NextJs GitHub repo.

The example code for these function is located in their lib folder as api.ts and markdownToHtml.ts. 
The system they used works very well, however, if you plan on creating many posts and incorporating many images then that is when the system begins to breakdown. Since you store all of the markdown files and images in your root directory then it will perpetually grow and hosting costs for packages that large are affected.

There are webpack plugins to also compile, minify, shim, chunk, and bundle code. However, webpack was not designed to execute tasks such as linting, building, or testing your app. For this purpose, there are task runners such as Grunt, Gulp or npx.
In order to manage the functionality of webpack, it must be configured. Here are six different ways, in which webpack&#x27;s configuration can be written.

                    <span>In case you ever wondered how to integrate Fastify with Next.js and let latter be a part of Fastify&#x27;s lifecycle this short guide is for you.
As you may know, Next.js has limited public API that does not provide anything that would return response as string or object. Moreover, Next.js writes response directly to stream that is being sent to the client.
What if we want to maintain session and attach or detach cookies that are being handled with Fastify when serving Next.js content?
Node.Js Proxy to the resque!
Let&#x27;s write a simple plugin that will wrap  http.IncomingMessage and http.ServerResponse and forward necessary calls to Fastify.

                    <span>Currently, the React+Typescript is considered as one of the most popular bundles for creating client-side applications. This combination has a huge potential and allows to develop solutions of any complexity. In this article, we’ll see why Typescript is so hyped, discuss some basic examples of working with components, storages, and API queries, and see the benefits of Typescript.

                    <span>Prerequisites to implement Error boundaries in React



Understanding of error types such as run-time, and compile-time errors.
Knowledge of Class based components.
An sentry account for logging errors
Architectural design pattern for implementing error boundaries in react.
Implementation of error boundary from scratch.
Types of errors catched by error boundaries.
Common problems faced during the usage of react error boundary.
react-error-boundary to the rescue.
Implementation of third-party error logging tools such as sentry.
In react, all the error boundaries are made up of class based components.
Error boundaries are some of the graceful ways using which you can catch errors in a more efficient way.
You can consider it as a try and catch blocks of JSX ecosystem.

                    <span>Monoliths have their place in many systems. Usually they stem from ease of use, allowing cross cutting changes to be done in a single pull request. They also have a lot of downsides, but that’s a whole other can of worms.
Here are the main points we had trouble with in our monolith:
How do you share code between sub-projects?
How do you manage typescript compilation for dependant projects? E.g. if a depends on b and I make a change to a, I want b to be compiled as well with the latest version of a.
This was an example of my repository structure:
projectA/
projectB/
projectC/
packages/

Inside my packages/ directory I had some core shared libraries, like types / shared utils etc.
Ok — so how do you get it all to work together?

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)

UI blocking is a thing of the past!

If you are building an application where you do a lot of calculations on UI, such as creating CAD documents, doing heavy geometrical calculations, or heavy data table manipulations, then you might have observed that the UI sometimes becomes laggy or janky.
This happens because JavaScript is not the only thing that runs on the main thread, but other things like the painting of pixels, style calculations, and many others also run on it. When we run heavy long-running JavaScript on the browser, occasionally we see that frames are missed, which does not provide a great User Experience.

                    <span>Hello Developers! All we are using either Axios OR fetch to communicate/exchange data with server. Both works perfect as per your requirement. Today we will go in detail and see how they are differ in terms of features they provide.
Axios — has url in request object
axios
  .get(url, {
    headers: {
      &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;,
    },
    timeout: 1000 * 60,
  })
  .then(res &#x3D;&gt; {

  })
  .catch(err &#x3D;&gt; {

  })

Fetch — has no url in request object.
 fetch(url)
  .then((response) &#x3D;&gt; response.json())
  .then((json) &#x3D;&gt; {  

  })
  .catch(() &#x3D;&gt; {

  })

Axios — third-party package that you need to install manually. 85.3k Star in Github — Well managed &amp; rich features library.

                    <span>Deploying a Kubernetes cluster is a time consuming and boring job so I created a project for solving this issue.
Here is the project: https://github.com/ridvanaltun/kubernetes-vagrant
Just follow the below steps:
# Install the plugin for Vagrant to ability to use environment files.
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-env

# Clone the project.
$ git clone https://github.com/ridvanaltun/kubernetes-vagrant.git 

# Go into it.
$ cd kubernetes-vagrant

# Don&#x27;t forget to customize your own environment file.
$ cp .env.example .env

# Up one master and two worker node.
# This takes approximately ~15 minutes if you using first time.
$ vagrant up m n1 n2

# Connect to master node over SSH.
$ vagrant ssh m

# You can do everything you want, an example, list nodes.
$ kubectl get nodes

It is simple like that.</span>

                    <span>Introduction


You can use cloud storage for on-premises data backups to reduce infrastructure and administration costs. There is several ways to backup your on-premise infrastructure to cloud, here I’ll use hybrid cloud (part of your infrastructure is on the cloud and part of your infrastructure is on the on-premise) to accomplish it. In this post I’ll show AWS Storage Gateway solutions to bridge between on-premise data to cloud. The common use case is disaster recovery, backup &amp; restore and tiered storage.
There is 3 types of Storage Gateway:

Before show how I implemented it, I’ll show a brief overview about each one.
Databases and applications are often backed up directly to a file server on-premises. You can now simply point these backups to the File Gateway, which copies the data to …</span>

                    <span>SCP comes in handy to copy files to a remote server from a computer or vice versa. You can also copy server files to another server.
All you need is your server’s IP address and user credentials to start copying. Here are some common SCP commands use cases.
scp file.zip user@hostip:/home/directory

This command will copy file.zip in your terminals present working directory to the home directory of the server.
scp user@hostip:/home/directory/file.zip ~/Downloads

You are copying file.zip from the server’s home directory to your local downloads folder.
Another use case of the SCP command is during site migration to a new server. Zip your site’s root directory and copy it to the new server.
Provide login credentials and file paths of both servers to SCP in your computer’s terminal.
scp user@remotehost1:/home/file.zip user@remotehost2:/home

Add -p flag to add port of remote host
scp -p 1122 file.zip user@hostip:/home/directory

Add a -C flag to enable the gzip compression in SSH transfer
scp -C localfile.zip user@hostip:/home/directory

-v Verbose SCP operation
-p 
 Mention remote host port
-P Save the file’s modification and access times
-r Copy recursively
-c  Specify the cipher for data encryption
So if you are still using an FTP client, use the SCP command in the terminal for a secure transfer.</span>

                    <span>Developers are always looking for simpler ways to do more advanced things in less time, and one of the many ways that they can achieve this is by using a selection of tools to supplement their workflow. The aim of this article is to cover some of the major tools that people use, and to give you an insight into what they can do to make your life easier.
And to seal the deal, all the tools I’ll be mentioning are completely free to use, which is an incredible price for what you’re getting from them.
Git / Version Control
Git is the most well-known version control tool out there. It allows you to store your code on a server (thereby reducing data-loss risks), collaborate with other developers and share your code online. Another huge plus to Git is that it allows you to go and look at other people’s public repositories, and see how they solved certain problems. This can then help you solve the problem in your application, and it can save you lots of time and effort.
Git is open-source itself and it comes with a huge selection of extensions that allow you to modify the functionality of the system in a huge range of different ways.
The fact that Git allows you to go back and review previous versions of your code, see how it’s changed and keep track of issues as well as provide you with lots of automation tools makes it quite clear that Git, or a Git alternative is a must-have for nearly every project.
Whilst you could install a system like Gitea on a VPS and then run your own Git server, there is a selection of different services out there that provide Git repository hosting as a service. These services often come with lots of extras too, and usually a very generous free tier. The most notable Git host out there is definitely GitHub, but it is closely rivalled by GitLab among other solutions.

Parrot OS is a light Linux distribution based on Debian. Microsoft SQL Server or SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. Starting with SQL Server 2017, Microsoft added Linux support and thus making any newer versions cross platform.
This post steps through the process of SQL Server 2019 Developer edition installation on Parrot OS and contains the following topics:
downloading and configuring MS SQL Server 2019 package repository
running the SQL Server setup process
installation of SQL Server command line tools
installation Azure Data Studio
running queries in Azure Data Studio
The commands used in this post will also work on any Debian based distribution like Ubuntu, MX Linux, Linux Mint, Knoppix among many others.

Hello 👋, Beautiful Coders on the internet 😃. In this article, I would share with you a quick yet comprehensive overview of how the most popular and widely used programming language in the world evolved to be what it is today.
Over the years JavaScript has become the most popular and versatile programming language. Powering over 97% of the web. As a web developer knowing the history of the most popular and in-demand programming language is a plus that will help enhance your understanding of the language.
Back in May 1995, the internet was becoming popular. The web back then was just static pages that were often text-heavy and ugly 😌.
the best ones had images floated to the left or right. Not exciting when you compare it to the web today 🤔

                    <span>Of the many platforms that have seen a surge in use over the past year, privacy-focused chat app Telegram is among the most successful. In April 2020, Telegram announced it hit 400 million monthly users. It now plans to reach a billion by 2022.
If you&#x27;re a privacy advocate, beginner developer, or simply like chatting with your friends, creating Telegram chatbots is a great way to practice coding and build something cool. The platform is only getting more popular, so knowledge of the Telegram API is a great skill to have!
In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll build a simple chatbot in Telegram using NodeJS and Replit. It will send selected memes from our group chat back to an instance of Sanity studio, where we can save them and publish them to a blog.

You&#x27;re already storing structured data in the database, it seems only logical to store files in there as well.
So you look up how to save files in MongoDB (or PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.), only to find out that storing files in the database is considered bad practice.
Other web developers are saying that you shouldn&#x27;t store files in the database, and they&#x27;ll frown upon you if you ask them how to.
But nobody tells you why...
Is it because it looks bad to have a very long base64 string in the database?
There has to be more to it than that.
By the end of this article, you&#x27;ll find out why saving files in the database is considered a bad practice.

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) has been shown capable of blocking up to 99.9% of brute force attacks. Yet a recent IBM/Ponemon Institute study found that only 36% of responding organizations require it. And adoption numbers for the general public aren’t encouraging either, with a report from LastPass finding that only 37% of respondents use MFA for their work accounts. When you add the finding by Verizon that 80% of data breaches involves the use of stolen credentials, these numbers beg the question, why?
If MFA has been proven so effective as a defense against data theft and brute force attacks, why are adoption numbers still so low? A common set of issues revol…</span>

Benefits of AWS Security Hub:
Security Hub reduces the effort to collect and prioritize security findings across accounts from integrated AWS services and AWS partner products.

Security Hub processes finding data using a standard finding format, which eliminates the need to manage findings data from multiple formats.

Security Hub then correlates findings across providers to prioritize the most important ones.

Automatic security checks against best practices and standards
Security Hub automatically runs continuous, account-level configuration and security checks based on AWS best practices and industry standards.

Security Hub provides the result of these checks as a readiness score, and identifies specific accounts and resources that require attention.

  First impression


I didn&#x27;t have a good first impression about Relay when I&#x27;ve started using it. I found it difficult to understand, verbose to use, and I didn&#x27;t saw the benefits from it.
Even though I didn&#x27;t like it, I was part of a team, and as a team we choose to stick with Relay and see in the long term if it was a good choice or not.
As the time goes by, I&#x27;ve started to get along with it and to understand how to use it. I still didn&#x27;t have the full idea, but just to realize how I could use it to solve simple problems like data fetching, and to know what I was doing was enough for me at the time.
Months later, I was promoted to tech lead and with that came the responsibility to understand and to explain to my team why we&#x27;re using the stuff that we&#x27;re using. I ha…</span>

Perhaps it is this familiarity with data that makes employees feel so connected to it when they change jobs. Even they often take some of it with them. Perhaps that is why most of them do not consider this a criminal act.
Whatever the reasons for this deliberate filtering of data; lack of security can affect the growth of an organization and its ability to maintain a competitive advantage. But with greater visibility into internal threats, organizations can expel bad players and improve overall security.

We might face the situation where we have to navigate the file system through a terminal or cmd because of lack of GUI  feature in the system like Servers. So it is must to know the basics of cd command.
cd command means Change Directory which is kind of self explanatory term. Now before jumping into the examples there is something we should know i.e, Paths in file system.
There are two types of paths in any operating system. 
Absolute Path
Relative Path
Absolute path is nothing but a path given from the root of the file system.
/home/user/Desktop/someDirectory

This is an example of absolute path because we have to provide the path from the bottom most part of the file system heirarchy.
In Relative path we don&#x27;t have to give whole location of the…</span>

  Recap


This tutorial is a follow up to the first tutorial found here on dev.to or on github on the to-do-list branch, where we built a to-do list generator using React and Fluree. If you are not familiar with Fluree, please refer to the first part of this tutorial series to learn the basics.
To get started git clone the repo via git clone https://github.com/fluree/version-2-lists-generator.git, or any other preferred method.


cd into the repo and run npm install


then run npm start to locally serve the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000

EDITOR’S NOTE: Crypto (digital currency) is becoming more mainstream with crypto exchange Coinbase’s IPO splash and the creation of the cyber yuan. Permission.io’s business model uses Auth0 to protect its platform while delivering digital currency in exchange for permission-based advertising. We invited their CTO, Hunter Jensen, to pen a post to share his thoughts on crypto’s future.
Today crypto is highly volatile — investing can be a real roller coaster. But that’s changing. We just saw the first public valuation of a cryptocurrency company, with Coinbase coming in at $86 billion. Governments are creating digital currency or at least talking about it. Here’s why I think e…</span>

This article reviews exactly what happened, how attackers gained access, how they used sensitive information and of course, what to do if you were affected. 
This breach was done by very sophisticated attackers who exploited a mistake in how Codecov built docker images. They used this to modify a script which allowed them to send the environment variables from the CI of Codecov customers to a remote server. While the attackers could have conducted multiple attacks from there, we can see based on other disclosures that one path they did take was accessing private git repositories from the git credentials in the CI environment, then exploiting secrets an…</span>

Throughout my career as a developer I have heard a lot of people agree that testing our code is something that we should all be doing. Conversely, I have not worked at many places that actually do it. Additionally, and surprisingly to me, rarely if ever do you see a tutorial show any kind of testing when they&#x27;re trying to teach something unless they&#x27;re specifically teaching testing.
While I understand that the focus of the lesson may not be testing, I think that if we really want to see testing adopted more widely across our industry then we…</span>

                    <span>&quot;Magic is just science that we do not understand yet&quot; 
This article is part of what I call the magical directives series. In this series, we will unravel the mystery behind some interesting Angular directives. Afterwards, we can add this little magic to our tool box. I call them magical directives because they play a very important role in building reusable components across our Angular applications.
Below are the directives that we will be looking at in this series.

The ng-container is a grouping element that does not introduce a new element in the DOM when used in our template. This means that it does not interfere with the layout and style of your applicati…</span>

                    <span>This article outlines my migration from Arch Linux to Debian. The details about the migration are spanned across a few videos, but below is a reasonably short summary.
I moved back from macOS to Linux and I&#x27;m loving it!
Mohammed Ismail Ansari ・ Mar 18 ・ 2 min read
#linux
        #macos
        #setup
      
Arch gave me a fresh new direction to explore and experience Linux the way I never did before. I created a couple of reusable artifacts and it in a way became a base for my second YouTube channel.
Things kept breaking, and I found myself spending more time on fixing things than I expected, even with my prior experience with Linux before I spent four years on macOS.




So I started looking out for alternatives and found the exact thing I was looking for.
I couldn&#x27;t lose the control I had over my Linux setup back with Arch by delegating it to a graphical installer. So I installed Debian in the way we usually do install Arch.




All this learning had to be documented somewhere so I created another video talking about the process in a little bit of detail.
Moving to Debian meant re-setting up the entire machine, even deeper than what I had to do back when I moved the factory-installed Windows to a smaller partition to make space for my primary Linux partition.




The new setup took away a few issues I never got fixed, and in exchange, brought with it a few other ones. I talked about the similarities, differences, negatives, and most importantly, the positives of the migration in a separate video, adding another episode to my series Back to Linux.
As I did last time, I&#x27;ll keep my eyes open for ways to improve my setup and workflow, and will keep documenting my learning to be able to share them with the rest of the community.
Needless to say, I&#x27;m loving the alternate universe with Debian. Do throw in your ideas and thoughts in the comments and hopefully, we can learn something from each other.</span>

                    <span>Hi, I want to write about some technical discussion about system designs, architecture designs, programming techniques and how to deal with troubles in real-world but I&#x27;ve found that it is very difficult to just explain topics via multiple arbitrary and unconnected examples. I&#x27;ve got some topics in my mind but I cannot convey them into words. My writing is not good enough. So I&#x27;m thinking of implementing some real product while writing about it at a same time. I can post all the design considerations here and will receive feedbacks which will help me (and maybe other people) a lot.
The problem is that I cannot think of any ideas about software/applications that are not only practical but also useful for real-life use cases. Simple case studies are good but I&#x27;m afraid of that the readers will lose the interest. So any suggestion would be welcome and appreciate.
Thank you very much.</span>

                    <span>While web builders have been around for a long time, it wasn’t until recently that they became practical for professional use. Closing the gap between design and code has become the north star for many companies and we are seeing a wave of tools that deliver on this promise.</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>
