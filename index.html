                    <span>Angular - Testes Unitários


No post anterior falamos sobre o básico de testes, neste iremos iniciar os testes unitários das estruturas do Angular.
Estruturas que iremos testar:
Pipes
Services
Como mostrado no post anterior os testes de Pipes não tem segredo.
Sempre que possível, é interessante testar todas as possíveis variações dos valores de entrada (limites do domínio de entrada) para que não tenhamos nenhum caso não tratato, pois não saberemos quem poderá utilizar nossa Pipe.

                    <span>Step 1. First we need to import Title service -
import {Title} from &quot;@angular/platform-browser&quot;;

Step 2. Using setTitle -
 constructor( private title: Title) {
 this.title.setTitle(&#x27;page title changed&#x27;);
 }

All together -
import {Title} from &quot;@angular/platform-browser&quot;;
@Component({
 selector: &#x27;app&#x27;,
 templateUrl: &#x27;./app.component.html&#x27;,
 providers : [Title]
})
export class AppComponent implements {

The Coursera SRE programmes shifts on to discussing system complexity and the introduction of the initial Service Level Indicators. Google recommend that around 1 to a maximum of 3 SLI&#x27;s per user journey should be enough.
Thoughts behind limiting the number to a maximum of 3 SLI&#x27;s:
Not all metrics make could SLIs
Each SLI increases the cognitive load on the operations team
More SLIs lower the signal-to-noise ratio (which can impact resolution time)
You may also have lots of user journey&#x27;…</span>

                    <span>Understanding Kubernetes can be difficult or time-consuming. In order to spread knowledges about Cloud technologies I started to create sketchnotes about Kubernetes. I think it could be a good way, more visual, to explain Kubernetes (and others technologies).
We continue the serie of Sketchnotes about Kubernetes, with some useful tools to know.


If you are interested, I published all the sketchnotes on Kubernetes (and new ones!) to make a &quot;book&quot; of 165 pages: &quot;Understanding Kubernetes in a visual way&quot;.

It means never attempt to restart the container if it stops or crashes. 
restart: &#x27;no&#x27; in our docker-compose.yml file. 
Remember to give single quotes &#x27;no&#x27; because in yaml file, if we give no without quotes, it is treated as false.

  Introduction


You may not have ever handled file uploads in React or any other technologies, but there is a high possibility you’ll encounter the need for it, whether tor update profile photos of users, CSV files, or PDFs, to mention but a few. In this guide, you’ll learn how to upload files in your React apps(Frontend) to NodeJs(Backend).
To get started, run the following command in your terminal or visit React to get a fully config…</span>

                    <span>Bit is a tool where you can upload components to the cloud ☁️ 🌈 so you can use them in other codebases, or import them to several files in one codebase. With Bit&#x27;s built in version control uploading and editing components across several codebases and machines is easily manageable. 
Although I love Bit, I experienced a learning curve with the commands. As a result here&#x27;s an explanation of my most used Bit commands as a library metaphor.

This isn&#x27;t anything new, I&#x27;ve seen others try to do this before, but the thing that bothers me is that they use an actual shell to execute the commands. They have their methods to sanitize inputs and whatnot but it still bothers me. For that particular case…</span>

I know that there are already such boilerplates, however, they are simply much too large and extensive for most purposes.

Hello everybody! Welcome to this Introduction to Git and GitHub video series, where you will learn the basics of Git and start using it for your day-to-day tasks.

                    <span>Vim is a powerful text editor used by programmers and system administrators as a command line interface. Vim is widely used by Linux users. It is also available in Windows, Mac OS X and every other Unix system.
The reason why it is that popular is that vim allows the programmer to code efficiently without leaving the editor. When coding, you don&#x27;t need to use your mouse. This sounds simple, but this is exactly what any programmer wants from an editor.
Most of its commands are robust and cryptic enough to be…</span>

I rarely post here but today I decided to ask the community about some tooling.
One thing that I find daunting in today&#x27;s web dev ecosystem is how to keep track of dependencies and plugin versions in all layers of our apps and, say, not miss a lot of versions for one tool or the other.
For example, in the project I&#x27;m working on, we have a front-end app made with React, a Java/Spring Boot back-end, a Keycloak authentication system, and so on.

The -g -O2 combination is valid and enables one to to debug the optimized executable. However the compiler will have generated a lot of optimizations, which will make it more difficult to step through the code. Using -g with no optim…</span>

                    <span>Today, when you use React and functional components, you need hooks.
Work with hooks is easier than lifecycle methods in class components, but I&#x27;ve encountered some issues and today, I want to share my solutions with you.
I like to cut my code in small pieces for a better understanding. I make four blocks in reading&#x27;s order. Usually, I use the same layout between functional and class components. In this article, I will only get into functional components.
The first block is for all the hooks and variables. …</span>

TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It introduces additional features like strict type binding (variables are bound to specific data types) to JavaScript and can also be compiled down to JavaScript as well.
TypeScript is an Open Source Project, and the source code for it is available on GitHub.

Quick answer:
Longer answer:
Higher Order Functions. It is an application of JavaScript&#x27;s ability to return functions from other functions.
We are replacing a function that takes n arguments with a set of n functions, which applied one by one gives exactly the same answer as original functions.
We can learn it by example right away. Btw it feels like this one is the most common one.
