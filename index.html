  Key Concepts


I don&#x27;t intend to leave behind the many developers that are just getting started. So, here&#x27;s the general breakdown that you HAVE TO know.
Container is just as it sounds, a box to separate out resources used by it. This is somewhere between running apps directly in your host vs running in a VM (Virtual Machine). In a VM only the hardware resources are shared. However, in docker the OS kernel is shared. This does mean that the security of your container can be compromised if you let it (That&#x27;s a whole another beast of its own, so I&#x27;ll leave that out. Yes, this does mean you should not just pull down some random image and run exactly as the writer tells you to 😭…</span>

Open your terminal


Type makecert as shown above.


Enter the PEM pass phrase or enter the password. Enter a password that is easy to remember because in the next step we are asked to enter a verification password.


Verify the password or type the password again as in step 3.


Type as shown above. If there is a command other than the picture above, you can just ENTER.



Enter the password again as was done in numbers 3 and 4.


Configure the file by going to C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra

                    <span>I made a library to generate development infrastructure for typescript project.
chore-cli is the super assistant for building a typescript library. It can generate development infrastructure for projects or libraries, such as prettier, eslint, husky etc, or even Github Actions Config files. It can save a lot of time every time you create new stuff.
As we know, These tools like eslint, prettier can make the codebase better. But it takes us a lot of time to configure them. If you don&#x27;t want your enthusiasm for writing code to be consumed by these configurations, and if you don&#x27;t like doing these annoying &quot;chores&quot; frequently, try chore-cli.
It&#x27;s easy to use：
npx chore-cli 


Take a look at the README.md for examples and further documentation, and let me know if you find any bugs, or you have any idea for improving it.</span>

Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
If you want to know more about Infrastructure as Code and and when to use different IaC tools take a look at this article of mine.
What is Infrastructure-as-Code and how is Terraform, CDK Ansible different?
 
The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation.


It offers a high-level object-oriented abstraction to define AWS resources imperatively using the power of modern programming languages. Using the CDK&#x27;s library of infrastructure …</span>

So much time people need to calculate percentiles in statistics. This is a little as R failed to have no inbuilt function for that like quantiles and mean.
So how do we go about this?? Well some people accept the we should use the general formula
Well, there is inbuilt function in R to do that but only few people aware of that. 
quartile() function. inside it includes parameters called &#x27;prob&#x27; and equal to your percentiles.
quantile(data, percentage)
Let say I need to find the 20 percentiles of the following data.

When writing IaC scripts using other tools, you usually have to use a DSL (like HCL in case of Terraform) of that tool or YAML or JSON which is a format that many tools use. 
Problem with YAML or JSON: 
But what if we need to add some logic in there, like
conditionals, &quot;create this EC2 instance, if xyz&quot;
or use loops, like &quot;I want to create 20 EC2 Instances with the same configuration&quot;
or what about re-using logic? Like, &quot;all 20 instances with this shared config, plus some specific configs&quot;
It gets pretty complex in such formats. So all these logical operations, loops, reusing blocks of code is a natural …</span>

                    <span>Welcome back to my another article. Here I will share you an idea how you can train &amp; deploy your machine learning model inside docker container. So let&#x27;s jumped directly on the installation part of it.
For installing docker, I&#x27;m using AWS instance but you can use any OS according to your desire. So if you&#x27;re also going the same then just launch your instance and follow the mentioned steps.
Note : If you are going to use RHEL8 then you have to run below script because RHEL8 doesn&#x27;t contain docker software by default But for other one you can skip it.
cat &gt; /etc/yum.repos.d/docker.repo
[docker]
baseurl&#x3D;https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/
gpgcheck&#x3D;0
EOF

Now you can move ahead towards the installing so run the below command.
yum install docker -y

In case of RHEL…</span>

KubeView is a simple Web interface that provides the complete overview of the Kubernetes Objects across namespaces and how they are interconnected to each other with intuitive UI &amp; icons.
Deployments
ReplicaSets / StatefulSets / DaemonSets
Pods
Services
Ingresses
LoadBalancer IPs
PersistentVolumeClaims
Secrets

                    <span>Although the relatively low costs of outsourced software development attract many product owners, they often find it hard to distinguish between the different types of outsourcing. What is the difference between the three outsourcing types, and which one is better for your business? Read on to find out!
Let’s start by clarifying the definition of outsourcing. Outsourcing means hiring external talent for your business needs, such as freelancers, consultants, or augmented teams. Outsourcing software development is a proven, cost-effective approach for any organization trying to remain competitive.

In this part of my development blog I will describe the infrastructure I chose for the early development of my online persistent universe single/coop players space game, AGS9. I will try to describe the reasons for my choices and describe some technical stuff. This is what I&#x27;m going to implement next in my development process.
To ease deployment and not &quot;fiddle around&quot; with servers and infrastructure, I chose to run my game server under Heroku. Instead of choosing a real-time process that &quot;runs in the background all the time&quot; and calculates the next &quot;tick&quot; of the universe in some sort of gameloop, possibly using an ECS (Entity Component System) for tracking all the things that should be going on, I decided to go the old &quot;classical web-app&quot; way and have a relational database and a we…</span>

                    <span>Linux systems are powerful operating systems with endless possibilities. However, learning to use this amazing OS can be difficult if you’re new to the Linux world. 
You could spend days browsing through forums, copy/pasting code and never really knowing what’s going on or why it works. If you want to learn commands, I recommend this site.
My first tip is pretty basic, but very important. Before you can run any of these commands, you’ll need to start the terminal.
One way is to enter the terminal outside of the GUI. X11 or Wayland provides the graphical user interface on linux. You can switch to the terminal by pressing Alt+Ctrl+F1 to F12.
You can also start a graphical terminal. There are many variants like gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm, kitty and many others.

                    <span>Learn how to use the Linux command line to save time and run commands faster. If you use a Unix-based operating system, such as Linux or macOS, you’re probably familiar with the shell, also called the command line. 
The shell lets you interact with your system by entering commands that perform actions. When it comes to mastering the shell, there are a lot of possibilities for streamlining your work.

Linux shells are a thing of beauty. They are the command line interfaces that power servers, minicomputers, supercomputers, embedded systems - and they are one of the most powerful tools in a system administrator&#x27;s arsenal.
A lot of tech professionals use the command line to do their job.
Learning to use the Bash command line on a Linux-based operating system will change your life. It will save you hours of frustration and anger, level up your career, and improve your life in many other ways. If you want to practice the command line, I recommend this site
Servers
If you use a server or web server for your project, it most likely runs on Linux. You can connect to the server using ssh and control it using commands.
ssh user@ip

Then login and you can control it with commands.
Search files
The power of the command line lies in its ability to perform tasks faster than you could with an interface alone. For example, if you want to find out where a file is located on your hard drive, you can use Nautilus/Dolphin (or Finder on a Mac) to locate it or just type one command:
find /home -type f -name filename.txt

You can also use the fd command
&gt; fd netfl
Software/python/imdb-ratings/netflix-details.py

Navigate file system
You can navigate the file system with the cd and ls commands. ls shows you the files in the current directory. cd changes the directory.
Some commands include cd ~ go to home directory, cd dir enter directory, cd .. leave directory.
That&#x27;s all you need to navigate your file system. Here you can find a large list of commands for Linux.</span>

The command line is something that anybody can learn and enjoy using. It&#x27;s a special way of interacting with your computer, by typing short commands instead of clicking around in menus. 
Although it&#x27;s easy to use, the command line does take a little getting used to, because it&#x27;s very different from what most people are used to. 
On top of that, there are many different commands. It can take a long time to become an expert without training. You can use this site to boost your Linux skills.

                    <span>So you&#x27;ve learned React. You know, at least vaguely, what the virtual DOM is and are comfortable with using hooks including useState , useEffect and useRef. What is the logical next step? I think you&#x27;ll find the answer to this question within the question itself. 

Next is a framework built on top of React that purports to make the development process even more palatable. Personally, I enjoy working with React already, so I was surprised to find the extent to which Next delivers on its promise. 
What exactly makes learning Next a worthwhile endeavour? There&#x27;s a lot that sets Next apart from simply using React, but let&#x27;s start with 3 key features that Next implements to solve common React problems.

                    <span>Hello everyone👋
Before proceeding, I am assuming, you are aware of the request-response architecture of a basic web application. To build a real-time application like a chat application we can&#x27;t use the basic request-response architecture, but we can use it with a polling mechanism to achieve the real-time behaviour. Apart from the polling mechanism we also have SSE(server-side event) and WebSocket to achieve real-time behaviour.
In this article, I am going to discuss two types of polling techniques i.e, long polling and short polling.
First, we need to know, what is polling?
Polling is a technique in which the client sends a request to the server asking for data in an interval of time.
The response from the server can be empty or any kind of data.
Short Polling is a technique in which th…</span>

                    <span>⏳ Task scheduling allows you to schedule your code to be executed at a scheduled date/ time, at recurring intervals, or once after a specified interval. In Linux, this is often handled by packages like cron. In this article, I will show you top 4 task scheduling packages that emulate cron-like functionality for Node.js apps.
Node Cron


The node-cron module is tiny task scheduler in pure JavaScript for node.js based on GNU crontab. This module allows you to schedule task in node.js using full crontab syntax.

You can install node-cron by using npm.
$ npm install --save node-cron

var cron &#x3D; require(&#x27;node-cron&#x27;);

cron.schedule(&#x27;* * * * *&#x27;, () &#x3D;&gt; {

                    <span>What exactly is Deno?
Deno happens to be a runtime for TypeScript and JavaScript, based upon the Rust programming language and V8 JavaScript engine.
Key comparisons with NodeJS
The core of Deno has been created in Rust programming language in addition to Tokio. Nodejs was created in C++.

Typescript is a JavaScript superset aimed at getting rid of the development issues before the execution of the code.

Typescript is ideal for big applications.

ES6 imports Statements as dependency management.

An absence of npm, indicating that it doesn’t use any package manager such as npm and doesn’t come with package.json for handling modules.

Deno will be breaking on unhandled exceptions that are not the case with NodeJS.

Deno demands explicit permissions for network, file, and environment access.

Will Deno JS be able to replace NodeJS?
Given that Deno can be considered to be an improved alternative to node JS, it might replace node JS in the long run. Nevertheless, it will only be possible over a significant period mainly because a large community depends on node js. At least for the time being, Node js isn’t going anywhere; Deno is only considered a fancy alternate choice.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s take a closer look at what documents are and how they&#x27;re used to store data in a structured way.
A document is a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs.
Just like the below object, where the field is a unique identifier for some data point, and the value is data related to a given identifier.
{
  : ,
  : ,
 &quot;name&quot;  : &quot;Raju&quot;,
 &quot;title&quot; : &quot;Team Leader&quot;,
 &quot;age&quot;   : &quot;26&quot;
}

In this example, there is a field name, and the value is Raju.
We will look closer at documents and their structures once we get our hands on an actual data set.
But for now, this is a simple example of a document.
A collection would contain many documents similar to this one.
And a database would contain multiple collections.
In this post, I defined what document and collection mean in MongoDB.
In the next post, I will start querying collections for documents and interact with the database in general.</span>

                    <span>A database, meaning a structured way to store and access data. More specifically, it is a NoSQL database.
NoSQL is a very generic term used to describe any data store that doesn&#x27;t use legacy approach of related tables of data.
This means that you&#x27;re storing your data in an organized way, but not in rows and columns An example of NoSQL databases can be anything from a library card catalog, to a more sophisticated data store like MongoDB.
Since the range of what NoSQL means is so wide, we must narrow our definition further.
MongoDB is a NoSQL document database.
This means that data in MongoDB is stored as documents. I will cover what a document is in the next post.
These documents are in turn stored in what MongoDB call collections of documents.
That&#x27;s why MongoDB is categorized as a NoSQL document database.
In conclusion, the MongoDB database is a NoSQL document database.</span>

                    <span>The #1 tip to familiarize with new JavaScript Codebases


In my years as a software engineer, I have probably looked at hundreds of codebases. Too many to count. I struggled a lot with understanding where the relevant code is most of the time. Normally, asking for help what I should look for and guidance in tickets will bring me forward. Slowly and surely I will understand what the code is doing. And you will too. Some people are better at this and some people will be slow. No shame. Most code is complex. But I found a simple tool that will make it easier for you. It is called code-complexity and you can use it as the following code snippet shows:
npx code-complexity . --limit 20 --sort ratio
# You can also use --filter &#x27;**/*.js&#x27; to use glob patterns to filter files

Referrers on the web allow sites you are visiting to see what site you have come from, as the Referer header (it is actually mispelled in the HTTP Specification) contains a absolute or partial url of the site you&#x27;ve come from if you have followed a link.
commonly used for tracking and analytics, but it can also be used to steal information for example that contained in the URL of a reset password page or where a token is part of the URL, which is why it comes under security headers.

This is the third and final article in a series that guides you through the process of creating a “wishlist” mobile application using the Flutter SDK. The wishlist contains items that the user would like to someday own, storing each item’s name, description, and URL. The mobile app provides the user interface and communicates with a back-end application, which stores the list and provides an API to perform CRUD operations on it. The initial version of the app simply provides a functioning wishlist, while the final version incorporates Auth0 authentication to allow only authorized users to use the app as well as to use a secure API.

Vulnerabilities in billions of Wi-Fi devices let hackers bypass firewalls


It&#x27;s dubbed FragAttacks and it&#x27;s bad news.
Excerpt from the article:
FragAttacks allow data to be injected into Wi-Fi traffic, but they don’t make it possible to exfiltrate anything out. That means FragAttacks can’t be used to read passwords or other sensitive information the way a previous Wi-Fi attack of Vanhoef, called Krack, did.
But it turns out that the vulnerabilities—some that have been part of Wi-Fi since its release in 1997—can be exploited to inflict other kinds of damage, particularly if paired with other types of hacks.

                    <span>Many developers start with hard-coded config and secrets in either JSON or JavaScript files, and while this works, it poses a security risk as any developer with code access can potentially view secrets such as production database credentials and API keys.
If you&#x27;re currently configuring your applications like this, don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;re not alone! Most developers eventually realize that hard-coding credentials isn&#x27;t the way to go, and begin looking for a more secure alternative in the form of a secrets manager.
This is exactly we created Doppler—giving developers an easy to use secrets manager for Node.js applications that centralizes secrets storage with an easy to use CLI for injecting secrets as environment variables.
Environment variables are considered the best way to configure applica…</span>

                    <span>Infrastructure as Code


Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
If you want to know more about Infrastructure as Code and and when to use different IaC tools take a look at this article of mine.
What is Infrastructure-as-Code and how is Terraform, CDK Ansible different?
 
The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation.


It offers a high-level object-oriented abstraction to define AWS resources imperatively using the power of modern programming languages. Using the CDK&#x27;s library of infrastructure …</span>

Today we&#x27;re going to add physics to our HTML tags, just because it&#x27;s possible! And to learn a bit about web components and Matter.JS

A simulation with bouncy barrels, stubborn crates, platforms and a player character.
Example code is in Typescript, but you can leave out type annotations such as a:number and public, private to convert to Javascript.
A custom element is a HTML tag that has executable code added to it. That&#x27;s really handy for game objects! We&#x27;ll use that to add physics later. You can nest custom …</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve created a VSCode extension that makes complex types easier to read, and I&#x27;ll show you how to use it!
When I&#x27;m writing TypeScript, it sometimes hard-to-read complex types for me, so I often need to bind them to variables and use completion to find properties. I was wondering if there was something I could do to see the expanded types.
I found out about TypeScript&#x27;s CompilerAPI, so I thought it would be a good idea to extract the type and pass it to the VSCode Tree View, so I made it.
An extension that can expand TypeScript type definitions
You can install from ts-type-expand - Visual Studio Marketplace.

Like this, You can expand and check the hard-to-read types on VSCode as many times as you need.

                    <span>What exactly is Deno?
Deno happens to be a runtime for TypeScript and JavaScript, based upon the Rust programming language and V8 JavaScript engine.
Key comparisons with NodeJS
The core of Deno has been created in Rust programming language in addition to Tokio. Nodejs was created in C++.

Typescript is a JavaScript superset aimed at getting rid of the development issues before the execution of the code.

Typescript is ideal for big applications.

ES6 imports Statements as dependency management.

An absence of npm, indicating that it doesn’t use any package manager such as npm and doesn’t come with package.json for handling modules.

Deno will be breaking on unhandled exceptions that are not the case with NodeJS.

Deno demands explicit permissions for network, file, and environment access.

Will Deno JS be able to replace NodeJS?
Given that Deno can be considered to be an improved alternative to node JS, it might replace node JS in the long run. Nevertheless, it will only be possible over a significant period mainly because a large community depends on node js. At least for the time being, Node js isn’t going anywhere; Deno is only considered a fancy alternate choice.

You may not know it, but you need TypeScript or at least, you need to test it.
Let me be clear, I love JavaScript and the freedom it provides, for a long time I was &quot;against&quot; TypeScript.
So I want to go on a journey together, figuring out if TypeScript is worth using or TS is only for people who don&#x27;t know how to code properly (this was an inside joke in my team a time ago!).
The idea behind this article is to go through the basics of TS and understand the benefits so you can decide if you want those benefits or not, in a second part I will cover the specifics of TS with React.

FoalTS carefully selects ORMS and other libraries for their typescript support to build one of the more robust typescript backend engineering experiences.

                    <span>Intro


A cool trick in TypeScript is that you can use a Set to remove nonunique values from an array. Combine this with Array.from and you get a quick one liner to remove none unique values
const unqiueValues &#x3D; Array.from(new Set(YOUR_ARRAY_HERE))

// Our array of non unique values
const values &#x3D; [0,0,1,&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;b&#x27;,&#x27;c&#x27;];

// Create a &#x60;Set&#x60; from our array
// Sets can only contain unique values so duplicate will be removed for us
const uniqueSet &#x3D; new Set(values);

// Create a new array from our set so we can use the Array.length property
const unqiueValues &#x3D; Array.from(uniqueSet);

// Compare the length of the original &#x60;values&#x60; array and the new &#x60;uniqueValues&#x60; array
// If the lengths differ then a non unique value was removed by the set
// This means that the original array contained non-unique values
const isUnique &#x3D; (values.length &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; unqiueValues.length)

const values &#x3D; [0,0,1,&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;b&#x27;,&#x27;c&#x27;];
const unique &#x3D; (Array.from(new Set(values)).length &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; values.length);

onlyUnique(values: Array): boolean {
  return (Array.from(new Set(values)).length &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; values.length);
}

                    <span>No, upgrading to Angular 12.x.x will not help.
The Typescript experimental decorators were based on TC39 proposal-decorators.
We use the same Decorators in our Angular codebase to create services, components and other Angular constructs.
But the same TC39 proposal has evolved in a different direction which is semantically not compatible with the experimental Typescript decorators.   
The new spec for Decorators is easier to use and write.
You can find the detailed comparison between old and new decorators here. 
Just finished up the first draft of the new decorators spec, pretty excited about it 😄 https://t.co/ELhZbsiaiR

Does this mean that Typescript experimental decorators will not be compatible with Javascript decorators 😨
— Shivam (@shivamd20

Unfortunately no, the new proposal has differing semantics from previous proposals in a number of ways. TypeScript experimental decorators were also incompatible with the Define semantics class fields, which caused a decent amount of breakage in the ecosystem.

When the proposal advances, figuring out a step-by-step incremental upgrade path for existing decorators users is definitely going to be a priority though! No user left behind 😄

Let&#x27;s just hope that this doesn’t result in fragmentation of JavaScript decorators. We have already faced a lot inconvenience due to commonsjs and ES6 imports.</span>

I wanted to something fun for the holiday season, so I decided to port a variable-width stroke from the Flex Freehand Drawing Library I created back in the early 2010’s. This stroke actually has a venerable history, going back to about 1983, as an exercise I was assigned as a teaching assistant for a graduate course in computational geometry. The instructor’s company recently obtained a very expensive tablet. This system allowed users to scan or load drawings already in electronic form into a display and annotate them with hand-drawn notes using a fixed-width stroke. The instructor had an idea for a variable-width (speed-dependent) stroke that would be the basis for a number of lab exercises. My job was to get his idea working in Fortran (yes, now you ca…</span>

                    <span>⌨️ Improve the User Experience (UX) of an e-commerce application by implementing animations utilizing Angular animations, CSS animations, and Web Animation APIs.



  
  
  
Developers can use animations in meaningful and non-distracting ways to significantly improve their application&#x27;s user experience (UX). This blog post discusses four effective techniques to animate your application&#x27;s user interface, covering popular use cases. You&#x27;ll learn how to transform bland experiences into memorable ones for your users.
I created a demo application to help you focus on adding animations to Angular. You&#x27;ll add animations to a starter app as you progress through this tutorial. The starter application uses Tailwind to take care of its style and layout, but none of the animations discussed here are dependent on it.
Follow this tutorial without cloning any repo, right in the browser using Stackblitz or CodeSandbox.
If you prefer to work locally in your IDE, clone the demo app and check out its starter branch:
git clone -b starter git@github.com:auth0-blog/angular-animations-storefront.git

Once you clone the repo, make angular-animations-storefront your current directory:
cd angular-animations-storefront

Install the project&#x27;s dependencies:
npm i

Run the project locally:
npm run start

Angular comes with a powerful animation module that lets you quickly add motion to your application: BrowserAnimationsModule. Under the hood, this module uses the Web Animations API (WAAPI) to create motion and interactivity. Whenever WAAPI isn&#x27;t available, BrowserAnimationsModule falls back to using CSS keyframes. Angular animations give you the option to use their abstraction layer to animate any properties that the web considers animatable such as positions, sizes, colors, and many more.

Building a web application with Angular and Firebase presented by Mark Thompson. 
| Angular 12.0.1 | firebase 9.11.0 | Node 14.17 |
Taking Mark&#x27;s instruction a bit further; to achieve drag&amp;drop in a bit more realistic situation, calling the store in a service asynchronously. To achieve this status, I stumbled on the .valueChanges(...) method.
The internal firestore documents explains the working of this .valueChanges(...) method as it listen to all documents in the retrieved collection and queries this list as an Observable. 
idField. When the idField option is provided like 
.valueChanges({idField: &#x27;&lt;a-property-of-the-document&#x27;}) it means that the document ID (actually the document&#x27;s name) will be mapped to the provided property being one of the properties within the document-object.
Know the construction of the document, in this case document (ITask) &#x3D; { id?: string; title?:string; description?: string&#x27;; }. 

When calling the .valueChanges(...) method with a provided idField, which is set to one of the provided properties as stated, internally, the ID (actually the document&#x27;s name) of that document is mapped to the &#x27;provided&#x27;-property within the document object.

                    <span>No server, application, script or binary stuff is something isolated from the rest of the computer. Being aware of what is happening behind the scenes is useful, because lot of things can happen.
For this reason, Golang offers a simple way to manage this, without any black magic.
Lets suppose we have just a simple main function that starts a simple http server.
package main

func main{
    StartServer()
}


Maybe this works fine, but this is not aware of anything about the underlying OS. This means that, if something signals the main process to stop, this will just stop or crash without the possibility of gracefully shut down the server and it’s child gorutines.
Imagine now that we could pass a a context with cancellation this function as an argument like StartServer(ctx).

                    <span>These are some command line tools for Linux. All these tools have one thing in common, they all use the Linux Command Line Interface (CLI).
These tools are mainly useful for developers and sysadmins who use the linux shell on a daily basis.
If you are new to the command line, I recommend this course
Ranger is a console file manager for the X Window System / Wayland. It lets you browse your file system using just the cursor keys. It&#x27;s great for viewing images too, pressing the right arrow on an image shows it.

ncdu is a disk usage analyzer just like du. But ncdu has a unique approach to this problem of disk usage.
ncdu is a disk analyzer for the command line. It scans your home directory and shows you how much space each directory takes.
unlike du, it uses an ncurses interface.

Lynis is an open source security auditing tool that tests the security defenses of Unix-based systems. 
It scans the system locally or remotely and gives a detailed report on the system’s security, allowing you to well-informed decisions for system hardening.
Lynis is a security tool designed to test common system security. This includes controls, policies and procedures as well as the actual security mechanisms of the operating system itself. It helps you to answer those questions and gives you recommendations how to improve overall security of your systems.</span>

                    <span>This post provides useful links and an overview of best practice configuration for low latency storage IO by creating LVM Physical Extent (PE) stripes for database disks on InterSystems Data Platforms; InterSystems IRIS, Caché, and Ensemble. 
Consistent low latency storage is key to getting the best database application performance. For applications running on Linux, Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is often used for database disks, for example, because of the ability to grow volumes and filesystems or create snapshots for online backups. For database applications, the parallelism of writes using LVM PE striped logical volumes can also help increase performance for large sequential reads and writes by improving the efficiency of the data I/O.

                    <span>The following are my favorite tips and tricks for working with Vim. I use Vim as my primary editor, and try to avoid the use of other IDEs and editors.
If you&#x27;re new to vim, or looking to learn more about the features already available, here&#x27;s a sample of my tips and tricks.
Vim is often used by Linux but it works on every system. It&#x27;s included by default on Mac OS X.
If you type / then a search term, Vim will start searching forwards from the current cursor location for that word. 
To search for the next occurrence of that search term, press n (for next); to search backwards press N . After pressing n or N , Vim will highlight all matching words, which you can then press on to select.

One of the most powerful features of Vim is its ability to use ex commands. First, in order to run ex commands, you must be in insert mode: that is to say, not at the beginning of a line. 
It’s important to note that in order to enter insert mode, you must first exit normal mode. To do this, press “i” or “a” – these keys will start you off in insert mode at the beginning of a new line or at the end of your current line.
Now that you’re in insert mode, you can type “:” and then an ex command.
Some things you can do are:
:5p print the fifth line
:100p print line 100
:%s/hello/world/ search and replace
:!bash return to bash, type exit to open vim
This saves you quit a few keystrokes. Press the number of times you want to repeat, then press the key. To move 100 lines down, press 100j. To move up 50 lines, press 50k. To delete 5 lines press 5dd etc.

Vim supports keyboard macros. They let you record and replay your keystrokes. This is really great if you have some tedious typing to do.
To start recording press q followed by a. To stop recording press the ESC key. Then press @ followed by a to replay the keystrokes.
If you are new to vim, I recommend this course</span>

  Intro 


Continuing on from my previous blog about website security week, we&#x27;re going to talk about a series of X- security headers.
These are set as headers on your site when it is served up, let&#x27;s dive in!



This header indicates that the browser should not try and sniff the type of the file served up. Sniffing of the file type would mean the browser modifying the Content-Type header that is returned from the server.
Sniffing the file content type could lead to non executable files being made executable, this could lead to bad actors injecting executable code into normal files and could lead to vulnerabilities.
It&#x27;s best not to let the browser sniff the code.
Recommended setting:
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

You can read about it more on Modzilla.



This header has mostly been superseeded by the Content Security Policy, however its still useful for old browsers.
Recommended setting:
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode&#x3D;block

You can read about it more on Modzilla.



This header has mostly been superseeded by the Content Security Policy, however its still useful for old browsers.
This indicates if the site can be loaded in a , ,  or .
Recommended setting:
X-Frame-Options: DENY

You can read about it more on Modzilla.



In summary, setting a few additional headers when serving up your site can really improve the security of your site. It reduces the amount of attack surface there is for attackers and prevent common attacks on websites.
Set those headers now!
Happy Building!</span>

Everyone talks about creating content. But what about controlling it? In this Dogfooding Chronicle, I’ll walk you through how we updated our Content Security Policy using Discover — and how we’re keeping watch with Dashboards.
As the Internet evolves, so must our security mechanisms. It’s why same-origin policies (a Netscape-era directive in which resources from one origin are unable to modify or read data from another origin) put your application at risk for clickjacking and cross-site scripting attacks. That’s because same-origin policies have a weakness that enables third-party entities to have the same access rights as trusted entities. Content Security Policies (CSPs) address this blind spot by approving specific content types — everything from JavaScript sources to CSS…</span>

                    <span>Web push notifications are a way of informing your app users when something important has happened. 
Users can receive web push notifications even when they are not actively using your application, for instance, if the app is open in a background tab or even if it&#x27;s not open. 

Push notifications are widely supported by all browsers except for Safari: 78% of web users use a browser that supports them.
In this tutorial, I&#x27;ll show you how to subscribe to notifications in the browser and how to send notifications from a Java server. 





  
  
  A bit of background: how web push notifications work


Web push notifications rely on two web standards: Notification API and Push API (which in turn uses ServiceWorker). They require HTTPS to work. 
The server shares its public key with the browser

                    <span>No, upgrading to Angular 12.x.x will not help.
The Typescript experimental decorators were based on TC39 proposal-decorators.
We use the same Decorators in our Angular codebase to create services, components and other Angular constructs.
But the same TC39 proposal has evolved in a different direction which is semantically not compatible with the experimental Typescript decorators.   
The new spec for Decorators is easier to use and write.
You can find the detailed comparison between old and new decorators here. 
Just finished up the first draft of the new decorators spec, pretty excited about it 😄 https://t.co/ELhZbsiaiR

Does this mean that Typescript experimental decorators will not be compatible with Javascript decorators 😨
— Shivam (@shivamd20

Unfortunately no, the new proposal has differing semantics from previous proposals in a number of ways. TypeScript experimental decorators were also incompatible with the Define semantics class fields, which caused a decent amount of breakage in the ecosystem.

When the proposal advances, figuring out a step-by-step incremental upgrade path for existing decorators users is definitely going to be a priority though! No user left behind 😄

Let&#x27;s just hope that this doesn’t result in fragmentation of JavaScript decorators. We have already faced a lot inconvenience due to commonsjs and ES6 imports.</span>

Imagine a website with lots of components such as Navbar, Footer, Main Container and Side Menu. What would happen, if they were being served from different domains? Yes, you guessed it right we would&#x27;ve ended up with a micro Frontend. Now, thanks to micro frontend technologies, we can deal with those apps separately. We can write their unit tests separately, e2e tests separately we can even use different frameworks like Angular, Vue and Svelte.
There are two major players to make those things happen right now, one of them is Module Federation and another one is Single SPA which I covered here: 🔗Migrating CRA to Micro Frontends with Single SPA.

                    <span>Last month I setup my blog with Angular Universal (Server Side Render) this is about my steps installing SSR in my blog, so keep in mind a simple blog with only text with http request to contentful, so is real scenario, but the simple case to get start with Angular and Server Side render.
First step install Angular universal.
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine@next

Next step was set up the build in netlify
npm run build:ssr

The page is ready with server side render, but my client application need to request the articles, The TransferState service help to send information from the server to the client.
  imports: [
    BlogHeaderModule,
    BrowserModule,
    InfrastructureModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    BrowserModule.withServerTransition({ appId: &#x27;dw&#x27; }),
    TransferHttpCacheModule
  ],

Install it as part of the App module and import into  ServerTransferStateModule in server module.
@NgModule({
  imports: [AppModule, ServerModule, ServerTransferStateModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})

Done
Because my app is only text was easy to get more than 95% but keep in mind the following points.
Not all application are the same, my case is a simple blog, so not issues with images, or authentication.
Use https://contrastchecker.com/ and https://alex-page.github.io/sass-a11ycolor for accesibility issues.
If is your first time, try with an easy proyect like a blog or small app.
Take care about how to use or transfer data between components, I got an issue to send data using this.location.getState().

                    <span>A user is usually authenticated by entering a username, email address, and/or password and then being given access to various resources or services. By its very existence, authentication relies on maintaining the user&#x27;s state. This seems to go against HTTP&#x27;s fundamental property of being a stateless protocol.  
Your Angular app will communicate with a backend that generates tokens. The Angular app can then send the token to the backend as an Authorization header to show they&#x27;re authenticated. The JWT should be checked by the backend, and access should be granted based on its validity.

                    <span>Introduction


In this article, we will see some of the best practices to unsubscribe from subscriptions (aka Observables) and how to keep our code clean and nicely architectured avoiding memory leaks.
In a nutshell, we will use:
the async Angular build-in pipe
RxJS operators (e.g takeUntil)
custom array of subscriptions
the SubSink npm package
the @ngneat/until-destroy npm package
If you have experience in Angular, you already know that RxJS is one of the most powerful packages. It uses the concept of Observables to handle and work with asynchronous and event-based code. More specifically, Observable is an entity that emits multiple data values over time and asynchronously.
It sounds cool, right? Yes, it is cool and powerful, but you already know that!
What&#x27;s the problem with Observables …</span>

                    <span>In this digital era, the importance of customized web and mobile apps has increased significantly. But as competition intensifies, it is necessary for companies to come up with feature-rich apps to match world-class standards and attract more people. Therefore, if you want to develop an app from scratch, the website development company
needs to use a consistent software stack. All you need to have the right set of tools, resources, and a standardized development process to build a customized and user-friendly application.
MEAN stack is such a stack that can meet your business needs effectively while offering the benefits of advancing technology in customized web and mobile apps. MEAN acronym stands for MongoDB (a database), Express (backend framework), AngularJS (Front-end framework), and …</span>

I seek to change the code within systems...
but LO! The access blocks me here! Oh DAMN!
To be but free to do what can be done!
Systems of checks and balances adhere
but they prevent the hard, the real, the work!
Design, construct, create a new system.
One that values o&#x27;er bronze the brain within.
Real work is near... No fear, no fight! It&#x27;s here!
Adapt and change complex systems at work...
To be but simple... YES! No more matrix :P
Access granted. And now the change is here.
Today we start a new simple system.

                    <span>It&#x27;s been a while since I wrote for the last time, and partly it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve focusing on studying a new career path: Threat Hunting. Even though Yara is not an usual tool in my work routine I use it for my own researching, so I thought about breaking the ice with a simple tutorial on using Yara for looking for malware genes in binaries.
If you are slightly into malware analysis you probably know about Intezer. One of the things I like the most about that tool is the ability of analyzing genes, meaning it compares already known malware strings and Libraries in order to determine if a sample is similar enough (considering the percentage of similarities). Hash comparison lets you know if a binary is exactly the same as a malicious one, but genes comparison allows you to determine a probabl…</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
