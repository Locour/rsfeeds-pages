Get the SQL Server on Linux for Docker Engine image



I&#x27;m running Docker on MacOS, I will use the SQL Server on Linux for Docker Engine at Docker Hub
   docker pull microsoft/mssql-server-linux

Set the settings and start the container
SQL Server on Linux for Docker Engine requires an environment setting to accept the EULA and set a strong SA password:
   ACCEPT_EULA &#x3D; Y
   SA_PASSWORD &#x3D; 

Run this in the terminal:
   docker run -e &#x27;ACCEPT_EULA&#x3D;Y&#x27; -e &#x27;SA_PASSWORD&#x3D;yourStrong(!)Password&#x27; -p 1433:1433 -d microsoft/mssql-server-linux

Copy a backup to the container




   docker cp &#x27;/tmp/DatabaseName.bak&#x27; mssql-server-linux:/tmp

Restore the backup




   RESTORE DATABASE DatabaseName FROM DISK&#x3D;&#x27;/tmp/DatabaseName.bak&#x27;
   WITH MOVE &#x27;DatabaseName&#x27; TO &#x27;/var/opt/mssql/data/DatabaseName.MDF&#x27;,
   MOVE &#x27;DatabaseName_log&#x27; TO &#x27;/var/opt/mssql/data/DatabaseName_log.ldf&#x27;
   Go

Connect with a docker command or an IDE like DataGrip




Using SQL Server for Linux in Docker has allowed me to continue to develop using a Linux distro or macOS without needing to set up a VM to run the database backend.</span>

                    <span>As awesome as flexbox is, what it’s doing under the hood is actually a little strange because, by default, it is doing two things at once. It first looks at the content size which is what we would get if by declaring width: max-content on an element. But on top of that, flex-shrink is also doing some work allowing the items to be smaller, but only if needed.
Let’s break those two down and see how they work together.

                    <span>In this example I am going to explain you that You can use library to generate breadcrumbs, and also set each page title dynamically.
first you need to install this library to your angular project.
npm install set-title-with-breadcrumbs
This will install library called set-title-with-breadcrumbs, this library is used to generate breadcrumbs component and also you can set page title using angular router. After installing this library..
Go to your app.module.ts file and add below code
import { SetTitleWithBreadcrumbsModule} from &#x27;set-title-with-breadcrumbs&#x27;;
    @NgModule({
        imports : [SetTitleWithBreadcrumbsModule]
    })

in side your app-routing.module.ts file you have to add new data:{} object with breadcrumbs and title object property.
const routes: Routes &#x3D; [
  {
    path: &#x27;home&#x27;,
    component: HomeComponent,
    data: { title: &#x27;Home Page&#x27;, breadcrums: &#x27;Home&#x27; },
    children: [
      {
        path: &#x27;records&#x27;,
        component: RecordsComponent,
        data: { title: &#x27;Find Records Page&#x27;, breadcrums: &#x27;Find-Records&#x27; },
        children: [
          {
            path: &#x27;child&#x27;,
            component: ChildComponent,
            data: { title: &#x27;Child Record Page&#x27;, breadcrums: &#x27;Child-Record&#x27; }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]

as you can see above, each router-path has data object with two property - breadcrumbs and title.
Now inside your app.component.html file you need to add component of library.

In this article, we are going to cover what is Angular Pipe, how to create it and utilize it in our template. Additionally, we will learn how to boost performance with a custom Pipe. 
From  Angular Documentation, 
Use pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, and other data for display. Pipes are simple functions you can use in template expressions to accept an input value and return a transformed value.
Usecase of pipe:
Use DatePipe to convert the Date object to a human-readable format.
UpperCasePipe can be used to convert text to Uppercase.
CurrencyPipe helps to transform a number to a currency string, formatted according to locale rules.
The best advantage to use Pipe is, while transforming the data, it doesn&#x27;t modify the original data. Let&#x27;s see it in acti…</span>

                    <span>Hi Readers, So if you have been using Angular for a while you might have heard of Angular Change detection. Angular handles all the changes which happen for the application on behalf of us even without our interference. In this article, we are going to discuss angular change detection and then how we can manage that manually.
Even if Angular is doing it for we must know how it&#x27;s working and do we even have ways to modify it. So the answer to later is Yes, we can modify for the component to behave differently based upon our requirement.
So in Angular is there is a change detection cycle that helps render the component tree with the new changes on its own. If there is some value change in the component then you will be able to see the updated value automatically, as Angular re-renders all th…</span>

As usual, if you are a visual learner, or simply prefer to watch and listen instead of reading, here you have the video with the whole explanation and demo, which to be fair is much more complete than this post.

If you rather prefer reading, well... let&#x27;s just continue :)
The GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) is a redesigned, enhanced version of GitHub Packages. It not only replaces the Packages Docker service, but also it represents a fundamental shift in how GitHub will provide packages to its customers, because Packages are now tied to organizations and accounts instead of repos.

                    <span>As you could probably tell from the title, we shipped an SDK for Next.js. This means you can capture errors, measure performance, manage releases, configure suspect commits, and automatically upload sourcemaps to view unminified JavaScript and TypeScript with zero(-ish) configuration.
Why was Next.js next on our list? Well, it’s one of the fastest-growing React frameworks and developers love it. Next.js provides a developer experience that helps with building features rapidly, seeing local changes quickly, and reducing build times.
&quot;Next.js turns traditionally complex decisions into simple implementation details. Spinning up new pages with our existing React components and Material UI went from days to hours with Next.&quot;

                    <span>There&#x27;s a principle in programming called Don&#x27;t Repeat Yourself (DRY). The reason repeated code is a problem is because any change requires fixing code in multiple places. This usually means more work for programmers and more room for errors.


Notice in the example below that the eat method is shared by Cat and Bear:




function Cat(name) {
  this.name &#x3D; name;
}

Cat.prototype &#x3D; {
  constructor: Cat,
  eat: function() {
    console.log(&quot;nom nom nom&quot;);
  }
};

function Bear(name) {
  this.name &#x3D; name;
}

Bear.prototype &#x3D; {
  constructor: Bear,
  eat: function() {
    console.log(&quot;nom nom nom&quot;);
  }
};

The eat method is repeated in two places. The code can be edited to follow the DRY principle by creating a supertype (or parent) called Animal:




function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype &#x3D;…</span>

                    <span>Just like people inherit genes from their parents, an object inherits its prototype directly from the constructor function that created it. For example, here the Dog constructor creates the beagle object:




function Dog(name) {
  this.name &#x3D; name;
}

let beagle &#x3D; new Dog(&quot;Snoopy&quot;);

beagle inherits its prototype from the Dog constructor function. You can show this relationship with the isPrototypeOf method:




Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);

This would return true.
All objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a prototype. Also, an object’s prototype itself is an object.




function Dog(name) {
  this.name &#x3D; name;
}

typeof Dog.prototype; // yields object

Because a prototype is an object, a prototype can have its own prototype! In this case, the prototype of Bird.prototype is Object.prototype:


How is this useful? You may recall the hasOwnProperty method from a previous post:




let beagle &#x3D; new Dog(&quot;Snoopy&quot;);
beagle.hasOwnProperty(&quot;name&quot;);

The hasOwnProperty method is defined in Object.prototype, which can be accessed by Dog.prototype, which can then be accessed by beagle. This is an example of the prototype chain. In this prototype chain, Dog is the supertype for beagle, while beagle is the subtype. Object is a supertype for both Dog and beagle. Object is a supertype for all objects in JavaScript. Therefore, any object can use the hasOwnProperty method.</span>

                    <span>Our team at WebPageTest tried our hand at Twitch recently and realized it can be more than just a gamer platform! The power of a live streaming platform is truly remarkable especially when you have like- minded professionals in the web performance space coming together, learning together and sharing their insights with everyone else. 
And we are just getting started here with performance audits. Coming soon are building integrations, and even hosting experts and fellow community members. 
We just completed our second session today talking about advanced features on WebPageTest and used the Catchpoint (our company) website as well as Allbirds (yes to the shoes!). 
You can check out today&#x27;s broadcast here
In our first session, Tim Kadlec deconstructed a web performance session for Joybird, custom furniture and home décor site using WebPageTest per their request. Be right back - This couch in Bentley Daisey color has caught my attention!  
These live performance sessions on Twitch are turning out to be quite enjoyable, with fun banters among our live streamers as well as serious performance insights for the sites we reviews. It’s all in the chat if you don’t believe me!












If you want to follow along the sessions Tim used, here are the WebPageTest test result URLs:

You may be wondering “Why Twitch, why not YouTube Live?” If you prefer YouTube Live, please let us know and we’ll figure something out. Also, are you wondering “Why Tim Kadlec, why not me or my friend Jane?” Absolutely! Just let us know who and what topic via DM on Twitter
When’s the next session, you ask? It’s every other Thursday! So go ahead and sign up for alerts and share it with your fellow team members and friends
Looking forward to testing and building with you!</span>

                    <span>Cybersecurity and privacy should be priorities for every company when pursuing a digital transformation to maintain security and privacy in the modern digital marketplace.
As DevOps teams develop software solutions and reorganize operations&quot;, the focus is often on speed, automation, and business optimization. Security and regulatory compliance can be overlooked as overhead costs when those initiatives are in fact critical, fundamental necessities.
That kind of oversight -- both in practice and in process -- can be costly.
As far back as 2012, then FBI Director Robert Mueller commented on our vulnerability to cyberattacks, saying that there “are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked, and those that will be.”

                    <span>In a recent talk, the React team announced a new feature called React Server Components (RSC). What is that exactly, and how can we take advantage of it to write better apps? 
If you are familiar with React, you know that it is a client-side library that provides developers with a set of abstractions on top of JavaScript that quickly and efficiently write the user interface to a web application. A client-side library means rendering the view in the DOM is done on the client’s browser using JavaScript. The server, in this case, is only responsible for delivering the bundles of your application containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and doesn’t perform any rendering.
The server sends a response back in HTML containing an empty body and script tags that reference JavaScript bundles in the head.…</span>

Thank you for joining in for this article about YAML files. We will make it today a little lightweight tutorial about YAML configurations file. We will see what it is, how we can get started with it and where we use YAML files all around but maybe missed those little nuances.
Y(A)ML is a data serialization language and it is a strict superset of JSON (javascript object notation). It is data oriented structured language used as an input format for different software applications. We can deduct that the language in the end of the day consist of key:value pairs. YML&#x27;s goal is to be more human readable in a clean and consise manner.
We often use tools available for us by interacting with a GUI interface, but we don&#x27;t realize that under the hood there is nothing more than a YAML…</span>

                    <span>Trunk-Based development. 
Yet another practice that is rarely practiced in our industry, even if it is identified in the Accelerate book as one of the technical capabilities that is correlated with higher delivery performance.
Plenty of blogs and conference talks explain the marvellous benefits of using it.
You probably also needed to practice it to pass Jez Humble&#x27;s  Continuous Integration test:
Each commit should trigger a build and run some test suite.
The build is never broken for more than 10 minutes.
Commit to mainline every day. 
Yes. You need to commit to trunk/master/main every day if you want to claim that your company is doing Continuous Integration.
If with all the existing material, your teammates haven&#x27;t been convinced to use Trunk-Based development, adding more reasons to the debate is foolish.
Replicating the very successful method to convince your company to use Clojure could be a possibility, but a year as CTO teaches you that appealing to people&#x27;s emotions is more effective that any reasoning.
Basically: 

a race to be the first one to commit &amp; push, so it is your teammate -- and not you -- the one that has to deal with any conflicts. 
Happy Trunk-Based developing!
Actually Trunk-Based development is great! For a more serious &quot;Why Trunk-Based development&quot; content I would recommend Mattia Battiston blog Why I love Trunk Based Development or Steve Smith talk The Death of Continuous Integration. Enjoy!</span>

It is an automation server which is open source and free for everyone. It automates some parts of software development like build, testing and deployment.
It is made up on Java and hence portable to work on all major operating systems like MacOS, Windows, Linux, etc.
lets now see Jenkins tutorial for beginners in detail:
In this time of cutting edge technology and new innovations coming up every day, Jenkins plays a major role by giving continuous integration by building robust automation.
Jenkins enhances development and operations process by easy customization, through code testing and wider coverage.
As the big names in the market like e-bay and Facebook are also using Jenkins to increase their performances, it has prompted other businesses to switch over Jenkins.

Well, to give a little explanation of what I was doing, I need to explain how to web works.
Now and then I have been mentioning about Front-end and Back-end, in some way, you can rename both to Client-Side and Server-Side. The Client is often you, the end-user, whoever visits the web app or webpage, technically the client-side code is executed by the browser and do whatever needs to be done. Typically, it means to fetch, display, and update data.

After some quick reading I found out that they need to be imported into the Library, and after some more reading I found wp-cli works with ‘xargs’ in Bash.
Helpful links at Dev Notes and StackOverflow
The command I ended using is as follows through SSH:
find /tmp -name &#x27;*.pdf&#x27; -or -name &#x27;*.doc&#x27; -or -name &#x27;*.jpg&#x27; -or -name &#x27;*.xls&#x27; -or -name &#x27;*.docx&#x27; -or -name &#x27;*.xlsx&#x27; | xarg wp media import

Then you can regenerate all the thumbnails using
wp media regenerate --all

I recommend using screen as the import could stop if the connection gets down, because for me on a Digital Ocean server with 2gb took around 2-3 hours.

One important aspect of cryptographic keys is that they are simply numbers. They are often really, really big numbers, but simple integers nonetheless. Another important aspect of cryptographic keys as used in GPG is that they come in pairs: a public key and a private key. Knowledge of these numbers (the keys) allows us to perform many tasks, two of which we&#x27;ll tackle here:

                    <span>One of the more daunting thing of developing, is to get to know how to deploy, as it&#x27;s almost guaranteed that you will incur in some kind of cost, so before doing the big jump to trying a VPS (as a service), I decided to make a local Virtual Server to do some testing in setting up server environments.
Well, to give a little explanation of what I was doing, I need to explain how to web works.
Now and then I have been mentioning about Front-end and Back-end, in some way, you can rename both to Client-Side and Server-Side. The Client is often you, the end-user, whoever visits the web app or webpage, technically the client-side code is executed by the browser and do whatever needs to be done. Typically, it means to fetch, display, and update data.

                    <span>Introduction



A huge portion of the Internet’s data travels over HTTP/HTTPS through request-response cycles between clients and servers.
Starting A Server 
Express is a Node module, so in order to use it, we will need to import it into our program file. To create a server, the imported express function must be invoked.




const express &#x3D; require(&#x27;express&#x27;);
const app &#x3D; express();

const PORT &#x3D; 4001;
app.listen(PORT, () &#x3D;&gt; {
  console.log(&#x60;Server is listening on port ${PORT}&#x60;);
});

In this example, our app.listen() call will start a server listening on port 4001, and once the server is started it will log &#x27;Server is listening on port 4001&#x27;
Writing Your First Route
&gt; Once the Express server is listening, it can respond to any and all requests. 
&gt; For example, if your server receives a GET request at ‘/about’, we will use a route to define the appropriate functionality for that HTTP verb (GET) and path (/about).




// Open a call to &#x60;app.get()&#x60; below:
app.get(&#x27;/expressions&#x27;,(req,res, next)&#x3D;&gt;{
   // Here we would send back the moods array in response
})

Inside app.js, create a route handler to handle a GET request to &#x27;/expressions&#x27;. For now, give it a req, res, next callback. For now, log the req object inside the callback. Verify that the route works and logs the request by starting your server and clicking the Refresh Expressions button which will send a GET /expressions request.
Sending A Response




app.get(&#x27;/expressions&#x27;, (req, res, next) &#x3D;&gt; {
  res.send(expressions);
});</span>

                    <span>We live in a post-Snowden world. For many, that means assuming none of your digital assets are safe from surveillance.
There are ways, however, to use the internet with insane mathematics in your favor to ensure that no one can see whatever it is that you’re sending to someone else.
Cryptography is an ancient mathematical science that was originally used for military communications, and designed to conceal the contents of a message should it fall into the hands of the enemy. Recent developments in cryptography have added additional uses, including mechanisms for authenticating users on a network, ensuring the integrity of transmitted information and preventing users from repudiating (i.e. rejecting ownership of) their transmitted messages.

In this post I&#x27;ll cover how to configure self-signed SSL certificates using a project called mkcert which makes
The instructions are slightly different depending on your local environment:
Common
WSL2
Firefox on Windows
The first thing you will need is to install mkcert which can be done via homebrew or homebrew for Linux.
$ brew install mkcert

If you intend to use Firefox, you should also install nss.
$ brew install nss

Next run mkcert and pass in the the domain names and IPs you want the certificate to include:
$ mkcert mywebsite.test localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1

Created a new certificate valid for the following names 📜
 - &quot;mywebsite.test&quot;
 - &quot;localhost&quot;
 - &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;

                    <span>Working with open source npm packages is so fast and easy that security and control is often pushed to the infamous &quot;some other time&quot; -  or simply neglected.
But why? There are solutions that add security with almost no effort and without impacting developer performance! Watch the video below to see how easy it is.
Risks associated with using open source npm packages should not be overseen and the number of threats in the ecosystem only increases (like the much discussed dependency confusion). Not to mention that the potential impact on your business is catastrophic. 
To take back control you should look into adding a private npm registry into your supply chain. And working with a private registry does not even have to impact your workflow. Simply configure the registry and use the private registry instead of using registry.npmjs.org directly.
Here&#x27;s a video that shows you just how easy it is to work with secure private registries that are secure by default.





  
  
  What is Bytesafe?


Want to block or quarantine packages that contain vulnerabilities? Need to make sure that your apps don’t depend on code that doesn&#x27;t fulfill your business policies? Or maybe you’re looking for hosted secure private registries to be able to share packages and collaborate?
&quot;Inga problem&quot;, as we say in Swedish &#x3D; Not a problem.
Bytesafe is a devtool that makes life easier to trust code you are dependant on by:
  Controlling what packages and dependencies are being used in applications and securing workflows for both internal and external packages
  Knowing what security and open source license issues exist in the code you depend on so that they can be remediated
  Protecting the business from unintended packages entering the software development lifecycle (dependency confusion) - working like a dependency firewall</span>

RAID 0 disk arrays are known for relatively high data access time, and that’s why people choose to use them primarily because of the considerable boost in the speed of read and write operations. However, their reliability and fault-tolerance leave much to be desired. Even if one of the drives is out of order, all the data in such a disk array is going to be lost. Recovering the information from this array type is quite a challenge, but even then, all the data you may be able to extract will certainly be damaged.

There are some types of linked lists: 
Singly linked list - Each node has only a pointer to the next node. 
Doubly linked list - Each node has pointers to both the previous and next node. 
Circular linked list - The last node points to the first element.

Head - the first node
Tail - the last node
Insertion - It&#x27;s possible to insert a new element anywhere in the list, you just have to take care of the pointers.

                    <span>In this example I am going to explain you that You can use library to generate breadcrumbs, and also set each page title dynamically.
first you need to install this library to your angular project.
npm install set-title-with-breadcrumbs
This will install library called set-title-with-breadcrumbs, this library is used to generate breadcrumbs component and also you can set page title using angular router. After installing this library..
Go to your app.module.ts file and add below code
import { SetTitleWithBreadcrumbsModule} from &#x27;set-title-with-breadcrumbs&#x27;;
    @NgModule({
        imports : [SetTitleWithBreadcrumbsModule]
    })

in side your app-routing.module.ts file you have to add new data:{} object with breadcrumbs and title object property.
const routes: Routes &#x3D; [
  {
    path: &#x27;home&#x27;,
    component: HomeComponent,
    data: { title: &#x27;Home Page&#x27;, breadcrums: &#x27;Home&#x27; },
    children: [
      {
        path: &#x27;records&#x27;,
        component: RecordsComponent,
        data: { title: &#x27;Find Records Page&#x27;, breadcrums: &#x27;Find-Records&#x27; },
        children: [
          {
            path: &#x27;child&#x27;,
            component: ChildComponent,
            data: { title: &#x27;Child Record Page&#x27;, breadcrums: &#x27;Child-Record&#x27; }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]

as you can see above, each router-path has data object with two property - breadcrumbs and title.
Now inside your app.component.html file you need to add component of library.

                    <span>The array is still one if not the major data structure in JavaScript. Especially given the fact that Set and Map were introduced way later, many developers have grown comfortable either going with a plain array or using a library for this purpose.
If we now take into account that the array is the only data structure in JavaScript that comes with functional monad methods (map, filter, forEach, etc.), although there is a proposal going on to add these methods to all iterables, it&#x27;s often more comfortable to go with a plain array for most purposes.
The JavaScript array makes no assumptions about its elements. You can mix and match types, and you can also push duplicates. But what if you only want the unique values of your array?
Gladly, there is a pretty short one-liner that makes it easy for you to filter out duplicates and get an array only containing unique values.
You can combine the spread operator together with the Set constructor to quickly get all unique values of an array:
const array &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4];

const unique Values &#x3D; [...new Set(array)];

There is only one issue with this code: The Set relies on the strict equality comparison (&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;), so it doesn&#x27;t work well for objects.

First we have to create admin module:
ng g m admin --routing
--routing generates our routing module for admin automatically. 
with the help of router module we can pass our admin components. Which will only access by our admin.
ng g c admin/login
And  for showing admin list we have to create one more component 
ng g c admin/list
**Then we have to define our login component and list component inside our admin-routing.module.ts file.
import { ListComponent } from &#x27;./list/list.component&#x27;;

   import { LoginComponent } from &#x27;./login/login.component&#x27;;
const routes: Routes &#x3D; [



After that go to the app.module.ts file and define admin module inside that. 
import { AdminModule } from &#x27;./admin/admin.module&#x27;;



Then, we need to call our login and list component inside our parent component or app.component.html file. 
 


  

And lastly we need for run our project by serving. 
ng serve

                    <span>Top Angular 12 Features That You Should Know| Angular Development 
Angular 12 comes with a slew of performance, language service, compiler, form validation, and other enhancements. One of the primary upgrades contemplated in version 12 is the deprecation of the View engine and the adoption of the Ivy ecosystem.
In addition, Angular 12 offers improved style, Nullish Coalescing, and a move away from Legacy i18n Message-IDs, among other essential improvements that make this version reliable. Angular 12 also includes several bug updates for the compiler, core, router, language service, and other components.
The Angular Roadmap Project&#x27;s primary goal is to create a &#x27;Zoneless Angular,&#x27; which eliminates the need for Zone.js and, as a result, provides developers more freedom. In the previous two m…</span>

                    <span>The Situation


Reactive Forms in Angular are incredibly powerful and let developers design experiences that provide immediate feedback to users. In this post I show how to use RxJS in a reactive form to provide useful UI feedback for a common use case: creating a password strength component to show password indicators to users creating passwords.
First, I decided to create distinct check box form controls for each password requirement and strength indicator. This lets me update the control for each indicator independently. I set the controls to disabled, so that the values can only be triggered programmatically, rather than directly by the user. The requirement indicator values start as false since none of them should be checked at first. I like to set this up in the parent component wher…</span>

                    <span>Building a great web app development is critical for retaining happy users. But with continuous influx of bugs to fix and new features to build, it becomes easier. There are some important steps that you can take to improve your angular App’s performance substantially. Few months before, a web.dev conference discussed “How to stay fast and fresh with Angular”. The discussion was about the measures to improve angular app performance and bundle size.  The suggestions from this discussion were applied through the lens of an ionic app, Ionifits. Ionifits is a Zenefits-inspired human resource demo app showcasing various Ionic app platform technologies like Ionic Framework, Ionic Native Enterprise solutions and Capacitor. These are ready to be tested in your web, iOS or android devices. 
1. Divide App Into Modules For Native Angular Lazy Loading-
$ ionic generate page about/about
2. Keep Angular up-to-date Regularly With “ng update” –
$ ng update @angular/cli @angular/core
Reference the package. json files in the Ionic starter template apps to ensure whether dependencies will work together. The template apps are updated and support latest compatible versions by Ionic framework and DevRel teams.
3. Configure Size Budgets-

                    <span>Selecting data from an Ngrx store has always been achieved by using selectors. As Ngrx has developed over the last couple of years, selectors have become easier and easier to use.
interface Customer { id: number; name: string; }
interface AppState { customers: Customer[] }

export const selectCustomers &#x3D; (state: AppState) &#x3D;&gt; state.customers;

The above selectCustomers selector conveniently returns Customers from the store.
To do this is nice and simple in Ngrx 12+; we can use a factory selector.
import { createSelector } from &#x27;@ngrx/store&#x27;;

interface Customer { id: number; name: string; }
interface AppState { customers: Customer[] }

export const selectCustomers &#x3D; (state: AppState) &#x3D;&gt; state.customers;

// selector with param
export const selectCustomerById &#x3D; (customerId: number) &#x3D;&gt;
  createSelector(
    selectCustomers, 
    (customers: Customers[]) &#x3D;&gt; 
      customers.find(c &#x3D;&gt; c.id &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; customerId) 
  )

We can then get a customer with the id of 123 from the store; by passing a value for the customerId into our selector:
this.store.select(selectCustomerById(123));

Hope this helps you all out as the older method of using props is now deprecated in Ngrx 12+. (https://github.com/ngrx/platform/issues/2980)
I also have a YouTube channel called Coffee Music &amp; Coding which you may find useful for Angular and Ngrx tutorials.</span>

                    <span>I decided to give my laptop a virtual makeover recently. One thing that stuck out was the terminal. 
A terminal is a dark rectangle with text. It&#x27;s utilitarian. There isn&#x27;t a lot of options for making it stylish, but you can make it feel more personal with a few changes.
The 3 major things you can do is: 
Change the colour scheme: I made my own colour scheme. If you are searching, this repo is a great source for colour schemes for many different terminal apps.
Pick a font: I installed a nerd font. Nerd fonts add icons to popular monospace fonts. These icons can be used in your text prompt and are used by some command-line applications to give more of a modern UI-feel. JetBrainsMono Nerd Font is my favourite.
Modify the prompt text: You can configure the text yourself, or try a prompt theme…</span>

                    <span>Since the initial release of React in 2013, Facebook has rolled out a robust collection of tools to help developers with some of the minutiae of the web application development process, allowing them to focus on what matters most.
Despite React’s many capabilities and widespread adoption among developers, I’ve discovered that many of us face the same question: How can we handle complicated states with React? 
This post will look at what state is, how to arrange it, and alternative patterns to use as our applications become more complicated.
React may be thought of as a blueprint in its most basic form. Your application will appear in a specific way depending on the status. React prefers declarative over imperative programming, a fancy way of stating that you express what you want to happen rather than the processes to get there. As a result, appropriately managing the state becomes critical, as the state determines how your program will act.

                    <span>So, you have a frontend app, written in a SPA framework like Angular, React, Vue or maybe Svelte? And you want to find the quickest way to get it to the Cloud? There are many ways to do so, GitHub, Azure Storage, but there&#x27;s also Azure Static Web Apps service. 
So, there are a few moving parts that you may or may not use, like the below
Frontend, this is your app written in a framework like Angular, React.js, Vue.js etc


API, this is your backend that you build using Azure functions, so it&#x27;s Serverless which is great on your wallet but also for architecting with events in the Cloud


Auth, auth is always a bit cumbersome but great once it&#x27;s up and running.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.</span>

                    <span>A veces a los desarrolladores frontend se nos va de la cabeza un poco el tema de la seguridad. Pensando en la calidad de un sitio web, generalmente nos concentramos en rendimiento, SEO y accesibilidad. Sin embargo, la capacidad del sitio web de estar preparado ante ataques maliciosos no es la ideal, Importante! ya que backend y frontend son responsables de la seguridad de los datos que comparten.



PROTÉGETE EN CONTRA DE XSS

En primer lugar es importante tener en cuenta que con esta vulnerabilidad, los atacantes explotan la confianza que un usuario tiene en un sitio en particular, y esto nos da una dimensión del impacto que puede tener.
Este tipo de vulnerabilidad puede ser explotada de dos maneras: de forma reflejada y de forma almacenada.

                    <span>JavaScript functions that return React elements are known as React components. These are the parameters that govern what will be added to the DOM. In addition, react components, like functions, may receive props as arguments, resulting in dynamically returned items.
Props can be of any data type, although component data types may differ. Component A, for example, may anticipate a name argument with a text data type, but component B may anticipate an age argument with a numeric data type. Likewise, D may anticipate an onClick argument with a Function data type, but C may expect a post parameter with an object data type with characteristics like title and date.
How can we tell our component what kind of data it should expect?
This may be done in various methods, but this post will focus on PropTypes and TypeScript. Despite holding identical goals, these two techniques operate in different ways. So we’ll go through what these tools are, how to use them, and tell them apart before trying more advanced techniques.
Prior knowledge of PropTypes and TypeScript is necessary for a thorough understanding of this article. You’ll also require an integrated development environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code.
PropTypes is a type-checking tool for props in React apps that can be used at runtime. The PropTypes efficiency has been provided through the prop-types package since React 15.5. PropTypes let you specify the props that are expected in a component, such as whether they are mandatory or optional. You’ll get a warning in the browser’s JavaScript console if you provide a different type to an element or miss a required prop:

I&#x27;ll quickly use a template to create the nextjs app with basic setup
Typescript, Tailwind support because css is boring.
git clone https://github.com/100lvlmaster/nextjs-tailwind-typescript-starter.git

cd nextjs-tailwind-typescript-starter

yarn

This will give all the required tools already setup. So that we can get the app up and running in no time
You can use your preferred method for making a Http GET request but I&#x27;m using axios in this one.

                    <span>Sometimes in TypeORM you want to save location/coordinates in a type that can take advantage of GIS functions like distance, closeness etc MySQL and Postgres have these functions that get this information when you have geometry data column types.
This was surprisingly difficult to find information on so here&#x27;s my implementation.
I assume you already have a TypeORM project set up.
Install these packages:
npm install wkx geojson 
npm install @types/geojson --save-dev

Then add this custom transformer that converts GeoJSON to WKT and WKT back to GeoJSON
Example GeoJSON:
const location &#x3D; {
   type: &#x27;point&#x27;,
   coordinates: [-74.534, 39.123]
}

Example WKT (like you would use in MySQL query):
POINT(-74.534, 39.123)

This would be saved as BLOB type in MySQL
First you need to add the transformer…</span>

                    <span>You can play along in typescript playground
Built in Pick, Omit and other similar type operators don&#x27;t quite support union types well.
One of the main issues is in keyof. By default when keyof is used with union type it will common keys. this is usually not what you want, for example:
type X &#x3D; 
  | { type: &quot;string&quot;, foo: string, komara: 1 }
  | { type: &quot;number&quot;, foo: number, kzxzdad: string }
  | { type: &quot;undefined&quot;, foo: undefined, ajjs: 1, asdad: 44 }

type Keys &#x3D; keyof T

// type Keys_X &#x3D; &quot;type&quot; | &quot;foo&quot;
type Keys_X &#x3D; Keys

To fix this we want to use distributive conditional types:
type DistributiveKeys &#x3D; T extends unknown ? Keys : never;

// type DistributiveKeys_X &#x3D; &quot;type&quot; | &quot;foo&quot; | &quot;komara&quot; | &quot;kzxzdad&quot; | &quot;ajjs&quot; | &quot;asdad&quot;

No, I&#x27;m serious.
As we saw in the previous article introducing this, React+TDD isn&#x27;t just about &quot;quality&quot; (scare quotes) and eating your vegetables. Particularly when paired with TypeScript and smart tooling, it&#x27;s a pleasurable mode of development -- faster, joyful, puppies.
Let&#x27;s get more specific in this article by going through some of the modes of component development. As a reminder, this article follows a full video+text+code tutorial in the WebStorm Guide.
Using React and TypeScript means good JSX (TSX) and ES6+ support, especially in smart editors. We can see this in action from the tutorial step on this subject.

If this sounds exciting to u, please stay with me as I walk you through this simple little process. If you get in trouble you can check the files in my GitHub repo linked here.
In order to follow this demo u must have Docker installed on your machine. I&#x27;m using Docker Desktop for Windows (you could download here). I&#x27;ll recommend u to use Linux containers and set Docker to use WSL - v2 for its engine instead of Hyper-V.

To test the correctness of the demo u should have installed a client that could connect to SQL Server (I use SQL Server Management Studio).

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
