                    <span>Heeeeey guys, quick tip for those of you who need to deploy your app, there are several ways to deploy your app for free, but what I like the most is Netlify because it&#x27;s so simple and fast:
1- Once logged in, click on
New site from Git

2- Choose where your code is stored:

3- Choose your repository (GitHub):

4- He will ask to set up your build information inBase directory you must put the path to your main page,, Build command this is where you put the command that will generate your project build, I always put it CI&#x3D; npm run build
CI &#x3D; CI means continuous integration

5- If everything is ok, it will show this page saying that your application was successfully uploaded.

6- Click Add custom domain to place a domain you have purchased or click Edit site name to change only the Netlify domain name:

And voila, your application is already online and 100% free.

Thanks for reading.</span>

You could have come across this in your browser or IDE when you search for something, the matching items will be highlighted to point you to the exact place of occurrence.
Here is what we are going to build in this post. A very simple and straightforward highlight directive in Angular. We see something similar in chrome dev tools.
The idea is pretty simple. We just have to match the searched term and somehow wrap the matched text in a span or mark (ref) tag so that we can style them later according to our needs.
We are going to use Regex to find matches in our paragraph. Regex makes it very simple to do operations like this on strings. The directive…</span>

Can an Angular application store tokens in localStorage?
– Yes, of course! LocalStorage is persistent storage, so the token is available to all tabs and windows. It even survives a browser restart.
– No, absolutely not! LocalStorage is insecure, and an attacker will be able to steal the token.

                    <span>Cloud adoption has many benefits, the most notable of which being the wide range of options and price models available. Your cloud charge, on the other hand, can get confusing. If you don’t keep track of it and review it on a daily basis, the expenses can easily escalate out of control. Fast scalability, pay-as-you-go pricing, and a vast array of options and updates can make things very complicated. 
Every company should actively monitor its cloud costs, which can drive up the overall cloud bill. However, if you handle them properly, this can be avoided. Here are some AWS charges you should keep an eye on.

                    <span>Hi everyone,
Mastering git takes time and trust me, I&#x27;ve switched from SVN to git. So, I know the hurdles a beginner would face. I&#x27;ve seen many people who are not comfortable using git or doesn&#x27;t use git properly.
There are so many commands we can use, but some commands are used more frequently(some daily). So in this post, I will share and explain the commands which every developer should know.
Git clone is a command for downloading existing source code from a remote repository (like GitHub, for example). In other words, Git clone basically makes an identical copy of the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it to our computer.
There are a couple of ways to download the source code, but mostly I prefer the clone with https way:

                    <span>April 2020. I&#x27;d just begun coding regularly in Python. Built a toxic tweet classifier using LSTM models. Model wasn&#x27;t spectacular by any standard, but during the whole process, I was introduced to something that would change the way I look at software development completely. It was, the Cloud.
I need to run the model faster so I used Virtual Machine in Google Cloud Platform to run the training on a higher configuration. And that was about it.
Fast forward a few months. August 2020. I was experimenting with random tools of NLP and tested out a chatbot using Rasa.

  return arr;
}

chunkArrayInGroups([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;], 2);

Answer:




function chunkArrayInGroups(arr, size) {
  let newArr &#x3D; [];

  while (arr.length) {
    newArr.push(arr.splice(0, size));
  }

  return newArr;
}

console.log(chunkArrayInGroups([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;], 2)); // will display [[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], [&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;]]

Firstly, we create a variable. newArr is an empty array which we will push to.
Our while loop loops until we dont have a length of the array.
Inside our loop, we push to the newArr array using arr.splice(0, size).
For each iteration of while loop, size tells the array how many we want to either add or remove .
Finally, we return the value of newArr.</span>

                    <span>function mutation(arr) {
  return arr;
}

mutation([&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;hey&quot;]);

For example, [&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;], should return true because all of the letters in the second string are present in the first, ignoring case.
The arguments [&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;hey&quot;] should return false because the string hello does not contain a y.
If everything is lowercase it will be easier to compare.
Our strings might be easier to work with if they were arrays of characters.
A loop might help. Use indexOf() to check if the letter of the second word is on the first.


Answer:




function mutation(arr) {
   let firstWord &#x3D; arr[0].toLowerCase();
   let secondWord &#x3D; arr[1].toLowerCase();

   for (let i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; secondWord.length; i++) {
    let letters &#x3D; secondWord[i];
    if (firstWord.indexOf(letters) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; -1) return false;
   }
      return true;
 }

For example, getIndexToIns([1,2,3,4], 1.5) should return 1 because it is greater than 1 (index 0), but less than 2 (index 1).


Answer:




function getIndexToIns(arr, num) {
  arr.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  });

  for (let i &#x3D; 0; i &#x3D; num) return i;
  }

  return arr.length;
}

getIndexToIns([40, 60], 50); // will display [40, 50, 60]

First I sort the array using .sort(callbackFunction) to sort it by lowest to highest, from left to right.
Then I use a for loop to compare the items in the array starting from the smallest one. When an item on the array is greater than the number we are comparing against, then we return the index as an integer.</span>

}

bouncer([7, &quot;ate&quot;, &quot;&quot;, false, 9]);

We should remove all falsy values from an array.
Falsy values in JavaScript are false, null, 0, &quot;&quot;, undefined, and NaN.
// regular for loop that I use which is 
for (let i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; arr.length: i++) { // which reads indexes.
// This new method while watching videos which is 
 for (let elem of arr {
 console.log(elem); 
 }
// basically its a loop that goes through all the elements themselves instead of going through the indexes.
 if (false) {
 console.log(&quot;hello&quot;) 
; // it wont call out hello because false is a falsey value

Answer:




function bouncer(arr) {
  let result &#x3D; [];
  for (let elem of arr) {
    if (elem) result.push(elem);
  }
  return result;
}

bouncer([7, &quot;ate&quot;, &quot;&quot;, false, 9]); // will display [7, &quot;ate&quot;, 9]</span>

frankenSplice([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 1);

Here You are given two arrays and an index.
Let&#x27;s Copy each element of the first array into the second array, in order.
We begin inserting elements at index n of the second array.
Then you should return the resulting array. The input arrays should remain the same after the function runs.
####Hint:
The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.
The splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place


Answer:




function frankenSplice(arr1, arr2, n) {
  let copiedArr &#x3D; arr2.slice();
  copiedArr.splice(n, 0, ...arr1);
  return copiedArr;
}

console.log(frankenSplice([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 1)); // will display [4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6];</span>

                    <span>The Incident Commander is a powerful role in the world of Incident Management. Like Flight Directors in NASA missions, they have responsibility for the decisions made and actions taken during an incident. Depending on your company’s process, they may have powers like stopping deployments, commandeering staff or even shutting down the service. Whatever they deem necessary for resolving the incident.
In many software organizations, the Incident Commander is an on-call rotation, shared amongst senior members of the engineering team. And this seems logical right? Engineering managers and senior engineers will be close to the technology involved, so are best placed to solve the issues that may arise.

                    <span>I would like to present you a simple script which I wrote when I needed to merge the passwords database from LastPass to my current KeepassXC database.

Let&#x27;s start with my example, you want to migrate from LastPass but you already have existing passwords in Keepass.
That&#x27;s why I wrote this script which will merge multiple databases exported in CSV and remove duplikats automatically.
ProHint: If you are esporting a database from LastPass (or other services), add the exported CSV first to the new Keepass database and set the columns you have on your other Keepass database and export as new CSV file. This will make sure you have the same columns in the current database and the new one.
My columns look like this: 
Group | Title | Username | Password | URL | Notes
To install and start the CSV database merge you can easily install from npmjs.com
$ npm install merge-csv-keepass -g
or
$ yarn global add merge-csv-keepass

It is very easy to use, after installation you have access to a new command merge-csv-keepass where you just need to add few arguments and you are done!
Example, we have a database db1.csv and db2.csv we want to merge them into a file merged_db.csv to do this we run the command:
merge-csv-keepass -source db1.csv db2.csv -output merged_db.csv

Done! Simple, isn&#x27;t it?
Keep in mind that the script does not check if the output file exists! If it exists it will overwrite it!
Of course you can add more databases than just two to merge, or even just one database to only remove duplikats from it.
The whole project is open source and available on Github.

Enjoy your merging! :)</span>

Two fundamental problems here:
Source data
Solid and performant indexing solution
As for source data, I had two choices, read the blog posts from already generated HTML files or prepare JSON data with all blog posts at the build time. I chose the second one because the first one seems a little bit clunky and problematic. There could be many different edge cases when collecting the data. When building, I generate HTML files from markdown source files, so I had this step anyway.

                    <span>Working with audio as a developer can unlock many awesome features, and a lot of fun. You can generate music, analyze audio using machine learning, build audio visualizers, music information retrieval systems, and much more. It&#x27;s an extremely fun field. But working with audio can be tricky - how is sound represented on a computer? How can we manipulate that sound? And how do we serialize sound data to disk?

I would expect most engineers in the JavaScript ecosystem to know all about either NPM or Yarn, as they are critical to most local, CI and CD flows. However in the overview section I am going to cover the core functionality, as this is what we will focus on building later.

The front side is built with React, and the form data is sent to the api by post using JavaScript fetch.
Then, the api receives the form data and saves the data to the server.
To edit the user&#x27;s information, imagine that the user has to register his name and driver&#x27;s license (back and front) with the service, and look at the code.
In the following log, the form data created on the front side is received by post to get the data contained in the request.
At first, I couldn&#x27;t get the image in the body of the request, so I looked at the log of various requests, and found that the files contained image data.

                    <span>Recently the Confectionery tool was open-sourced after some internal iterations within Cigna. The project was a combined effort from multiple teams and we&#x27;re excited to see the wider community be able to leverage it.
So what is Confectionery anyways?  It is a rule library for the Conftest tool. By leveraging Conftest, teams can validate various configuration files via static scanning and policies written in the Rego language. The Confectionery ruleset as of the writing of this article is focused on Terraform. We plan to expand to other formats in the near future (Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests). I&#x27;ve previously written about how Conftest can be used to scan Terraform files, please see my article from last year on the topic.

                    <span>I would like to present you a simple script which I wrote when I needed to merge the passwords database from LastPass to my current KeepassXC database.

Let&#x27;s start with my example, you want to migrate from LastPass but you already have existing passwords in Keepass.
That&#x27;s why I wrote this script which will merge multiple databases exported in CSV and remove duplikats automatically.
ProHint: If you are esporting a database from LastPass (or other services), add the exported CSV first to the new Keepass database and set the columns you have on your other Keepass database and export as new CSV file. This will make sure you have the same columns in the current database and the new one.
My columns look like this: 
Group | Title | Username | Password | URL | Notes
To install and start the CSV database merge you can easily install from npmjs.com
$ npm install merge-csv-keepass -g
or
$ yarn global add merge-csv-keepass

It is very easy to use, after installation you have access to a new command merge-csv-keepass where you just need to add few arguments and you are done!
Example, we have a database db1.csv and db2.csv we want to merge them into a file merged_db.csv to do this we run the command:
merge-csv-keepass -source db1.csv db2.csv -output merged_db.csv

Done! Simple, isn&#x27;t it?
Keep in mind that the script does not check if the output file exists! If it exists it will overwrite it!
Of course you can add more databases than just two to merge, or even just one database to only remove duplikats from it.
The whole project is open source and available on Github.

  Intro 


Continuing on from my previous blog about website security week, we&#x27;re going to talk about a CORS on the web.
CORS is Cross-origin Resource Sharing this is often used when your website is hosted separately from your API. e.g. your website is at website.com and calls your API at api.com.



To allow CORS requests your API will need to response with certain headers, which allow certain behaviors from your website/frontend.
This header can be set with either the origin which will be calling the API, it can only be a single origin.
* however this doesn&#x27;t allow credentials to be passed, which we will talk about later.
If at all possible prefer setting a specific origin to a *.

                    <span>Encryption is a two-way function. You can encrypt data, like a file, and then later decrypt it provided you have the proper encryption key. This is useful when you need to retrieve the original data.
Hashing, on the other hand, is a one-way function. It scrambles the input data into a unique output and you cannot reverse this process to reveal the original data.
How is a non-reversible operation useful? It&#x27;s more secure for things like passwords. With encryption, the website server needs to have the encryption key to decrypt it. If the server gets hacked, the attackers could get this key and decrypt every user&#x27;s password immediately.
With hashing, there is no key. Websites don&#x27;t actually need to know a user&#x27;s password, they just need to know that what the user enters in the password field matches what is stored in the database. They can do this by taking the password the user enters, hashing it in the same way they hashed it when the user first set it, and making sure both match. If they do, you get to log in.
If an attacker gets a list of hashed passwords, they&#x27;d have to generate a bunch of guesses, hash each one using the same algorithm, and compare the result to the hashed values one-by-one.</span>

                    <span>We continue to develop PVS-Studio as a SAST solution. Thus, one of our major goals is expanding OWASP coverage. You might ask, what&#x27;s the use when there&#x27;s no taint analysis? That&#x27;s exactly what we thought - and decided to implement taint analysis in the C# analyzer. Curious about what we accomplished? Read on!

Note. This article briefly touches upon the topics of SQL injections and working with SQL in C#. This theory serves as context. For in-depth information on these topics, do additional research.
Taint analysis helps track data that a program receives from an external source (taint source). Though such data is considered tainted, it does not necessarily cause damage when spreading. However, programs may have key points (taint sinks). When tainted data hits them, this interaction may r…</span>

                    <span>Hooks have landed the React world pretty hard. It isn&#x27;t a full-on victory everywhere, I know places where people have more of a &quot;they&#x27;re kids toys&quot; mentality and stay in 100% class + hookless function components, but in general I guess we can agree hooks have been a success.
There are a lot of posts on why hooks are great already, but I want to focus a bit more on nuances that might help you decide when to use classes, and when hooks are the better fit.
You can add context to class components, but the syntax can be a bit awkward especially if you&#x27;re also using TypeScript and want to get the goodies:
class YourComponent extends React.PureComponent {
  static contextType &#x3D; YourContext;
  context: React.ContextType;

                    <span>The main reason for using interfaces is to achieve polymorphism and to provide developers with the ability to implement interface methods in their own way in the future.
In this example I will use TypeScript and I will put the repository at the end of the note
Suppose we have an interface and three classes:

This is the connector interface.
Now we are going to implement the Wifi communication.

Here we have developed our concrete class called WifiConnector which has its own implementation of type Connector.
Now we are creating our System which has a Connector component. This is called dependency injection.


Connector is an interface and must have the method doConnect().
Now, since Connector is an interface, the System class has much more flexibility.
We can pass any type that has implemented the Connector interface.
For example, now the developer wants to add a Bluetooth  connection module:

We see that WifiConnector and BluetoothConnector have their own implementation.
So we can pass any of them to the System class as a constructor parameter. This is called polymorphism.
The System class is now not aware of whether it is Bluetooth or Wifi. We can even add another communication module such as Infrared, Bluetooth5 and whatever, simply by implementing the Connector interface.
This is called Duck Typing. The connector type is now dynamic since doConnect() is just a placeholder and the developer implements it as their own.

}

Above is an example of a function with a generic parameter T that could potentially be used within the function body. However, if the above code is saved in a .tsx file (In my context, within a React application, while trying to create a generic custom hook), you will receive with the following error when hover over  :
JSX element &#x27;T&#x27; has no corresponding closing tag.ts(17008)
Cannot find name &#x27;T&#x27;.ts(2304)

To resolve the issue, I started with researching on how to properly define a generic function in TypeScript. Perhaps I made a mistake somewhere in the above syntax. I landed on two articles here and here. Both of  them talked about how to create a custom React hook that uses…</span>

Like this:

This is almost a joke when compared to Python, which does the same thing in less than half the lines and far fewer words.

However, the difference between the two is not as dramatic as it looks at first blush. Really, java is just asking for more things that a language like Python will leave as optional.

NestJS is a nice little framework for using typescript with node. It enforces opinionated design patterns that are supposed to be familiar to Java Programmers who have worked with Spring. It&#x27;s built off of Node-TS and can be configured a whole shit-ton of ways. I&#x27;m personally making a postgres database using TypeORM and I&#x27;m not hating the process.

You could have come across this in your browser or IDE when you search for something, the matching items will be highlighted to point you to the exact place of occurrence.
Here is what we are going to build in this post. A very simple and straightforward highlight directive in Angular. We see something similar in chrome dev tools.
The idea is pretty simple. We just have to match the searched term and somehow wrap the matched text in a span or mark (ref) tag so that we can style them later according to our needs.
We are going to use Regex to find matches in our paragraph. Regex makes it very simple to do operations like this on strings. The directive…</span>

This article is targeted to beginning-to-intermediate-level Angular developers wishing to obtain insight into methods for state management in front-end applications. A simple, but highly customizable, reactive state-management service is constructed on top of the RxJs BehaviorSubject. This approach can be used for both management of a global store or as model manager for a lazy-loaded route. Both use cases are illustrated through an Angular version 8 application.
While the code in this application may be extended for practical use in your own applications, there is another motivation for studying the internals of state management. Doing so provides a better understanding of the underlying details of such management, which makes you a better consumer of t…</span>

function State(props: Props) {
  Subscribe(() &#x3D;&gt; {
    console.log(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
  })
}

This library introduces an execution context that removes a lot of the ceremony needed to wire and orchestrate Angular components. It provides a layer of abstraction on top of existing Angular constructs, such as lifecycle hooks, change detection, queries, host bindings and host listeners. It embraces the power of RxJS with composable subscriptions. Angular Composition API is designed to feel native to the Angular developer.
There are two core APIs: View and Service.
The View API is a mixin that extends an Angular component or directive. It takes a State factory function and optional Prop…</span>

Myth #1: Steep Learning Curve in Angular

One of the famous misleading opinions we observe among people especially on Twitter and youtube gurus is ‘Angular has a steep learning curve’. The short answer is yes, Angular has not a small road to learning and master. But let’s first analyze the definition of this concept. A steep learning curve refers to: ‘The amount of time required to learn is big’. Interesting but what makes it BIG? First, let’s point out Angular is a fully-featured framework. It has built-i…</span>

                    <span>There could scenarios where you would want to isolate traffic on network interfaces for specific layers of applications. Example, one interface attached to an application machine can act as a receiving endpoint for application-bound traffic and another network interface can act as a communication interface with the database / data layer. This scenario can be visualised as :

Now, lets see how this can be implemented. I am going to use Azure for demonstration.
In Azure, private networks are referred to as &#x27;Virtual Networks&#x27; and sub-networks as &#x27;Subnets’
Our virtual network&#x27;s address space is : 10.0.16.0/22.
Here, as you can see we have our application linux machine (also referred to as Virtual Machine aka VM) in a virtual network. The VM has two network interfaces. One is in first subnet (l…</span>

                    <span>Welcome to the short guide on how to install Nginx on your server running Ubuntu 20.04.
So what is Nginx? As per nginx.com: 
Nginx is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.
So in short, Nginx is a web server that has many capabilities in serving the content on server to the users.
You have to check that the server you want to install Nginx on is properly configured before proceeding so you can install and configure Nginx without any future issues. You can re…</span>

Como ficou decidido que o objetivo era se tornar um dev front-end, agora precisava desvendar o caminho das pedras para conseguir chegar a terra sonhada. 
Pra isso, precisava responder algumas perguntas como:
- Certo, mas por onde eu começo?
- Tem algum curso bom?
- Quais são as melhores escolas?
Saí em busca das respostas, na maravilhosa rede internética mundial de computadores e como nada é simples, muito menos na vida de um newbie, todos os lugares respondiam coisas diferentes.
Mas tinha um consenso. Quer ser Front-End? Aprenda HTML5, CSS e JavaScript. É isso, simples assim, agora voa assombração, se vira.
Mas onde, caral@#%, vou iniciar essa jornada? 🤯
Entre os óbvios, e pagos, que seriam a Alura e a Udemy, encontrei num fórum que não lembro qual (obrigado …</span>

                    <span>In order to secure your website with Basic HTTP authentication in Traefik do the following.
apache2-utils





sudo apt install apache2-utils

htpasswd -nB adam

The n option will display the hash in stdout and the B option will use more secure encryption.
devto password&#x27;s hash is shown below:
adam:$2y$05$h9OxLeY20/5uiXjfPgdRxuFlrfqBf2QifYDgrwsR6rAEgX3/dpOGq

Remember to use the escaped double $.
You may have existing rules for your HTTPS route, e.g. compressing, etc.
So create a new chain where you&#x27;ll combine your existing middlewars and the newly created yoursite-basicauth.
In your docker-compose.yml file:
  labels:
    - &quot;traefik.http.middlewares.yourservice-https-chain.chain.middlewares&#x3D;yourservice-basicauth,yourservice-other-middleware-remove-or-replace-with-yours&quot;

                    <span>When I started writing code, I used Notepad and Notepad++. When I switched to OS X. In my first computer science class in high school we used Visual Studio.
When I finally migrated to Linux, I started using vi/vim after using nano for a while. Unlike nano, vim is a lot more powerful but is harder to learn.
How did I go from never using vim to using it all the time? How does one make a complete switch? I&#x27;ll walk you through how I got here and share some tips along the way.
If you are trying to learn Vim, or you are on the fence about it, here are my top 5 reasons why I love this keyboard-centered editor:
The more I used it, the faster I became, and the faster I became the more productive I was.


It&#x27;s everywhere. Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and every other operating system supports Vi/Vim. 


I don&#x27;t like to use my mouse. I never did anything in Sublime Text without the help of my mouse. This is a annoying, easier to keep hands on the keyboard


It can be used over the network using ssh. Login to any box and use it.


I use it for almost everything: programming, writing, blogging, etc.




Switching is up to you, but here are my reasons.
Why would somebody use ancient tools like vi/vim when there are so many modern ones out there? 
One day I had to answer this question for my friend. He asked, “Why don’t you use Sublime Text like me?” I explain to him that sometimes it’s better to use older/simpler tools than more complex ones.
Here are my reasons:
Learn how to use the best editor ever made.
Never get lost in a sea of menus and toolbars that you never use (just like vim does not have any).
Have an excuse to use powerful, built-in commands that are available in no other editor (and are faster than anything you can do with a GUI).
Work fast using commands

                    <span>tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals (or windows), each running a separate program, to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. 
tmux may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached. 
It allows you to easily manage separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window. 
tmux can connect to a server, and multiple clients can be connected to the same session, simultaneously exchanging their input and display.

You can use these commands and shortcuts to work with tmux in Linux. From the command line:



Session Control





tmux
Start a new session


tmux new -s 
Start a new session with the name chosen


tmux ls
List all sessions






Pane Control





Ctrl b, &quot;
Split pane horizontally


Ctrl b, %
Split pane vertically


Ctrl b, o
Next pane



I&#x27;ve used tmux for years, and it has become an essential part of my work flow. I couldn&#x27;t imagine editing code without it. If you want to practice Linux commands, you can use these exercises 
tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.
Features include:
• Splitting a terminal window into horizontal or vertical panes.

tmux is very useful for people who commonly work on remote machines via ssh.
Why did I pick tmux over screen and a terminal multiplexer? Three reasons.
First, tmux is written is responsive and light.
Second, tmux is much more expressive than screen. I can split my terminal into six panes and change the size of each pane with the same ease as resizing a terminal in GNU Screen.
Third, tmux has integrated support for a status bar. This means I can read from one pane and keep an eye on other panes at the same time.</span>

When your overall project is composed of multiple projects, it is tempting to create one Git repository per project. In Node.js, a project translates to a package. However, managing too many closely related repositories is confusing and time-consuming.
Placing multiple projects inside a single Git repository and using a tool like Lerna to facilitate their management worth the effort. This architecture is called a monorepo. It simplifies the versioning and publishing of the components as well as their manipulation and development.
At Adaltas, we have been developing and maintaining several monorepos for a couple of years. This article is the first one from a serie of five in which we share our best practices. It covers the projec…</span>

Rate limiting is a method used for controlling network traffic. It limits the number of actions a user can make per unit of time 1. In this tutorial, we will rate limit a login route to help protect it from brute force attacks. This limits the number of password guesses that can be made by an attacker. We&#x27;ll use the npm package node-rate-limiter-flexible to count and limit the number of login attempts by key. Each key will have a points value that will count the number of failed login attempts. The keys will expire after a set amount of time. The key-value pairs will be stored in Redis, which is an open-source in-memory data structure store. It has many different use cases. We will use it as a simple database. Redis is simple to use and very fast. We&#x27;ll create an online inst…</span>

Programatically sending requests in Node.js can be a frustrating experience. First, you have to choose one out of many request libraries in the ecosystem. Second, they each have a slightly different API which is confusing when you&#x27;re switching.
You also have to make sure the request is formatted in a specific way for the 3rd party on the receiving end to accept it.
Just as you&#x27;re starting to get the hand of axios, you soon find out there are (subtle) usage differences depending on whether you&#x27;re in the browser or Node.js.
What a pain.
Only if sending files with axios in Node.js would be as easy as taking a walk in the park.

                    <span>In JavaScript, modules are pieces of encapsulated code that can reused in different parts of your application or program whenever you need it.
Basically you can write your JavaScript code without modules but breaking down your code into multiple reusable modules helps you to keep your code clean, readable, reusable and mode manageable when you have dependencies.
The syntax for modules was officially introduced in ES6. Let&#x27;s have a look at the various ways we can achieve this:
This method is used for the browser environments. Large web applications require many external modules. Now, the traditional way of loading them is using the  element.

                    <span>Introduction


Rate limiting is a method used for controlling network traffic. It limits the number of actions a user can make per unit of time 1. In this tutorial, we will rate limit a login route to help protect it from brute force attacks. This limits the number of password guesses that can be made by an attacker. We&#x27;ll use the npm package node-rate-limiter-flexible to count and limit the number of login attempts by key. Each key will have a points value that will count the number of failed login attempts. The keys will expire after a set amount of time. The key-value pairs will be stored in Redis, which is an open-source in-memory data structure store. It has many different use cases. We will use it as a simple database. Redis is simple to use and very fast. We&#x27;ll create an online inst…</span>

                    <span>Often times it isn’t obvious whether an app or program features a dark mode. And it’s often an unassuming option buried in a menu somewhere.
But for those of you who are night owls, you’ll know that it works by reversing the usual color scheme of your windows putting light colored text on a dark background.
But it isn’t as simple as just Inverting the colors on a web page and calling it a day and you can see this if you have a browser extension that applies a dark mode as some elements on the page often. Don’t look as nice while other ones such as images won’t invert or dim properly.
So coding a good-looking dark mode that is specific to a certain website often requires a fair. A bit of finesse.
However, this often ends up being worth it as dark mode ends up delivering quite a few benefits…</span>

The Typeable Team appreciates security! We love Haskell, but is Haskell a good choice when secure software is the goal? We would love to say yes, but like most empirical questions about software development, there is simply no hard evidence that Haskell, or any general programming language, is more secure than any other. That is not to say that the Typeable&#x27;s language choice doesn&#x27;t matter in regards to security, but how it does may need to be elaborated.
After teaching introductory Software Security for half a decade I can attest that Software Security has no universal theory on which to rely.  Security is most often taught by enumerating different security issues, mitigations and security models and hoping that students can build from them to gain general understa…</span>

                    <span>The idea behind Encrypting your S3 object is that you upload objects onto Amazon S3 and these are servers of AWS so you may want to make sure that these objects are not accessible for example, if someone gets into the Amazon servers or you wanna make sure you get adhere to some security standards set up by your company. As such, Amazon gives you four methods to encrypt objects in Amazon S3. 
The first one is called SSE S3. This is to encrypt S3 objects, using keys handled and managed by AWS. 
The second one is SSE-KMS. It leverages AWS key management service to manage your encryption keys. 
The third one is SSE-C. It is used when you manage your own encryption keys.
Finally Client-side encryption.
Now we&#x27;re going to do a deep dive on all of those so don&#x27;t worry.

The last time I wanted to publish a npm package was in 2018. It was a React library which provided Components for creating Forms. It wasn’t straight forward to publish such a library back then. There were so many things to handle on your own, especially when it came to TypeScript.
Assuming you were already familiar with webpack you thought: ha that should be easy, I can leverage my knowledge and just bundle my library with webpack, exactly like my webapps. But then you suddenly heard of that new kid on the block: Rollup, which seems to do a better job at bundling libraries. So a new bundler you had to learn and still soo many things to take care of on your own.

Learning from React series:

Part 1 - why examining React is useful even if you won&#x27;t end up using it
Part 2 - what Facebook wanted to do with React and how to get a grasp on it
Part 3 (this one) - what is Reactive Programming all about?
The name React is already declaring that it is used in reactive programming, but what is that? Wikipedia is defining it as &quot;a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change&quot;. It expands on that to say that it declares the relationship between elements and updates them when either change. You can easily imagine a graph of elements magically updating as any of them changes. However, the implementation details of that magic matter.

In one of the applications that I&#x27;m working on, I have to calculate what is a previous month of a given date. It seems easy, isn&#x27;t it? Golang provides the time package which has a method: AddDate.  
I&#x27;m quite fresh in Go, previously I was working with C#, Python and (for some time) TypeScript. Every one of these languages has also some methods to calculate time. Let&#x27;s see how they work.
Let&#x27;s use System.DateTime.AddMonths:
using System;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var endOfMay &#x3D; new DateTime(2021, 05, 31, 12, 00, 00);

Continuing on from my previous blog about website security week, we&#x27;re going to talk about a validation.
If accept user input, you are going to need to validate the input. Non validated user inputs can lead to security vulnerabilities for example SQL injection attacks, where user input escapes your database and starts modifying it. It can also lead to exceptions from your code if a user inputs text rather than a number for example.
Please Please Please ensure you do the same validation server side as you do on the frontend (client) side.



You user inputs should be contained in HTML forms which comes with lots of powerful validation tools built in.
First thing to check on your inputs is, are you using the correc…</span>

For the purpose of this demo, I have already created a simple Angular 7 application that is hosted on Gitlab, the application is a simple, digital clock that looks something like this.


The above diagram describes the whole process, right from a developer pushing the code, to the point where the CI/CD Pipeline builds &amp; deploys the code to Azure Storage (Blob) which is linked to Azure CDN Endpoint.
Developer goes ahead and performs the development locally of the application after which he goes ahead and commits and pushes the code to the version control system in our case it’s Gitlab.


We would then have Gitlab perform the CI/CD in the form of the steps mentioned in git…</span>

                    <span>No, upgrading to Angular 12.x.x will not help.
The Typescript experimental decorators were based on TC39 proposal-decorators.
We use the same Decorators in our Angular codebase to create services, components and other Angular constructs.
But the same TC39 proposal has evolved in a different direction which is semantically not compatible with the experimental Typescript decorators.   
The new spec for Decorators is easier to use and write.
You can find the detailed comparison between old and new decorators here. 
Just finished up the first draft of the new decorators spec, pretty excited about it 😄 https://t.co/ELhZbsiaiR

Does this mean that Typescript experimental decorators will not be compatible with Javascript decorators 😨
— Shivam (@shivamd20

Unfortunately no, the new proposal has differing semantics from previous proposals in a number of ways. TypeScript experimental decorators were also incompatible with the Define semantics class fields, which caused a decent amount of breakage in the ecosystem.

When the proposal advances, figuring out a step-by-step incremental upgrade path for existing decorators users is definitely going to be a priority though! No user left behind 😄

Let&#x27;s just hope that this doesn’t result in fragmentation of JavaScript decorators. We have already faced a lot inconvenience due to commonsjs and ES6 imports.</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
