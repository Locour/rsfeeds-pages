~     
I spent the entire month of May 2021 working on an internal monitoring and evaluation system for the non-profit organization Family Promise. Family Promise works with homeless and low income families to help them achieve sustainable independence. They provide various prevention programs to help keep low income families from becoming homeless, as well as sheltering programs for the homeless, and aftercare programs for those who get out of sheltering. These programs are great and I personally love what the organization is doing to help the communities who need it most. That is why I am excited that I had the opportunity to work all month with a team of skilled developers. We spent a lot of time coll…</span>

                    <span>Intro


A cool trick in TypeScript is that you can use a Set to remove nonunique values from an array. Combine this with Array.from and you get a quick one liner to remove none unique values
const unqiueValues &#x3D; Array.from(new Set(YOUR_ARRAY_HERE))

// Our array of non unique values
const values &#x3D; [0,0,1,&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;b&#x27;,&#x27;c&#x27;];

// Create a &#x60;Set&#x60; from our array
// Sets can only contain unique values so duplicate will be removed for us
const uniqueSet &#x3D; new Set(values);

// Create a new array from our set so we can use the Array.length property
const unqiueValues &#x3D; Array.from(uniqueSet);

// Compare the length of the original &#x60;values&#x60; array and the new &#x60;uniqueValues&#x60; array
// If the lengths differ then a non unique value was removed by the set
// This means that the original array contained non-unique values
const isUnique &#x3D; (values.length &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; unqiueValues.length)

const values &#x3D; [0,0,1,&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;a&#x27;,&#x27;b&#x27;,&#x27;c&#x27;];
const unique &#x3D; (Array.from(new Set(values)).length &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; values.length);

onlyUnique(values: Array): boolean {
  return (Array.from(new Set(values)).length &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; values.length);
}

                    <span>No, upgrading to Angular 12.x.x will not help.
The Typescript experimental decorators were based on TC39 proposal-decorators.
We use the same Decorators in our Angular codebase to create services, components and other Angular constructs.
But the same TC39 proposal has evolved in a different direction which is semantically not compatible with the experimental Typescript decorators.   
The new spec for Decorators is easier to use and write.
You can find the detailed comparison between old and new decorators here. 
Just finished up the first draft of the new decorators spec, pretty excited about it 😄 https://t.co/ELhZbsiaiR

Does this mean that Typescript experimental decorators will not be compatible with Javascript decorators 😨
— Shivam (@shivamd20

Unfortunately no, the new proposal has differing semantics from previous proposals in a number of ways. TypeScript experimental decorators were also incompatible with the Define semantics class fields, which caused a decent amount of breakage in the ecosystem.

When the proposal advances, figuring out a step-by-step incremental upgrade path for existing decorators users is definitely going to be a priority though! No user left behind 😄

Let&#x27;s just hope that this doesn’t result in fragmentation of JavaScript decorators. We have already faced a lot inconvenience due to commonsjs and ES6 imports.</span>

I wanted to something fun for the holiday season, so I decided to port a variable-width stroke from the Flex Freehand Drawing Library I created back in the early 2010’s. This stroke actually has a venerable history, going back to about 1983, as an exercise I was assigned as a teaching assistant for a graduate course in computational geometry. The instructor’s company recently obtained a very expensive tablet. This system allowed users to scan or load drawings already in electronic form into a display and annotate them with hand-drawn notes using a fixed-width stroke. The instructor had an idea for a variable-width (speed-dependent) stroke that would be the basis for a number of lab exercises. My job was to get his idea working in Fortran (yes, now you ca…</span>

                    <span>⌨️ Improve the User Experience (UX) of an e-commerce application by implementing animations utilizing Angular animations, CSS animations, and Web Animation APIs.



  
  
  
Developers can use animations in meaningful and non-distracting ways to significantly improve their application&#x27;s user experience (UX). This blog post discusses four effective techniques to animate your application&#x27;s user interface, covering popular use cases. You&#x27;ll learn how to transform bland experiences into memorable ones for your users.
I created a demo application to help you focus on adding animations to Angular. You&#x27;ll add animations to a starter app as you progress through this tutorial. The starter application uses Tailwind to take care of its style and layout, but none of the animations discussed here are dependent on it.
Follow this tutorial without cloning any repo, right in the browser using Stackblitz or CodeSandbox.
If you prefer to work locally in your IDE, clone the demo app and check out its starter branch:
git clone -b starter git@github.com:auth0-blog/angular-animations-storefront.git

Once you clone the repo, make angular-animations-storefront your current directory:
cd angular-animations-storefront

Install the project&#x27;s dependencies:
npm i

Run the project locally:
npm run start

Angular comes with a powerful animation module that lets you quickly add motion to your application: BrowserAnimationsModule. Under the hood, this module uses the Web Animations API (WAAPI) to create motion and interactivity. Whenever WAAPI isn&#x27;t available, BrowserAnimationsModule falls back to using CSS keyframes. Angular animations give you the option to use their abstraction layer to animate any properties that the web considers animatable such as positions, sizes, colors, and many more.

Taking Mark&#x27;s instruction a bit further; to achieve drag&amp;drop in a bit more realistic situation, calling the store in a service asynchronously. To achieve this status, I stumbled on the .valueChanges(...) method.
The internal firestore documents explains the working of this .valueChanges(...) method as it listen to all documents in the retrieved collection and queries this list as an Observable. 
idField. When the idField option is provided like 
.valueChanges({idField: &#x27;&lt;a-property-of-the-document&#x27;}) it means that the document ID (actually the document&#x27;s name) will be mapped to the provided property being one of the properties within the document-object.
Know the construction of the document, in this case document (ITask) &#x3D; { id?: string; title?:string; description?: string&#x27;; }. 

When calling the .valueChanges(...) method with a provided idField, which is set to one of the provided properties as stated, internally, the ID (actually the document&#x27;s name) of that document is mapped to the &#x27;provided&#x27;-property within the document object.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array. For simplicity, the provided array will contain exactly 4 sub-arrays.
Remember, you can iterate through an array with a simple for loop, and access each member with array syntax arr[i].




function largestOfFour(arr) {
  return arr;
}

largestOfFour([[4, 5, 1, 3], [13, 27, 18, 26], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]);

*Hints:
Array[Index][SubIndex]
Answer:




function largestOfFour(arr) {
let largestArr &#x3D; [];
for (let i &#x3D; 0; i &#x3D; tempLarge) {
      tempLarge &#x3D; num
    }
  }
  largestArr.push(tempLarge)
}
  return largestArr;

                    <span>So it&#x27;s time to put your code into production. That means you have to connect some third party stuff, probably some external database or SMTP server. At the same time it would be nice to keep an option to modify and test your codebase with your local database and double-check on some other staging or QA server. But how to achieve this with default settings.py file?
Searching for the solution I found several approaches of splitting the Django settings, but one that worked for me appeared to be a mixture. Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve got it to work with AWS EC2, but it should work with any python environment where you can set your own env variables.
Django settings as a module.
Key environmental variables for production and/or staging servers.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s return the length of the longest word in the provided sentence.
Also the response should be a number in this instance.




function findLongestWordLength(str) {
  return str.length;
}

findLongestWordLength(&quot;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&quot;);

Answer:




function findLongestWordLength(str) {
  let words &#x3D; str.split(&quot; &quot;);
  let longest &#x3D; &quot;&quot;;
  for (let i &#x3D; 0; i  longest.length) {
      longest &#x3D; tempLong;
    }
  }
  return longest.length;
}

findLongestWordLength(&quot;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&quot;); // will display 6

Take the string and convert it into an array of words. Declare a variable to keep track of the maximum length and loop from 0 to the length of the array of words.
Then check for the longest word by comparing the current word to the previous one and storing the new longest word. At the end of the loop just return the number value of the variable maxLength.
function findLongestWordLength(str) {
  let words &#x3D; str.split(&quot; &quot;);
  let longest &#x3D; &quot;&quot;;
  for (let word of words) { //  longest.length) {
      longest &#x3D; word;
    }
  }
  return longest.length;
}

findLongestWordLength(&quot;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&quot;);

Here instead of the for loop that loops through the indexes we loop through the elements themselves.</span>

                    <span>If you are concerned about unwittingly giving access to your AWS account then hopefully this article will help clarify your doubts about what permissions are being granted to Billgist.
When you integrate your AWS account a CloudFormation stack is created with this Billgist template. Feel free to click on that Billgist template to go through it. 
If you inspected the template you would see that it creates an IAM role with only AWS Cost Explorer permissions (that&#x27;s the &quot;ce:*&quot; reference in the template) to the Billgist application.
You can see the role created by the Billgist and the policy attached to the role in the AWS IAM roles in the AWS console.
Additionally, you can also see the created resources in the Resources tab of the CloudFormation console once you started integration process. 

By this time you must be wondering how can I validate all this by myself. AWS provides an interface to display the role, trusted relationships and the policies attached to the role. 
You can follow the steps below to see how. 
Navigate to AWS roles and search for the role start with &quot;billgist*&quot; or see the previous screenshot to get actual name of the role. Once you searched for the role click on it to see the details. 


&quot;Permissions&quot; tab will be selected by default and here you will be able to see the attached policies. Click on the policy and verify which service(s) access has been granted to the role.



In the &quot;Trust relationship&quot; tab you will be able to verify what are the trusted entities for the role. Make sure the trusted entity should be &quot;825617374672&quot; which is the Billgist AWS account




Conclusion
read only Cost Explorer API. We recommended that you do not modify this policy and role by yourself.
If you want to revoke these permissions, remove the integration from Billgist and delete policy and role respectively.</span>

When Github released Github Actions I moved most of my CI/CD pipelines to use a Github workflow. Each project had two workflows, one workflow that ran on Pull Requests, and a second workflow that was triggered when someone pushed a commit to the main branch. These two workflows were almost identical copies, except for the part that the main branch workflow included a release step.
Now, after a big year, I noticed that several workflows of projects that I&#x27;m working on have conditionally configured some steps in their workflow. I&#x27;m not sure, but I think that this wasn&#x27;t always the case... or I completely missed that this was a possibili…</span>

First let’s look at WHAT test cases are, specifically unit testing. Unit testing is a granular level of testing within your project. It tests the individual parts of the puzzle for fitment and correctness - &quot;Does this function behave how I expect it to behave?&quot;. 
WHY do we use unit testing? - The aim of unit testing is to get high code coverage and check each moving part of your program. You shouldn&#x27;t need to run your program everytime you want to check one small piece of functionality. That is only a good way to test &quot;the happy path&quot;, its manual and time consuming.

For this reason, Golang offers a simple way to manage this, without any black magic.
Lets suppose we have just a simple main function that starts a simple http server.
package main

func main{
    StartServer()
}


Maybe this works fine, but this is not aware of anything about the underlying OS. This means that, if something signals the main process to stop, this will just stop or crash without the possibility of gracefully shut down the server and it’s child gorutines.
Imagine now that we could pass a a context with cancellation this function as an argument like StartServer(ctx).

To search for the next occurrence of that search term, press n (for next); to search backwards press N . After pressing n or N , Vim will highlight all matching words, which you can then press on to select.

One of the most powerful features of Vim is its ability to use ex commands. First, in order to run ex commands, you must be in insert mode: that is to say, not at the beginning of a line. 
It’s important to note that in order to enter insert mode, you must first exit normal mode. To do this, press “i” or “a” – these keys will start you off in insert mode at the beginning of a new line or at the end of your current line.
Now that you’re in insert mode, you can type “:” and then an ex command.
Some things you can do are:
:5p print the fifth line
:100p print line 100
:%s/hello/world/ search and replace
:!bash return to bash, type exit to open vim
This saves you quit a few keystrokes. Press the number of times you want to repeat, then press the key. To move 100 lines down, press 100j. To move up 50 lines, press 50k. To delete 5 lines press 5dd etc.

Vim supports keyboard macros. They let you record and replay your keystrokes. This is really great if you have some tedious typing to do.
To start recording press q followed by a. To stop recording press the ESC key. Then press @ followed by a to replay the keystrokes.
If you are new to vim, I recommend this course</span>

Depending on which framework you&#x27;re using and some requirements you have, sometimes it&#x27;s better to have a bash script responsible for running your project. When it&#x27;s available, generally, you&#x27;ll see a bunch of commands that are executed, like the following script I created for the project Django Multiple Schemas:

If you have already read this article I created on how to create a simple authentication and authorization system with JWT, you must have noticed that I send the jwt in response when an http request is made from the login route. That is, the idea is to keep it in localstorage.
However, there are other ways to send the jwt to the frontend and today I will teach you how to store the jwt in a cookie.

  Intro 


Continuing on from my previous blog about website security week, we&#x27;re going to talk about a series of X- security headers.
These are set as headers on your site when it is served up, let&#x27;s dive in!



This header indicates that the browser should not try and sniff the type of the file served up. Sniffing of the file type would mean the browser modifying the Content-Type header that is returned from the server.
Sniffing the file content type could lead to non executable files being made executable, this could lead to bad actors injecting executable code into normal files and could lead to vulnerabilities.
It&#x27;s best not to let the browser sniff the code.
Recommended setting:
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

You can read about it more on Modzilla.



This header has mostly been superseeded by the Content Security Policy, however its still useful for old browsers.
Recommended setting:
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode&#x3D;block

You can read about it more on Modzilla.



This header has mostly been superseeded by the Content Security Policy, however its still useful for old browsers.
This indicates if the site can be loaded in a , ,  or .
Recommended setting:
X-Frame-Options: DENY

You can read about it more on Modzilla.



In summary, setting a few additional headers when serving up your site can really improve the security of your site. It reduces the amount of attack surface there is for attackers and prevent common attacks on websites.
Set those headers now!
Happy Building!</span>

Everyone talks about creating content. But what about controlling it? In this Dogfooding Chronicle, I’ll walk you through how we updated our Content Security Policy using Discover — and how we’re keeping watch with Dashboards.
As the Internet evolves, so must our security mechanisms. It’s why same-origin policies (a Netscape-era directive in which resources from one origin are unable to modify or read data from another origin) put your application at risk for clickjacking and cross-site scripting attacks. That’s because same-origin policies have a weakness that enables third-party entities to have the same access rights as trusted entities. Content Security Policies (CSPs) address this blind spot by approving specific content types — everything from JavaScript sources to CSS…</span>

                    <span>No, upgrading to Angular 12.x.x will not help.
The Typescript experimental decorators were based on TC39 proposal-decorators.
We use the same Decorators in our Angular codebase to create services, components and other Angular constructs.
But the same TC39 proposal has evolved in a different direction which is semantically not compatible with the experimental Typescript decorators.   
The new spec for Decorators is easier to use and write.
You can find the detailed comparison between old and new decorators here. 
Just finished up the first draft of the new decorators spec, pretty excited about it 😄 https://t.co/ELhZbsiaiR

Does this mean that Typescript experimental decorators will not be compatible with Javascript decorators 😨
— Shivam (@shivamd20

Unfortunately no, the new proposal has differing semantics from previous proposals in a number of ways. TypeScript experimental decorators were also incompatible with the Define semantics class fields, which caused a decent amount of breakage in the ecosystem.
— The p is silent (@pzuraq

When the proposal advances, figuring out a step-by-step incremental upgrade path for existing decorators users is definitely going to be a priority though! No user left behind 😄

Let&#x27;s just hope that this doesn’t result in fragmentation of JavaScript decorators. We have already faced a lot inconvenience due to commonsjs and ES6 imports.</span>

Imagine a website with lots of components such as Navbar, Footer, Main Container and Side Menu. What would happen, if they were being served from different domains? Yes, you guessed it right we would&#x27;ve ended up with a micro Frontend. Now, thanks to micro frontend technologies, we can deal with those apps separately. We can write their unit tests separately, e2e tests separately we can even use different frameworks like Angular, Vue and Svelte.
There are two major players to make those things happen right now, one of them is Module Federation and another one is Single SPA which I covered here: 🔗Migrating CRA to Micro Frontends with Single SPA.

I wanted to something fun for the holiday season, so I decided to port a variable-width stroke from the Flex Freehand Drawing Library I created back in the early 2010’s. This stroke actually has a venerable history, going back to about 1983, as an exercise I was assigned as a teaching assistant for a graduate course in computational geometry. The instructor’s company recently obtained a very expensive tablet. This system allowed users to scan or load drawings already in electronic form into a display and annotate them with hand-drawn notes using a fixed-width stroke. The instructor had an idea for a variable-width (speed-dependent) stroke that would be the basis for a number of lab exercises. My job was to get his idea working in Fortran (yes, now you ca…</span>

                    <span>Create React App is a convienient way to start building a new single-page application in React. Your app only needs one build dependency react-scripts. Under the hood it uses webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects to power your app.
If you don&#x27;t like the default scaffold of create react app it really easy to adjust.
Start by creating a folder called cra-template.


Cd into the folder and run yarn init -y or npm init -y if your prefer npm. This will generate a basic package.json file for you.


Create a template.json with your specific template settings. Any dependencies you add here will be added to the final dependency list.

I first came into contact with Next.js about a year ago and have been a big fan ever since! I love features like routing, image optimization or the flexibility to choose between SSG and SSR (or use both). Especially the developer experience feels more pleasant than with React and the support from people like Lee Robinson and Cassidy Williams is just priceless! To me, Next.js feels like a superset of React, similar like TypeScript to Javascript. 🙂
For this reason, I decided to use Next.js for my personal projects. However, I didn&#x27;t want to start from scratch every time and painstakingly put everything together until I have a base I feel c…</span>

                    <span>Storybook decorators (in React) provide a powerful way to reuse component environments across multiple stories. However, there aren&#x27;t any off-the-shelf levers to manipulate global decorators from individual stories.
At work (we&#x27;re hiring!) I recently cleaned up our many context providers into one Base decorator. Here is a simplified example.
// .storybook/decorators/base.tsx
export const Base: DecoratorFn &#x3D; (Story, options) &#x3D;&gt; {
  return (
    
      
    
  );
};

// .storybook/preview.js
import { Base } from &#x27;./decorators/base&#x27;;

export const decorators &#x3D; [Base];

TestReactRoot encapsulates a few providers, including the classic react-redux provider. So now we can easily write stories that have useSelector and other R…</span>

Taking Mark&#x27;s instruction a bit further; to achieve drag&amp;drop in a bit more realistic situation, calling the store in a service asynchronously. To achieve this status, I stumbled on the .valueChanges(...) method.
The internal firestore documents explains the working of this .valueChanges(...) method as it listen to all documents in the retrieved collection and queries this list as an Observable.

.valueChanges({idField: &#x27;&lt;a-property-of-the-document&#x27;}) it means that the document ID (actually the document&#x27;s name) will be mapped to the provided property being one of the properties within the document-object.
Know the construction of the document, in this case document (ITask) &#x3D; { id?: string; title?:string; description?: string&#x27;; }. 

When calling the .valueChanges(...) method with a provided idField, which is set to one of the provided properties as stated, internally, the ID (actually the document&#x27;s name) of that document is mapped to the &#x27;provided&#x27;-property within the document object.

If you are feeling lucky, refer to this commit for full code
Step 1: Setting up the project
Download and install the latest stable version of Node

At the time of writing this post, the recommended version is 14.17.0




$ node --version
v14.17.0

Create a new directory for the service




mkdir tdsvc

Initialize a node application




cd tdsvc
npm init

Fill out the necessary project details to generate a  package.json

Set main to dist/index.js

Add start script in the scripts section




&quot;start&quot;: &quot;tsc &amp;&amp; node dist/index.js&quot;

Add &quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot; to enable ES5 modules

First step install Angular universal.
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine@next

Next step was set up the build in netlify
npm run build:ssr

The page is ready with server side render, but my client application need to request the articles, The TransferState service help to send information from the server to the client.
  imports: [
    BlogHeaderModule,
    BrowserModule,
    InfrastructureModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    BrowserModule.withServerTransition({ appId: &#x27;dw&#x27; }),
    TransferHttpCacheModule
  ],

Install it as part of the App module and import into  ServerTransferStateModule in server module.
@NgModule({
  imports: [AppModule, ServerModule, ServerTransferStateModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})

Done
Because my app is only text was easy to get more than 95% but keep in mind the following points.
Not all application are the same, my case is a simple blog, so not issues with images, or authentication.
Use https://contrastchecker.com/ and https://alex-page.github.io/sass-a11ycolor for accesibility issues.
If is your first time, try with an easy proyect like a blog or small app.
Take care about how to use or transfer data between components, I got an issue to send data using this.location.getState().

                    <span>A user is usually authenticated by entering a username, email address, and/or password and then being given access to various resources or services. By its very existence, authentication relies on maintaining the user&#x27;s state. This seems to go against HTTP&#x27;s fundamental property of being a stateless protocol.  
Your Angular app will communicate with a backend that generates tokens. The Angular app can then send the token to the backend as an Authorization header to show they&#x27;re authenticated. The JWT should be checked by the backend, and access should be granted based on its validity.

                    <span>Introduction


In this article, we will see some of the best practices to unsubscribe from subscriptions (aka Observables) and how to keep our code clean and nicely architectured avoiding memory leaks.
In a nutshell, we will use:
the async Angular build-in pipe
RxJS operators (e.g takeUntil)
custom array of subscriptions
the SubSink npm package
the @ngneat/until-destroy npm package
If you have experience in Angular, you already know that RxJS is one of the most powerful packages. It uses the concept of Observables to handle and work with asynchronous and event-based code. More specifically, Observable is an entity that emits multiple data values over time and asynchronously.
It sounds cool, right? Yes, it is cool and powerful, but you already know that!
What&#x27;s the problem with Observables …</span>

                    <span>In this digital era, the importance of customized web and mobile apps has increased significantly. But as competition intensifies, it is necessary for companies to come up with feature-rich apps to match world-class standards and attract more people. Therefore, if you want to develop an app from scratch, the website development company
needs to use a consistent software stack. All you need to have the right set of tools, resources, and a standardized development process to build a customized and user-friendly application.
MEAN stack is such a stack that can meet your business needs effectively while offering the benefits of advancing technology in customized web and mobile apps. MEAN acronym stands for MongoDB (a database), Express (backend framework), AngularJS (Front-end framework), and …</span>

                    <span>In Angular you have some great internationalisation (i18n) out of the box, which builds the nice compiled and minified bundle your used to. You have a compiled version per language. If you work with another framework which does the same thing (export a language per directory), this approach will work for you as well.
My problem: the separate directories give you nasty URL&#x27;s, something like whatwhat.app/en/. Okay, so that&#x27;s just looks but it can also be a problem with sharing links. For example when user A shares a link with user B, but they have different native languages it will be annoying that the opened link does not have the language correct language for the receiver.
In my case I wanted to make it a setting that the user can adjust, with a default language as a fallback. Easy to make…</span>

Some interesting features (esp. to Windows users):
Familiar desktop environment &amp; user experience to Windows and macOS users.
Possible to run many Windows apps (by using WineHQ).
It&#x27;s free and proudly open-source.
So if you are interested in Linux, I suggest trying Zorin OS alongside your current OS or in a virtual machine.
P.S. OnWorks lets you test various OSes online. It&#x27;s slow and time-limited but worth trying once.</span>

                    <span>Linux operating systems are powerful and can be used all around your home and office. Whether you switch to Linux full-time or use it alongside Windows and macOS, there are some things you should know.
1. Linux comes in distributions 😁
Linux and related software come in distribution. A Linux distribution is an operating system, while Linux is the code that makes the operating system work (the kernel).
These distributions have a different user experience and target. Some distributions are very beginner orientated while others are oriented towards the power user. There are many different Linux distributions 
Some of the more popular Linux distributions are Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora and Suse. Each Linux distribution has a different target audience, such as Kali which is very security orientated.

Quiz API is a simple HTTP REST API for technical quizzes including a wide variety of topics like: Linux, DevOps, Programming (PHP, JS, Python and etc.), Docker, 
It is free for developers and I&#x27;ve just released a beta version and started adding some cool questions!
As the Quiz API returns the output in a JSON format, I created a bash script that allows you to answer questions whenever you feel like directly via your terminal!

In order to be able to use the Quiz API bash script you need to have the following:

                    <span>Introduction


When I started coding Expressive Tea almost two years ago, it was just a tool to increase my laziness (as most engineers) avoid setting up a project on ExpressJS. I was thinking about combining a language that I started to learn (Typescript) and making easier a configuration for ExpressJS; by that moment, I did not know about NestJS, a very mature and fantastic Framework. I did not have a chance to research, just because I got the idea to start working in this new (at that moment) personal library.
In September 2019, that personal library turned into a microframework to help build server-side applications in NodeJS and use modern Javascript powered by Typescript. Also, one of the main goals is to make this compatible with all the express middleware and plugins available when…</span>

  The baseline project


This post assumes you are following along with the baseline project tutorial, but the concepts apply to any Typescript project.
User service


We now have a solid foundation for building an express server. Next, we will create a simple User service that will illustrate one possible architecture for implementing features in express. We are going to create a directory located at src/user that will contain all of the User-specific logic for our application:
src/
├─ user/
│  ├─ controller.ts
│  ├─ service.ts
│  ├─ repo.ts
│  ├─ types.ts
├─ util/
│  ├─ error.ts
│  ├─ load-config.ts
│  ├─ logger.ts
├─ app.ts

                    <span>Hello Coders 👋
This is my first attempt at writing a technical post. Hope you find it helpful.
Recently, I encountered a requirement where I had to extract all the zip files present inside a main zip file which had a random folder structure and any of the folders can have a zip file present inside it at any level.
Find Library for extracting
Extract the main zip file i.e demo.zip

Figure out a way to traverse the whole folder structure recursively
Then extract the .zip file whenever it is found.
extract-zip library used to extract the zip files.
It takes two input arguments source and target. 
source should be absolute path of the zip file, 
target is where the folder will get extracted.

  try {
    await extract(source, { dir: target });

Once logged into our account, in the services menu select the Lambda option.

It shows three different options, select &quot;Crear desde cero&quot; to create from scratch.

Inside the panel of the Lambda, go to the code section.
As we can see, the handler object is that returns the Lambda, so we must always export a handler.
exports.handler &#x3D; async (event) &#x3D;&gt; {
        // TODO implement
        const response &#x3D; {
                statusCode: 200,
                body: JSON.stringify(&#x27;Hello from Lambda!&#x27;),
        };
        return response;
};

Pass the function up, and down export the handler, in the end it&#x27;s the same but a little easier to understand. (The function is now assigned to the export handler).

There are way too many HTTP status codes. If you&#x27;re like me, you find it difficult to memorize these codes. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t usually use every HTTP status code out there. There are the common ones that people use often and we can limit our knowledge to just the ones we need.
It would have been great if we had only codes to remember but these codes have meanings (as far HTTP is concerned). So remembering the code only is not enough, we also have to remember what they mean and when to use them. The meanings given to these codes are standard meanings, so if we aim to develop APIs that follows the HTTP standard, it is imperative we use these codes appropriately else we end up creating APIs that others can&#x27;t understand or use.

If you are slightly into malware analysis you probably know about Intezer. One of the things I like the most about that tool is the ability of analyzing genes, meaning it compares already known malware strings and Libraries in order to determine if a sample is similar enough (considering the percentage of similarities).

  Intro 


Continuing on from my previous blog about website security week, we&#x27;re going to talk about Features and Permissions for websites.
These are set as headers on your site when it is served up.



The feature policy was introduced several years ago and allows you to limit the web features that your website and anything embedded including iframes can use.
This helps protect your users from anything running that shouldn&#x27;t be and accessing any web features that you didn&#x27;t intend.
Here are some of the most important features to enable/disable:
accelerometer
camera
geolocation
gyroscope
magnetometer
microphone
payment
usb
The full list can be found on Modzilla.

                    <span>Dear Coder,
Let’s talk about the person who matters the most in our field.
No, it’s not you (though you’re enduringly important to me, dear Coder).
I’m talking about the user.
I want the user to have a good user experience, so I build a model that inherits from AspNetCore’s IdentityUser. By doing this, I inherit a set of robust properties without having to write too much new code.
Let’s start with the User model:

In my ToonSpace project, I create a model named “ToonUser” and add some custom properties that IdentityUser doesn’t already cover, including:
FirstName
LastName
DisplayName
FullName
ImageData
ContentType

I also inherit the properties of IdentityUser by using the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity namespace and inheriting from Identity user when I name the class:

What properties does IdentityUser grant me access to? A lot.

With these properties appended to my ToonUser, I have the tools I need to allow users to register accounts and interact with my application.
In my data folder, I access my ApplicationDbContext file and inherit IdentityDbContext of type ToonUser.

Then I add the ToonUser to my Identity service, along with Default UI and DefaultTokenProviders.

Now I’m ready to scaffold Identity pages for user accounts. I add a Scaffolded Item in my Areas &gt; Identity folder and select “Identity.” 

I override all files and select ApplicationDbContext as my data context class. Once I add the scaffolded Identity pages, my Identity folder will be filled with boilerplate razor pages.

I access the code behind for the “register” view and add properties for First Name and Last Name because those properties are not the default with Identity pages. I also add fields to the View for the user to enter this information.

Now that I have registration pages scaffolded and augmented to fit my ToonUser model, users can register an account on my application.
I hope these letters find you well, dearest Coder.
Until next time, godspeed in your keystrokes.
Clickity Clacks,
Kasey</span>

                    <span>There’s a monumental cybersecurity shift happening in organizations across the country. Every day, companies are transforming their operations, adopting new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with technology to keep up in a highly competitive digital landscape. 
And with that change comes risk. 
There’s danger involved in dealing with data and peril in opening systems to the world. Access is risky too and everyday seems to bring more news of some kind of cyberattack. Implementing a cybersecurity program in your organization is an important first step in not only staying competitive but also combating cybersecurity threats, securing your organization’s data, and protecting profits.

                    <span>🔑 Biometrics are measurable human traits or characteristics that are often used in biometric authentication to verify a user’s identity for cybersecurity purposes.



  
  
  
Biometrics are measurable human traits, characteristics, or behaviors that can be used to verify a person&#x27;s identity. For example, a person&#x27;s face or fingerprints are unique to them and can be measured. So they&#x27;re often used to identify a person in law enforcement applications.
Biometrics have been used for identity verification since 1883 when French criminologist Alphonse Bertillon first used body measurements to identify repeat offenders. Today, biometric authentication is growing in popularity for enterprises because biometrics are an effective way to control access to sensitive information, devices, or physical locations.
However, biometrics aren&#x27;t impenetrable and come with increased privacy risks. So any organization seeking to utilize biometrics to verify employees or end users should pay close attention to how they implement biometric identification systems.
Below is what executives need to know about using biometrics for their organization.

                    <span>Summary


That short made me really troubled meanwhile😅
OS: OpenBSD 6.9
Web: OpenBSD httpd

App: PHP + PHP-FPM 
CMS: Drupal 9
I have installed Drupal 8/9 on OpenBSD several times.
Drupal admin panel has the function to look up &quot;Available update&quot; in &quot;Report&quot; pages.

Fig.1 Failed

  
  
  Solution


I found it was because of TLS connection failure, after struggling and being empowered by the official documentation:
Drupal - PHP OpenSSL requirements 
To fix it, place cacert.pem under chroot&#x27;s root and configure PHP aka php.ini.
First, get the certificate.
$ # /etc in &#x60;chroot&#x60; is &#x60;/var/www/etc&#x60; in actual
$ cd /var/www/etc

$ doas mkdir ssl
$ cd ssl

$ # get the cacert.pem
$ doas ftp https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem
$ doas chmod a-w cacert.pem

It looks like:
$ pwd
/var/www/etc/ssl
$ ls -l
total 448
-r--r--r--  1 root  daemon  206919 Apr 13 12:12 cacert.pem

Then, edit php.ini.
$ doas nvim /etc/php-7.4.ini

to add the line:
  [curl]
  ; A default value for the CURLOPT_CAINFO option. This is required to be an
  ; absolute path.   
  ;curl.cainfo &#x3D;
+ curl.cainfo &#x3D; &quot;/etc/ssl/cacert.pem&quot;

Finally, restart the PHP-FPM daemon.
$ doas rcctl restart php74_fpm

Happily, my site got the update information🙂

                    <span>Introduction


When I started coding Expressive Tea almost two years ago, it was just a tool to increase my laziness (as most engineers) avoid setting up a project on ExpressJS. I was thinking about combining a language that I started to learn (Typescript) and making easier a configuration for ExpressJS; by that moment, I did not know about NestJS, a very mature and fantastic Framework. I did not have a chance to research, just because I got the idea to start working in this new (at that moment) personal library.
In September 2019, that personal library turned into a microframework to help build server-side applications in NodeJS and use modern Javascript powered by Typescript. Also, one of the main goals is to make this compatible with all the express middleware and plugins available when…</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

                    <span>Vim is a text editor with a huge following. It&#x27;s installed by  default on every Linux system and even on Mac OS X.
Vim is a tool that wants you to succeed. if you want something to happen, you can make it happen. It works completely by keyboard shortcuts. 

It gives you the power to manipulate text at a fundamental level. you can operate on individual characters, words or lines of text this gives vim a really powerful interactive feel.
If you are new to vim, I recommend these exercises
I am often connecting to remote machines and editing config files. 
This was cumbersome, as I would have to use SFTP to copy files, manually updating the buffer when the file was modified on the remote machine. 
It was too easy to get distracted and lose track of what I was doing.
If you want to edit files on a remote server, try this command:
vim scp://you@remote_ip//path/file.txt

and change username to your username, your remote ip, the path and the filename.
vim scp://frank@192.168.2.7//home/frank/hello.txt

If you have vim open, you can also do :e scp://you@remote_ip//path/file.txt
You can use sftp too:
vim sftp://user@remote_ip//path/file

Change it with your username, remote ip and path to the file.
vim sftp://frank@192.168.2.7//home/frank/hello.txt

If you want to use the old unencrypted ftp protocol
:e ftp://[user@]machine/path/

Vim is relentlessly awesome. It does everything an editor should do and nothing it shouldn&#x27;t. There are no gimmicks, no silly settings, no bloat. It just works. all the time. no exceptions.</span>

                    <span>Are you tired of scanning images and trying to shrink them under 25 mbs just so you can send them via email ? Look no further, I am here to save you from this trouble. (that kinda rhymed.)
This basic shell script uses ghostscript to compress your scanned pdfs significantly. Just yesterday I scanned 100 pages of documents and it was over 90 mbs. I searched for a way to compress them under 25 mbs and voila. Here I was with only 6 mbs of pdfs. Much wow. Such compression.
Why we need it,
Fast.
Ez.
No need to go online. Especially no need to upload company top-secret documents to any website you see on the Internet.
Possible huge compression without notable loss.
Command usage:
./shrinkpdf.sh in.pdf out.pdf
ghostscript.





If you are in a situation exactly like me where there are 100 pdf files under one folder that you want to compress altogether, a simple for loop will suffice.
import os
import subprocess
import sys

infolder &#x3D; sys.argv[1]
outfolder &#x3D; &quot;compressed_&quot; + infolder
os.mkdir(outfolder)

for f in os.listdir(infolder):
    subprocess.run([&quot;./shrinkpdf.sh&quot;, os.path.join(infolder, f), os.path.join(outfolder, f)])

Run this python script,
python shrink.py pdfs/
and all of your pdfs will be put under compressed_pdfs/.

All the relevant details and more, inside. I humbly wanted to let you know such a useful tool exists.</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
