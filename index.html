                    <span>Hello all, In today&#x27;s blog, we are going to learn about policy as code in Kubernetes using Kyverno.  Let&#x27;s get started.
Policy as Code (PaC) is the idea of writing code in a high-level language to manage and automate policies. The DevOps team can adopt the best practices by representing policies as code, such as version control, automated testing, and automated deployment. You can use these policies in audit or enforcement mode to monitor existing workloads, services for misconfiguration or prevent the misconfigurations applying in the cluster. 
Policies could be established for multiple areas of your operational environments. You want your Kubernetes clusters to be reliable and secure and you want to control who has access to what. You also want to enforce rules for your kubernetes resour…</span>

  Introduction


In this series of articles, we are going to learn how to create generic models and services step-by-step regarding the CRUD feature of resources in Angular.
In a nutshell, we&#x27;re going to learn:
How to use generics in Typescript
What is CRUD operations in APIs
How to create generic models in Angular
How to create generic service for CRUD in Angular

                    <span>We all agreed about not manipulating data inside component or better to say presentation layer.
So I decided to put logout logic inside guard, this way I will be able to just call logout route and done!
For this I&#x27;ve configured my authentication module routes like this:
{
    path: &#x27;login&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false }
  },
  {
    path: &#x27;register&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: true }
  },
  {
    path: &#x27;logout&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false },
    canActivate: [LogoutGuard]
  }

I love to keep things as simple and low as possible 😁
For log out I&#x27;ve added canActivate field and passed the LogoutGuard, the guards have the ability to return UrlTree. It is awesome, let&#x27;s see how the guard implemented:
@Injectable()
export class LogoutGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {
  }

  canActivate(): UrlTree {
    this.store.dispatch(logout());
    return this.router.createUrlTree([&#x27;auth&#x27;, &#x27;login&#x27;]);
  }
}

That&#x27;s it!
The canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!
After this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.

Preloading is great. It lets us fetch parts of our application before it is even requested for. By doing this, our content is ready to be served when needed without any delay. There are many ways of doing this, I&#x27;ll be touching upon some of the ways to do this in Angular and how we can create our own custom preloading strategy based on the user&#x27;s network state.
Angular provides us with route-based preloading out of the box. There are two strategies namely PreloadAllModules and NoPreloading.
NoPreloading, as the name suggests does not preload any modules. This is the default behaviour.
PreloadAllModules, on the other hand, preloads all modules. A simple example adding a preloading strategy in a routing module file can be seen below
app.routing.module.ts

                    <span>When we use external libraries, it is very common to declare a global object and use it.  But the price to pay is get complex testing scenario, and of course global object like magic is not a “good practice”.
How I can tell to angular about provide an external library declared as global?
My example was using the leaflet library, using the InjectionToken class and @Inject.
If you want to read more about it. 
— https://angular.io/api/core/InjectionToken
https://angular.io/api/core/inject#usage-notes
Install the leaflet package and register into the angular.json to load the library.
npm install leaflet

Open the angular.json file and add leaflet.css and leaflet.js assets.

                    <span>Different rendering methods can alter how much of the rendering falls on to clients, the search engine’s bot requesting the page, or the user’s browser. Two of the most popular rendering methods are isomorphic rendering and dynamic rendering. 
Isomorphic rendering makes use of Universal JavaScript, as it renders on both client-side or server-side. Dynamic rendering, on the other hand, is often considered to be a workaround for social media crawlers or search engines that are not running on JavaScript. This rendering method is recommended by search engines like Google or Bing. 
Both these rendering methods have their specific advantages, so choosing between them can be a bit difficult. This guide will help you make decisions on how to render your website by discussing these rendering method…</span>

Effective IBM i modernization solutions allow you to optimize your enterprise, expand IT productivity, and reduce your overall ownership cost.
There are a few ways that a modernization project could be undertaken. For example, your developers could learn a new language (Java/.Net) provided you have the time and resources. Or you can go for the easy way out, rip out your IBM i, and replace it with something else.
While this might be your first thought for modernization, it is also time-consuming and super expensive to start afresh. Not just that, you&#x27;d be letting go of the ability to process safe, secure, and quick transactions.

🌟 Luckily, many people have had successful cloud migrations in the past, so a lot of the knowledge around how to go about hosting on AWS has been captured and shared.

                    <span>In some case, a pod can take a lot of time before being deleted.
So here is the Kubernetes command to force the deletion of a pod.
kubectl delete pod  --grace-period&#x3D;0 --force --namespace 
example
kubectl delete pod nginx-0fec982 --grace-period&#x3D;0 --force --namespace nginx

                    <span>We&#x27;ve been passing props to stateless functional components. These components act like pure functions. They accept props as input and return the same view every time they are passed the same props.
A stateless functional component is any function you write which accepts props and returns JSX. 
A stateless component, on the other hand, is a class that extends React.Component, but does not use internal state (covered in the next post).
A stateful component is a class component that does maintain its own internal state. You may see stateful components referred to simply as components or React components.
FreeCodeCamp now shows us the code editor thas a CampSite component that renders a Camper component as a child. They want us to define the Camper component and assign it default props of { name: &#x27;CamperBot&#x27; }. We can render any code that we want but it has to have a p element that includes only the name value that is passed in as a prop. We should define propTypes on the Camper component to require name to be provided as a prop and verify that it is of type string.




class CampSite extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      
 {
  return 
{props.name}
}
Camper.defaultProps &#x3D; {name: &#x27;CamperBot&#x27;}
Camper.propTypes &#x3D; { name: PropTypes.string.isRequired}

                    <span>Orchestration


Container orchestration is all about managing the life cycles of containers, especially in large, dynamic environments.
Container Orchestration can be used to perform a lot of tasks, some of them includes:
Provisioning and deployment of containers
Scaling up or removing containers to spread application load evenly
Movement of containers from one host to another if there is a shortage of resources
Load balancing of service discovery between containers
Health monitoring of containers and hosts
There are many container orchestration solutions which are available, some of the popular ones include:
Docker Swarm
Kubernetes
Apache Mesos
Elastic Container  Service (AWS ECS)
There are also various container orchestration platforms available like EKS.
Kubernetes (K8s) is and open-Source container Orchestration engine developed by Google.
It is originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

Things to configure while working with Kubernetes.



Sr No
Things to Install
Description




1
kubectl
CLI for running user commands against cluster


2
Kubernetes Master
Kubernetes Cluster by itself


3
Worker Node Agents
Kubernetes Node Agent



There are multiple ways to get started with fully functional k8s environment.
Use the Managed K8s Service
Use Minikube
Install &amp; Configure K8s Manually (Hard Way)
In this approach you have to install all the components ok K8s Individually

You have to just download kubectl and that&#x27;s it. As rest all the things are taken care by Managed Service. Download CLI and just need to connect with K8s master.
Environment Setup
Take care of K8s master also the worker node, then we need to configure the kubectl.

This is Part-1 of a 3 part series on how to proactively handle errors in your application across the stack.
As engineers, we toil all day, write tests, test our APIs manually, work through various scenarios and user flows before we raise a PR to get our code merged in. Peer Pull Request reviews - one of the best forms of collaboration, act as an extra set of eyes that help identify missing conventions and use cases. This helps build a more stable product. All these things are done to reduce the risk of failure. However, as all of you know, and have very well experienced, there will be unanticipated issues in production. Could be related to a third-party service malfunctioning,  or a system failure. Yes,  AWS goes down too!

A little bit about me. I&#x27;m a newcomer to the DevOps world and right now I try to understand what should I, as a junior DevOps, know and use to monitor IT infrastructure successfully.
My first major tasks sounded frightened to me at first. But, later, I understood that I just need to find the right solution that is accompanied by automation, so I can confidently rely on it. So, my goal was to find a SaaS to monitor a big IT ecosystem, prevent downtimes, analyze log data, etc.
I went through different blogs, forums, review websites, and the systems I came across everywhere were Datadog, New Relic, Zabbix, ELK, etc. Thanks to my team, we decided to test all of them and then decide which one is our favorite.
We started with Datadog. I can admit as a person, who doesn&#x27;t have a strong…</span>

I used AWS EC2 instance to demonstrate the idea with Ubuntu 20.04 on it.
This was made only for demonstration purpose, so to quickly setting up an OpenVPN server without pain I used angristan/openvpn-install script to do so.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angristan/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh

                    <span>Transferring files to servers is a vital task in most software developers&#x27; life. Usually, we use protocols like FTP (File Transfer Protocol), FTPS, SFTP to transfer files. In this tutorial, we are going to briefly discuss the available protocols and their differences. Also, the tutorial will explain how to transfer files from client to server, server to client and server to server using SCP.
FTP is an old and insecure protocol that can be used to transfer files between local networks or computers connected through the Internet. However, FTP is not recommended to use to transfer files over the Internet anymore as it transfers usernames and passwords in cleartext. In addition to that, FTP provides an anonymous method that let you transfer files even without a username and password.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve slowly adding more and more lua functions into my neovim configuration,





  
  
  Telegraph.nvim


Check out the project readme
I want a simple way to make remaps into shell commands that can open new tmux
For example I want to make remaps to do things like open the current file in lookatme.
# vim :terminal
nnoremap s Telegraph pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark

# tmux session
nnoremap s lua require&#x27;telegraph&#x27;.telegraph({cmd&#x3D;&#x27;pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark&#x27;, how&#x3D;&#x27;tmux&#x27;})

# tmux popup
nnoremap S lua require&#x27;telegraph&#x27;.telegraph({cmd&#x3D;&#x27;pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark&#x27;, how&#x3D;&#x27;tmux_popup&#x27;})

The main goal here is that remaps become one liners that can just be put
init.vim without creating a whole new lua module for each
telegraph takes in a how argument to determine where to tun the command.j
term(default) runs command in the built in terminal
tmux runs command in a new tmux session and joins it.
tmux_popup runs command in a tmux popup window.
tmux_popup_session runs command in a tmux session and displays it in a popup
subprocess runs command in a subprocess
The current set of format strings that can be used with telegraph.  Placing
{} within your command will get rendered into something with
cword - the current word under the cursor
cWORD - the current BIG Word under the cursor
cline - the current line under the cursor
filepath - the filepath of the current file
filename - the filename of the current file
parent - the parent directory of the current file
current_session_name - name of the current tmux session
cwd - the current working directory
Check out the repo and give
it a star if its something that interests you.</span>

                    <span>After years of writing a multichannel notification management systems from scratch for every project i&#x27;ve been involved with. Me and my partner in crime Tomer Barnea decided to solve this thing once and for all and created the opensource library called Notifire.
Are main goal is to abstract the heavy lifting of managing notifications in code, provide a single API to work with all communication providers (Email, SMS, InApp, Push). 
And later help with: Timezone awareness, priority, channel selection, templating, subscription management, in app widgets and etc...
Would to hear your thoughts about the API and library. Any help will be appreciated.

                    <span>The first two parts of this series were focused on desiging the user interface of my new side project called Bioledger. The first step was hand-sketching the UI elements on a sketchpad. The sketches don’t look great but they did give me a clear plan for what I needed to create on the screen. The second step was to translate those hand sketches into a digital version that gave me a representation of what the final project would look like on a mobile device. Figma and its community-built tools made that process relatively easy. Now I have some solid reference points for beginning the actual development process. I feel good about where I am in the process so far but a couple of things have changed from my original plan. Let’s take a look at the original outline from part 1:

It is often said that in programming there&#x27;s always more than one way of doing things. The maxim is that to grow we must be open to new ideas...new ways of doing things. 
In this second piece of implementing events and mailing in Adonis, I&#x27;ll demonstrate another technique we can use to capture different events in our applications.
A reminder that the entire source code for this project can be found here.
For this guide, we&#x27;ll use the built-in Event emitter module that comes in AdonisJs. You can peruse the official event documentation to have a better understanding of this concept.

variables are an important part of the programming language. In general, variables are ways of storing data(value).
variable names can only include letters, numbers, underscore(_), dollar sign($).
variable names cannot start with a number.
variable names are case sensitive. Meaning, letter &quot;a&quot; is considerably different from the letter &quot;A&quot;.
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords e.g function) cannot be used as variable names.

Peer Pull Request reviews - one of the best forms of collaboration, act as an extra set of eyes that help identify missing conventions and use cases. This helps build a more stable product. All these things are done to reduce the risk of failure. However, as all of you know, and have very well experienced, there will be unanticipated issues in production.

                    <span>File System in Nodejs


The fs module in nodejs allows you to read, delete, update, and create files on your machine, it gives you access to do anything you want with the files. There are several methods within the module that allows you to do this. Allow me walk you through the process.
The cover image was sourced from here
Obviously, you must have nodejs installed on your machine. After which you should import the fs module.
const fs &#x3D; require(&#x27;fs&#x27;);

All of the operations of the fs module can be done either synchronously or asynchronously. 
The synchronous form blocks the Node.js event loop and further JavaScript execution until the operation is complete. Exceptions are thrown immediately and can be handled using try…catch, or can be allowed to bubble up.

                    <span>Hi Developers,
We are developing a new developer tool to create a project template. You know react and RN has a lot of node modules. Also, these modules have a lot of versions. That&#x27;s why developers generally got build errors or run time errors when adding a new package in a project.
Because of that, we are creating this project template tool. You select a language and select a version of the language then add dependencies from the node module. 
The depZARD creates a project template with a compatible running node package with available node modules.So you will have a project template with the compatible node modules you want to use.
I have shared the link of DepZARD&#x27;s details below. Please subscribe and  support us :)

Add webpack and its relevant packages to your project.

Then we learned about CSS to make our websites prettier and visually satisfying. When it was time to make our websites interactive and dynamic, we started diving into the amazing world of JavaScript. But back in the day, JS was used just to code the client-side, meaning that it could only be used in the browser. To interact with the server we needed to use other server-side languages such as Python, Ruby, or PHP. Until Node was born.
But, what is Node and how does it work? Node is a runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript on a physical machine, rather than in the browser. At the same time, it is open-source, whereby millions of developers can create libraries and modules th…</span>

From companies to consumers, we believe everyone has a responsibility to make technology as secure as possible. For Auth0, this means building secure processes, technology, tools, and a culture of trust that puts people at the center. So this year we want you to join us for our first-ever custom Capture The Flag (CTF) with Hack The Box from October 18th to October 25th.
A CTF or Capture The Flag is a cybersecurity competitive game where you have to solve or hack different types of challenges to gain access to a string -the flag- which looks something like this: HTB{m1_f1rst_fl4g}
You enter that flag into Hack The Box and get points depending on the difficulty of the challenge. The team w…</span>

                    <span>Hello all!
A little bit about me. I&#x27;m a newcomer to the DevOps world and right now I try to understand what should I, as a junior DevOps, know and use to monitor IT infrastructure successfully.
My first major tasks sounded frightened to me at first. But, later, I understood that I just need to find the right solution that is accompanied by automation, so I can confidently rely on it. So, my goal was to find a SaaS to monitor a big IT ecosystem, prevent downtimes, analyze log data, etc.
I went through different blogs, forums, review websites, and the systems I came across everywhere were Datadog, New Relic, Zabbix, ELK, etc. Thanks to my team, we decided to test all of them and then decide which one is our favorite.
We started with Datadog. I can admit as a person, who doesn&#x27;t have a strong…</span>

                    <span>Setting up a django project is an expertise worthy of mastery. This is pretty important because; lousiness can be permitted and forgiven, whilst developing locally. However, you would definitely pay dearly, if an attacker should trail your backend-system. This trailing becomes feasible, due to the fact that; confidential variables e.g SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, STATIC_URL, MEDIA_URL or some confidential link etc, required to be kept secret; in a .env file, was mistakenly loosed in the production code. A single link being exposed, can give an idea into several other links or services, to an experienced attacker (cracker). Hence, a proper project setup, is of utmost priority, from the inception of the project. A great advantage to this, is that once setup, it becomes very easy to make referen…</span>

                    <span>Why worry about software supply chain security while deploying containers?


In the past few years, we have seen attacks such as NotPetya and Sunburst, which has shifted the industry’s focus to secure their supply chain. With the growing usage of Open source software, we inherit many third-party dependencies into our application. An upstream vulnerability in one of your dependencies can affect your application, making it susceptible to a potential compromise. A software supply chain is anything that goes into or affects your code from development, through your CI/CD pipeline, until it gets deployed into production. 
The first step in getting supply chain security right is to start with visualizing the supply chain components which you use from scratch. You can use something like Dependency…</span>

                    <span>When you start building your cloud infrastructure, security might not be a top priority as much as getting your project up and running. This might lead you to delay security considerations for later and end up having an insecure cloud environment for a long period of time. The more this is put off, the more difficult and expensive it is going to be to fix this. In worst cases, it might be necessary to re-architect your environment. Worse yet if you do have a security attack, it will cost you considerably more money and effort to respond to these threats. In some cases, external incident response teams have to be brought in and making them do this work is exponentially more expensive.

  What is the Caesar Cipher?


The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The number of fixed positions down the alphabet is what we call the key. It was named after Julius Caesar since he was the one who invented it.
So as I said earlier on, each letter during encryption is moved some fixed positions down the alphabet. So for a key of 3, if we are to encipher the letter A, we will shift it down three characters and the results will be D, C would be F and so on...

As mentioned previously, Typescript is a superset of Javascript, so we are able to access JS&#x27;s primitive types available in JS. 
string - anything enclosed in  &#x27; &#x27;  or  &quot; &quot;
number - any number value
boolean - a value of true or false


null - an absence of value

                    <span>While TypeScript is a godsend for React developers, its syntax is fairly intimidating to newcomers. I think generics are a big part of that: they look weird, their purpose isn&#x27;t obvious, and they can be quite hard to parse.
This article aims to help you understand and demystify TypeScript generics in general, and their application to React in particular. They aren&#x27;t that complex: if you understand functions, then generics aren&#x27;t that far off.
To understand generics, we&#x27;ll first start by comparing a standard TypeScript type to a JavaScript object.
// a JavaScript object
const user &#x3D; {
  name: &#x27;John&#x27;,
  status: &#x27;online&#x27;,
};

// and its TypeScript type
type User &#x3D; {
  name: string;
  status: string;
};

As you can see, very close. The main difference is that in JavaScript you care about the v…</span>

                    <span>We all agreed about not manipulating data inside component or better to say presentation layer.
So I decided to put logout logic inside guard, this way I will be able to just call logout route and done!
For this I&#x27;ve configured my authentication module routes like this:
{
    path: &#x27;login&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false }
  },
  {
    path: &#x27;register&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: true }
  },
  {
    path: &#x27;logout&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false },
    canActivate: [LogoutGuard]
  }

I love to keep things as simple and low as possible 😁
For log out I&#x27;ve added canActivate field and passed the LogoutGuard, the guards have the ability to return UrlTree. It is awesome, let&#x27;s see how the guard implemented:
@Injectable()
export class LogoutGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {
  }

  canActivate(): UrlTree {
    this.store.dispatch(logout());
    return this.router.createUrlTree([&#x27;auth&#x27;, &#x27;login&#x27;]);
  }
}

That&#x27;s it!
The canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!
After this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.

Preloading is great. It lets us fetch parts of our application before it is even requested for. By doing this, our content is ready to be served when needed without any delay. There are many ways of doing this, I&#x27;ll be touching upon some of the ways to do this in Angular and how we can create our own custom preloading strategy based on the user&#x27;s network state.
Angular provides us with route-based preloading out of the box. There are two strategies namely PreloadAllModules and NoPreloading.
NoPreloading, as the name suggests does not preload any modules. This is the default behaviour.
PreloadAllModules, on the other hand, preloads all modules. A simple example adding a preloading strategy in a routing module file can be seen below
app.routing.module.ts

                    <span>Continuing on typescript, let&#x27;s know why typescript is needed.Major two reasons are:
Static Type checker
Tooling
Imagine what happens when we run the following code in JS
function greet(person, date) {
    console.log(&#x60;Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!&#x60;);
}
greet(&quot;Abhirup&quot;);

It will throw a typeerror !!
console.log(&#x60;Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!&#x60;); 
                                              ^
TypeError: Cannot read property &#x27;toDateString&#x27; of undefined

Why?  Because the date param of greet is undefined and so toDateString of undefined throws error.But we got to know of this error while running only.
Now if we paste the same code in the .ts file.

It means first class support of typescript by the popular IDEs and code editors.

Next.js allows you to register redirects using redirects function inside next.config.js


Nuxt.js allows you to register redirects using redirect-module in nuxt.config.js


Universal allows you to register redirects at server engine router level. e.g. @nguniversal/express-engine



But in all the cases when your app is served, it should stay on top of a nodejs server to handle all the requests.
But I want my application to be a static served application that lives only on client, without a server 😢

                    <span>I recently had the honor of working with a neighbor beginning his development journey. He is taking a course through his employer and using a work computer with Windows installed.
Initially, I saw that he was using Git Bash ... mostly unsuccessfully. In particular, the Angular CLI was failing with command not found. He apparently had figured out some creative npx commands.
I wanted something simpler for him.
Knowing he had NodeJS installed, we set the path to the Angular CLI and made a custom shortcut to the NodeJS Command Prompt.
We followed the rabbit hole and found the Angular CLI in the following location ...
C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\@angular\cli

Then, we opened the Environment Variables and added this to the Path. This ensures that we are able to reference the CLI in the command prompt later.


Then, we located the NodeJS Command Prompt shortcut ...
C:\Program Files\nodejs

We then copied the shortcut and placed it on the desktop to make things a bit easier.
The biggest change we made to the shortcut was to set the &quot;Start In&quot; folder to the root of his projects folder ... we got to these settings by Right-Clicking and selecting Properties.

This simple setup gave him much more flexibility without any hassles for Angular development using the CLI.</span>

Angular is one type of framework that is used for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript.
Nowadays, Angular is the most preferable front-end framework. Mostly, it is used in developing web apps. To better understand angular, one must have knowledge about how browser work and the security of angular projects. Web Security is also important to protect a site from security attacks and data theft. Now, we talk about some important practices which help us avoid security vulnerabilities in our Angular project/application.

Se servimos arquivos estáticos, pra que diabos a gente precisa subir um servidor?

                    <span>Monitoring services is a big part of Cloud Infrastructure Management.  Here we will go through one way to install Prometheus on Ubuntu and make pretty dashboards with Grafana on a separate machine.
Go grab this download and extract to start:
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.11.1/prometheus-2.11.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

tar -xvzf prometheus-2.11.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

cd prometheus/

./prometheus

Should be great success:

Open a web browser and head over to the http://{IP}:9090/graph



Let&#x27;s run it as a service, create this file:
/etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service

And give it this basic text settings:

                    <span>As we were developing more features and scaling the product, our data guy was more confused with the changes on DB and wanted to catch up with the migrations that we were doing.
So I thought why not just let him know in Slack if there&#x27;s a new DB migration every time that we release to production?
It should be easy right? We&#x27;re using Prisma as our DB driver so any changes on the DB are tracked with schema.prisma file and we just deploy to production when we merge a PR to master branch on GitHub. So I just need to know when a PR gets merged if there&#x27;s a change in the schema.prisma file, if so, then I can call Slack API and notify our data guy that we&#x27;re having a new migration.
