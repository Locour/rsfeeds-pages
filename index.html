2) For Library authors earlier it is recommended to use enableIvy: false which now not doable as we have no Ivy but we have other option compilationMode: &quot;partial&quot; so they both are same?
3) If a new library is published with angular version 13. then can it be consumed in an application which is non-ivy?

                    <span>How to create sticky columns in Angular using directives. Implementing tables with sticky columns can be tricky especially when you have to make multiple columns sticky. Using directives, we can easily implement sticky columns.
I can&#x27;t emphasize more the power of directives in Angular. I&#x27;ve written a couple of articles showcasing how one can actually use it to implement really cool stuff. You can check some use-cases for directives here:  Angular Directive Showcase.

We make use of the position: sticky CSS property to make an element sticky. Read more about sticky positioning at  MDN.
.sticky {
  position: sticky;
  left: 0;
}

For the sticky position to work properly, at least one of top, right, bottom, or left should be specified.
Making the first column in a table sticky is super simple…</span>

InterSystems IRIS 2019 is going to introduce new and exciting features. One of the areas with new interesting must-to-know things is the API Management. 
OpenAPI initiative (https://www.openapis.org/) is the organization supporting a standard specification to define APIs (https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification). The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Simila…</span>

  What is Open edX® ?


Open edX is an open-source platform you can use to create and host online courses. It was originally developed in 2012 by MIT and Harvard University and has since been adopted by organizations of all shapes and sizes to power a wide range of online learning use cases.
We use Ansible to provision and maintain our platform. If you are not familiar with Ansible, it&#x27;s an open source Devops tool that automates the software provisioning and configuration. It building blocks are:
Ansible Playbooks which has 1 or multiple roles. Imaging Playbook as full instructions on how to install your software, it&#x27;s components and how the set them up to work properly.

Technology tasks range from mission critical to mundane, but all of them are important to at least one key stakeholder in your business. The average IT department has more on it’s plate than your Grandma’s Thanksgiving feast:

New server acquisition and implementation

Docker has quickly become an essential platform for application containerization. By empowering developers to rapidly deploy apps and host them in the cloud, Docker has simplified the dev cycle by expediting the process of building scalable, modern applications.
Docker Compose
Compose For Local Development
Docker Compose takes the convenience of containers one step further, by streamlining each service’s building and runtime config into a single process. With Compose, it’s as simple as:
Define how to build your app’s services with a 
Dockerfile
Define how to run your app’s services in the 
docker-compose.yaml
Build and run your app with docker-compose up
Compose also allows devs to configure mount volum…</span>

                    <span>Sometimes coverage badge is not updating at all and remains at the same value as it was in the past.
If you search in your setup of Gitlab and find a «blocked» pipeline — exactly this type of pipeline is the main reason for coverage score staling.
my-job:
    when: manual

To fix this you need to add only one line:
my-job:
    when: manual
    allow_failure: true

And poof, you get lucky, your coverage badge is free of the evil witch curse and updates as it should.
Recently Gitlab guys fixed that behavior. How exactly? Just added default value allow_failure: true for manual pipelines automatically. This is a very good decision, because otherwise, a single manual step may ruin the whole CI/CD prosperity of your project.
my-job:
    when: manual
    allow_failure: false

and poof once again — you are stuck with never-ever updating coverage badge. The fix is obvious — add «true» for allow_failure or strip this line. But I have no answer to a simple question: what we should do if we need manual pipelines with disabled failure option and updatable coverage badge? Probably, this question should be addressed directly to Gitlab.
This may not be so easy to grasp from official documentation, so I decided to write this article. I hope it helped.</span>

Containers are not a fad. They’re never overkill for any project and they simplify many aspects of development, even when running locally. With a wide selection of relevant tools and resources, there has never been a better time than now to implement containers in your organization and get ahead of the curve.
What Are Containers?
Aren’t Containers Just For Larger Organizations?
What Can I Use Containers For?
Benefits Of Containerization
Since containers are designed to run alongside other containers, you can work on smaller aspects and microservices of a project while holding other containers constant. This also makes it easy to test a project with varying combinations of containers.

                    <span>The global influx of digital transformation is creating pressure on infrastructure. All the while, threat actors are continually improving their attack techniques. If there is a vulnerability to be found, it will be exploited. 
This is why many teams are shifting security to the left, even going as far as evolving their dev methodology from DevOps to DevSecOps.
Developers still have remaining concerns, most of which focus on release time. However, you should not have to compromise fast releases in favor of security. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a question of either/or.
In this article, you will learn about four methods that you can take advantage of to secure your React apps quickly. These are simple security practices that should not interrupt your workflow.

                    <span>What is CAP (Consistency, Availability or Partition Tolerance) Theorem And Distributed Data ? I got this q in an interview a few years ago and so better learn more about it. It will help you understand why some cloud DBs using strong consistency and some can only do eventual consistency! Thanks to #coachroachlabs Jim Walker for this good talk and help us understand more in the challenges to ensuring consistent distributed data, how to deal with network failures, dropped messages, RAFT, MVCC, etc...

                    <span>Integration tests are challenging in a standard application. They&#x27;re even more challenging in a decoupled, asynchronous environment. If you&#x27;re running them in a pipeline, you have to figure out all of the resource ARNs and make sure you have permission to access each of them. Also, what happens if your integration tests fail? Do you send a notification so someone can manually redeploy the previous version?
Running integration tests in a CloudFormation custom resource simplifies a few of these issues. You can use references to other resources in the stack to get the required ARNs. You can use those same references to build execution rules for the integration test. Finally, if the integration tests fail, then CloudFormation will automatically roll back the deployment.

Dockerfile.
🧠 Remember that a Docker image has a read-only filesystem based on layers which works as a template to start containers in a preinstalled environment, and a Docker container uses this &quot;template&quot; to run isolated applications into a virtualized run-time environment with a normal filesystem.
No, you can run commands with other users using the Dockerfile as well. You can see an example here.
When you are testing a random software within a container you might need to publish a port on the host OS, or into another computer. In this case you can&#x27;t add a forwarding port rule to an already existing container, so here is when docker commit comes to save us:
$ docker commit my_container my_image
$ docker run -p 8080:80 -it my_image

Now we can access to the port 80 in the container using http://localhost:8080 in the host OS.
docker commit can also be used to attach new volumes to the container.
Remember that it&#x27;s a good practice to keep your Docker images as minimalist as possible. Also the reproducible way to create and ship images is the Dockerfile.

You can monitor your express application using OpenTelemetry and a tracing backend of your choice. OpenTelemetry is the leading open-source standard under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation that aims to standardize the process of instrumentation across multiple languages.

This got me thinking... is Linux better for development? 
Do you use Linux for development? What do you develop? How has the experience been for you? What is your best advice for someone to get into developing in Linux? Are there distros to try out? Are there distros to avoid? Why did you move to Linux from MacOS or Windows?
I welcome all comments, questions, and suggestions! I may even turn this into a series where I try out Linux and report my findings.</span>

Now you realize I need to navigate to a directory inside another directory that is inside another. The chain continues for about 4-5 directories until you reach the required folder.
Such a mood spoiler, right! This potential move has the tendency to force you to get up from your desk and take a 5-minute break which can very quickly turn into a long break. 
See, the damaging domino effect it can have? Now you will argue, ah! You don&#x27;t know, I can keep pressing the &quot;up&quot; arrow and find the command I need because I used it just about a few hours ago.

                    <span>I am an IT student with diploma in computer engineering and currently perusing my bachelors, I have been using windows from the day i saw a computer for the first time in my life.
i was a windows user for 11 years, recently switched to Linux Mint..
The Good.
the way WIFI connects within seconds contrary to windows make me literally drool.
like some times my laptop would be in sleep the whole night and as soon at i wake it in the morning it already would be connected to the WIFI
on the contrary windows takes 69 years to connect
software installation process with terminal was super straight forward, i loved it.
your imagination is the limit when it comes to customization
UI is ❤️😩 (or maybe windows UI is just too shitty)
The Bad
No Photoshop, No Office, No Vegas Pro
yes there are alternatives, like libreoffice, Gimph..
i hate them, they suck.
libreoffice works but best of luck with the formatting of files your friend sent you
random freezes, my laptop used to just freeze, nothing worked... tried everything under the sun to recover from this stuck phase and preventing it, even mad it to mint forums, nothing... only solution once there was to hard reboot.
poor software updates, third party software updates matter because the come baring bug fixes, third party software like slack, quickdock, even whatsaap for desktop, all plagued with bugs.
this one is not that significant but the booting time in Linux was a bit higher than the windows counterpart, not that noticeable in the long run but coming from windows immediately it caught my attention.
anywho, i came back into loving arms of windows in about two months into my Linux journey, do i regret it, No.
would i install Linux again, No.
do i feel line one os is superior than other, No.</span>

                    <span>Today I will show you how to install Docker in Linux Mint and Ubuntu. Docker is a very useful tool which every developer should know. Using Docker you can run many applications with special containers. They are beside your system. For instance you code in php and you need php in your system to run application. With Docker you can install and run many versions of php. Let’s start!
First of all we should update the package lists:
sudo apt-get update

Next we have to install dependencies:
sudo apt-get -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

Perhaps you have installed all dependencies. After installing dependencies we have to add GPG key:
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

and repository:
sudo add-apt-repository &quot;deb [arch&#x3D;amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release; echo &quot;$UBUNTU_CODENAME&quot;) stable&quot;

When we add a new repository we have to remember to update package lists. So one more time we run sudo apt-get update .
Then we can install Docker in Linux Mint and Ubuntu (we install also docker-compose):
sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose

After installing Docker we have to add our user to a docker group:
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

It is necessary in order to run Docker without root privileges (without sudo). In my opinion running Docker with sudo is not a good idea. Remember restart machine after adding your user to group!
We can check our installation:
docker -v
docker-compose -v
docker run hello world

You should see the version of docker and docker-compose.

I wrote a shell script which install Docker in Linux Mint and Ubuntu automatically:
You can get it on my GitHub.
You can see tutorial on YouTube.</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s five years of introducing myself as a Debian user in the OS world. But I have full respect for Windows as well. Well, my dad uses Windows, but that&#x27;s not the reason you should hate Windows OS.
Microsoft Windows is with us from the start of OS development, from 1985. But this is also not the reason you shouldn&#x27;t hate Windows.
The only reason I am stuck on Linux/Debian OS is that it is good enough to fulfil my requirements. Similarly, many people are stuck in Windows because it is good enough to fulfil their requirements. 
Well, one of my college friends tried Linux, he search for a piece of software to do some writing stuff, he got LibreOffice, and tried it. FOR HIM, LibreOffice wasn&#x27;t good enough. I told him to use Google Docs as well, but at the end of the day, it didn&#x27;t match with him.
Also, he was a Valorant player friend. He search how to install Valorant in Linux? And guess what, he got disappointed, Valorant isn&#x27;t playable in Linux, aka: BANNED
So, we need to keep in mind that if something fulfils our requirement why one should change he/her workflow.
In a nutshell, we all want our tasks to be accomplished as soon as possible. If something we currently own and does the task we want without any issue, we&#x27;re good to go with it.

Reactive programming provides advanced data flows with the ability to create and manipulate event streams in a predictable manner.
This article will teach Node.js developers how to apply reactive programming in Node as well as its benefits and trade-offs.
The following will be covered in this article:
 Fundamentals of reactive programming
 Why consider reactive programming in Node.js?
 When to use the reactive programming approach
 Benefits of reactive programming
 Drawbacks of reactive programming
 Introducing orchestration and its benefits/trade-offs

Schema
A description of the shape a unit of data should undertake. So for a house isn&#x27;t the data, but a description of what the data of a house should look like.

const mongoose &#x3D; require(&quot;mongoose&quot;)

const houseSchema &#x3D; new mongoose.Schema({

Schema
If we want to manage a collection of documents (a bunch of items) of this datatype we then declare a model. This creates a collection and becomes the conduit to add, update, delete and retrieve data from the collection.

                    <span>One of the most important features during application development is the ability to debug your code easily. Because of the asynchrnous nature, a standard Node.js application server works single-threaded by default. When you are developing applications using an IDE like Visual Studio Code, you can very easily debug your Node.js process:
First, download the free Visual Studio Code IDE (@code) and install it on your development machine.
We will start with basic debugging using a very small test.js file and go to the debug view:

You&#x27;ll notice we need to define a debug configuration first (at the top, click on &quot;No configurations&quot; and select &quot;Add configuration&quot;. You&#x27;ll see a &quot;launch.json&quot; file is created and select &quot;Node.js: launch program&quot;:

                    <span>Yep we are creating a URL expander not a URL shortener


 
bitly, shorturl etc. through which we can convert our long and messy URL into a short and better looking URL. For example https://www.youtube.com/c/AngleBrace can become shorturl.at/asIW4.
So we can get the original long URL from the short URL using it.
Well some bad guy can take this virus download link eg. https://www.badsite.com/virus.exe and shorten it to https://shorturl.at/wDPZ5. And now just by seeing the short URL you won&#x27;t be able to tell that this link downloads a virus. So sometimes to prevent viruses and inappropriate websites we can use a URL Expander.

So I took the plunge and read the article, to my horror the article was really a messy piece of writing. That is littered with a jigsaw puzzle of tech projects in Singapore to frame a narrative that Singapore is a surveillance state. While bashing local tech community efforts like better.sg in the good work they had done.

When you&#x27;re adding authorization to an application, there are two crucial questions:
Are users that shouldn&#x27;t have access actually out?
Are users that should have access actually in?
If you can&#x27;t answer with certainty both questions, how can you claim to have a secure application? This is something that you can test manually, but a better alternative is test automation. Concretely, I think the best methodology to get there is using Test-Driven Development (TDD).
This piece is about adding authorization to a Ruby on Rails API by following TDD. You can check out this article to learn in detail how to secure a Rails API with Auth0. Also, you can follow this article along with this repository.

                    <span>The global influx of digital transformation is creating pressure on infrastructure. All the while, threat actors are continually improving their attack techniques. If there is a vulnerability to be found, it will be exploited. 
This is why many teams are shifting security to the left, even going as far as evolving their dev methodology from DevOps to DevSecOps.
Developers still have remaining concerns, most of which focus on release time. However, you should not have to compromise fast releases in favor of security. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a question of either/or.
In this article, you will learn about four methods that you can take advantage of to secure your React apps quickly. These are simple security practices that should not interrupt your workflow.

                    <span>THE EXPERIMENT: JAVASCRIPT SOURCE CODE SECURITY TESTING TOOLS


To begin our experiment, we chose 1,000 Javascript projects on GitHub that were recently updated and had between 50 and 200 stars in rating. Next, we went to UpWork.com and paid non-professionals £5/hour to use the Uleska Platform to automatically run three Javascript source code security testing tools. We consolidated the results generated by the platform to the project teams and made sure they didn’t have security or programming skills.
We didn’t set up any of our cyber value-at-risk enumerations, as they would apply to how an open-source library is used within the end-user application (i.e. types of data processed, quantity of data, environment etc.).
We also made the decision not to triage the results, as the Uleska Platfo…</span>

                    <span>(caption: Mrs. Tedesco writing a Todo Application in React with hooks)
It happens when we write useEffect hooks. We intend to just run some code when X changes, but then ESLint tells us to add Y and Z to the dependency list.
useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  setCount(count + 1)
  // eslint-disable-next-line
}, [])

Ignoring this rule is very bad. It opens up our code to a class of weird bugs (ex: count gets a value from the past). But most importantly, it hides bad design in other parts of the component.
I can strongly claim that EVERY useEffect can be made compliant with the ESLint rule while still mantaining the desired behavior. The solutions might not be straightforward, but it is always better to change other parts of the code than to add the rule. The overal benefit will be more consistent code.

                    <span>How to create sticky columns in Angular using directives. Implementing tables with sticky columns can be tricky especially when you have to make multiple columns sticky. Using directives, we can easily implement sticky columns.
I can&#x27;t emphasize more the power of directives in Angular. I&#x27;ve written a couple of articles showcasing how one can actually use it to implement really cool stuff. You can check some use-cases for directives here:  Angular Directive Showcase.

We make use of the position: sticky CSS property to make an element sticky. Read more about sticky positioning at  MDN.
.sticky {
  position: sticky;
  left: 0;
}

For the sticky position to work properly, at least one of top, right, bottom, or left should be specified.
Making the first column in a table sticky is super simple…</span>

We are doing this for a couple of reasons all of which have to do with improving the developer experience. Now that we are slowly merging the first parts of this migration we would love to share some insights into why we didn&#x27;t just go with TypeScript in the first place and why we have decided that the time was right now.
Before working full-time on Medusa we did agency work for a handful of different e-commerce clients; one of them wanted to migrate away from their solution back then and when we couldn&#x27;t find a new suitable platform for them we agreed to build a custom solution from scratch.

                    <span>A JavaScript superset, that builds up on JavaScript language, It adds new features to JavaScript, typescript cant run in the browser or even in NodeJS therefore it has a compiler that  compiles typescript to JavaScript. Added features in typescript include the use of types, it also helps us be more explicit and clearer about our code.
Lets look at two code snippets one with Plain Javascript and another in typescript .
Plain Javascript
  let inputA &#x3D; 1
  let inputB &#x3D; 2
  function sum(inputA, inputB){
     console.log(inputA + inputB)
  }
  sum(inputA,inputB)
  //this will return 3
  //Now what if we change the inputs to be
  inputA &#x3D; &quot;1&quot;
  inputB &#x3D; &quot;2&quot;
  sum(inputA,inputB)
 //this will return 12

Despite the second answer being wrong, we dont get an error notification at run time. Here is when typescript comes in with its additional type feature that guarantees we get the correct answer or an error.In typescript this would be written as(you can test this code in the TS playground):
    let inputA &#x3D; 1
    let inputB &#x3D; 2
    funtion sum(inputA: number,inputB: number){
     console.log(inputA + inputB)
    }
    sum(inputA,inputB)
    //prints 3
    //Now what if we change the inputs to be
    inputA &#x3D; &quot;1&quot;
    inputB &#x3D; &quot;2&quot;
    sum(inputA,inputB)
    //script.ts(6,9): error TS2345: Argument of type &#x27;string&#x27; is not assignable to parameter of type &#x27;number&#x27;.


Through the introduction of types in typescript, it easier to write more intuitive code. I will be writing a series of tutorial on typescript.
I will cover:

Classes &amp; Interfaces
Advanced Typescript features such as Generics &amp; Decorators

So, why not visit the Italian one and meet several known and impressive people from the dev community :-)
AngularDay


This Italian Angular international conference was organized by GrUSP community on November 12th 2021. The event happened online, on Hopin easy-to-use web platform for conferences.
There were various known speakers from the Angular community and also the official Angular Core Team joined (Emma Twersky, Mark Thompson, Jessica Janiuk) in the last part.
The atmosphere of the conference was easy going and was moderated by Giulia Tosato, Tomas Trajan and also Tracy Lee joined in the last part.

                    <span>Motion One is a new animation library built on the Web Animations API. If you have used Popmotion or Greensock before, this library&#x27;s syntax should look very familiar.
In this blog post, I will show you how to use Motion One in an Angular application. I will walk you through the installation process, create a simple animation, and use Motion One&#x27;s spring and timeline features.
Check out a live demo I&#x27;ve created that you can interact with as part of my Angular Animation Explorer.
First, we will need to add Motion One&#x27;s dependency via npm using the following command.
npm install --save motion

If you run into any typings issue from the library, try adding skipLibCheck: true to your tsconfig.json.

To animate an element from your template, you will need to give it an id so you can access them…</span>

No intro needed, let&#x27;s directly dive into some code snippets for each part of the Angular application!
Actions
Reducers
Selectors
Effects


Effects that use Actions and Services
Effect tests rewritten with observer-spy
Effect tests and fake timers
Effects that don&#x27;t dispatch actions
Effects that use the NgRx Global Store
Effects that use the Angular Router
Components With Global Store
Component Store


Integration tests
Unit tests
Component store unit tests
Component unit tests that use the component store
Conclusion
Let&#x27;s start with the easiest one, which are the NgRx actions.
A reducer is a (synchronous) pure function that is invoked with the current state and an action.

                    <span>Schematics are very useful. They provide us to achieve more in a shorter amount of time. But most significantly used, we can think less about routine stuff which leaves our limited attention span to focus on solving real changes.
Ensure that you have the following packages installed at a global level on your computer. Note that in a real-life development context, you should have some of these local to your project. But for the having well been stable development environment we will install them globally.
node v12.8.0 npm v.6.10.2 @angular-cli (core y cli) v.10 @schematics/angular @schematics/schematics@0.1000.5
This allows us to use the schematics command and specifically the blank schematics to generate a new schematics project where we can start implementing our custom schematics.

                    <span>This blog is a helpful resource for deciding which solution is best for you: Angular vs React vs Vue JavaScript framework.
If you’re a developer just starting out on a project and can’t decide which JavaScript framework to use, this guide should help.
React is a user interface library, Angular is a front-end framework, and Vue.js is a progressive framework.
They can be used almost interchangeably to build front-end applications, but they are not identical, so it is important to compare them and understand their differences.
Each framework is component-based, allowing for the rapid development of UI features.
In this segment, we’ll look at various aspects of Angular, Vue, and React to see how they can meet your needs. This post is not just a comparison of Angular vs. React vs. Vue, but it a…</span>

  Full instructions are here


To install Certbot, you should have Snap installed as well. For instructions, follow this tutorial.

Then, update snap
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
To use Certbot you should have server_name in your Ngnix config. For example, this is a sample of how my Nginx config file looked like before Certbot.
server{
        root /home/pi/website;
        server_name example.slashtechno.com;
}

Once you have the config set up properly, restart nginx. On most systems it will be the following command.
sudo service nginx restart  
sudo certbot certonly --nginx  
sudo certbot delete</span>

                    <span>Creating a Postcard with Lob and Node.js


Lob’s Print &amp; Mail and Address Verification APIs enable developers to interact with Lob’s services programmatically. You can mail a postcard or letter to your customers at critical points in their journey as easily as you might send an email. These physical reminders help you keep in touch with clients, and encourage clients to keep purchasing your products and services.   
In this three-part tutorial, we’ll create a postcard template, verify our recipient’s address, send a postcard, and track it along its journey. We’ll create a Javascript application to do all this, so our users can access everything they need in one place.

                    <span>Here at Deepgram, we work with audio files all the time. We have SDKs that make it easy for developers to send audio files to our API. But it&#x27;s also really useful to know how to post an audio file to a backend server in case you ever find yourself needing to do that. So I thought I would introduce a simple way for Node developers to take an audio file that is uploaded through the browser and send it to a backend Express.js server.
Let&#x27;s start on the backend with our Express.js server. Express.js is a Node.js framework that provides us with so many useful methods and middleware, making working in Node that much easier.
We&#x27;ll set up the server and implement a middleware package called Multer that helps us handle different file types that we receive to our post endpoint.

At its core, Tron is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain built around native cryptocurrency Tronics (TRX). It works not unlike BitShares (BTS) or Eos (EOS): tokenholders lock their tokens in favour of validators in order to share transactional fees with them.

                    <span>Typescript 4.5 was just released and one of the features that stood out to me is the Template String Types as Discriminants. In this article, we are going to explore this new feature using rudimentary examples.  In my last article, we covered using discriminated unions to write better types that are easy to narrow. 
This is an extension of that but instead of having a concrete literal type, you can use a non-concrete literal type i.e. string, number, etc. instead as part of the template literal type, and Typescript will be able to use it as a discriminant.
In order to understand this feature, we are going to start by creating two types: SuccessType and ErrorType. They are going to represent possible responses for different operations we can perform in a computer system i.e. HTTP Request, F…</span>

                    <span>Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) is one of the most common forms of broken access control which OWASP recently listed as the number one application security issue in 2021. A quick search for &quot;IDOR&quot; on Hacker One&#x27;s Hacktivity feed shows that many top tech companies (and even the U.S. Department of Defense) have fallen victim to IDOR, in some cases paying out well over $10,000 per bug bounty. In this post, I&#x27;ll explain what IDOR is, what causes it, and ways to protect your application against it.
IDOR is an access control vulnerability that occurs when an application uses an identifier for direct access to an object in a database but doesn&#x27;t perform proper access control or authorization checks before querying or modifying the database.

It is a service introduced by AWS (Amazon Web Services) which allows users to add authentication to projects, it allows users to sign in with different social identity providers, and scales to millions of users and requests.
It supports access management standards like OAuth and SAML, users do not have to worry about setting up a UI for authentication as it provides a built-in UI that can be integrated with any application very quickly, this UI can also be customized according to specific requirements of the company.

If your computer still uses a conventional HDD, it is high time to consider switching to a solid-state drive – SSD. It is going to add a significant boost to your computer or laptop.
Are SSDs so perfect? Well, not exactly. In comparison with HDDs, solid-state drives have certain advantages, the most prominent being the limited number of read/write cycles. It means that the number of erase/write cycles for SSDs is lower than for conventional hard disks. In today’s article, we will try to explain the cause for such deficiency and how you could avoid wearing out the disk more than needed.

So Let&#x27;s Begin!
Generate a random password, according to the user input.
Get user input
Create lists for letters etc...
Loop over lists and make a password.
Print the password.
Get user input
Here we will use try/except blocks so that when user types a string we do not get an error.
We will get inputs for number of special characters, small letters, big letters and numbers required for generating the password.
Code:

A lot of grey area exists between SAM and the CDK. SAM makes it nice to verify things locally before pushing out to AWS, CDK doesn&#x27;t provide anything other than seeing your initial stack. So the dev process for the cdk looks like, read docs -&gt; write js -&gt; deploy to CloudFormation (typically a few minutes for anything more than a s3 bucket) -&gt; manually verify  -&gt; repeat. Not a fast process at all. Honestly if you could just take the support for local debugging from SAM and give it to the CDK it&#x27;d be near perfect.
CDK documentation is pretty confusing. Somewhat understandable given how young it is, but still. Also doesn&#x27;t help that a lot of the guides that exist are also outdated. Some even coming from AWS themselves. There&#x27;s also a lot modules in th…</span>

                    <span>Using React Material UI you have the opportunity to use any SVG file like an icon. To do so, you just wrap it into the SvgIcon component.
An example for your HomeIcon component might look like this:
import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { SvgIcon, SvgIconProps } from &#x27;@mui/material&#x27;;
import { ReactComponent as HomeSvg } from &#x27;../../assets/Icons/Home.svg&#x27;;

function HomeIcon(props: SvgIconProps) {
  return (
    
  );
}

export default HomeIcon;

Importing svg files as react components required svgr, otherwise you would need to use the SVG code as children of SvgIcon
With SvgIcon you have the possibility to set the fontSize attribute to &quot;small&quot;, &quot;inherit&quot;, &quot;large&quot; or &quot;medium&quot;, but what if we if we would need more of this?





Here is where component variants come into play.
In our theme we just add a new variant to the MuiSvgIcon component. E.g. we we want an new size called huge we do it like this:
components: {
   MuiSvgIcon: {
      variants: [
        {
          props: { fontSize: &#x27;huge&#x27; },
          style: {
            fontSize: &#x27;5rem&#x27;,
          },
        },
      ],
    },
}

That should already work, but when we are using typescript and setting it, the compiler will complain.


So we need to extend the interface for the component too:
declare module &#x27;@mui/material/SvgIcon&#x27; {
  interface SvgIconPropsSizeOverrides {
    huge: true;
  }
}

Just add the above module declaration e.g. to your theme.ts  and that&#x27;s it.</span>

                    <span>What’s Onion architecture?


As shown in the picture, onion architecture is a way to structure the code by dividing it into domain-driven design layers. each layer can only access the layer below it throw its interfaces, and then using the dependency inversion principle each interface will be replaced with its class.

Onion Architecture leads to more maintainable applications since it emphasizes separation of concerns throughout the system.” Jeffery Palermo
NestJs is a service-side framework based on NodeJs. NestJs has many built-in features but most importantly for us now is the Dependency Injection and the possibility to add Dependency inversion which is what we need to apply the Onion Architecture.

                    <span>Typescript 4.5 was just released and one of the features that stood out to me is the Template String Types as Discriminants. In this article, we are going to explore this new feature using rudimentary examples.  In my last article, we covered using discriminated unions to write better types that are easy to narrow. 
This is an extension of that but instead of having a concrete literal type, you can use a non-concrete literal type i.e. string, number, etc. instead as part of the template literal type, and Typescript will be able to use it as a discriminant.
In order to understand this feature, we are going to start by creating two types: SuccessType and ErrorType. They are going to represent possible responses for different operations we can perform in a computer system i.e. HTTP Request, F…</span>

XML: Back in the late 90s to mid 2000s this was king both as a messaging protocol and flat file format. It gets a bad rap, but there is a lot to like about XML as a config file format, including great tooling support and a robust schema definition language in XSD.
