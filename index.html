                    <span>In the last article, we asked ourselves how the operating system gives each process the illusion that it has its own address space despite only having one hardware RAM. This is one of the most important and most complicated virtualization techniques that the operating system performs. Because of that we will discuss memory virtualization in three separate articles. The goals of the operating system with respect to memory are as follows:
Give processes a contiguous address space
Give processes memory isolation from each other
Do both of the above efficiently with respect to memory usage and processing speed
Let‚Äôs first talk about what memory is. Memory can be thought of as a series of slots. 32-bit memory has 32-bit slots and 64-bit memory has 64-bit slots. The size of a computer‚Äôs memory c‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>O que √© o Event Emitter?


Event Emitter √© um m√≥dulo do NodeJS que nos ajuda a criar um padr√£o de publisher-subscriber.
Com um Event Emitter podemos simplesmente criar um evento de qualquer parte de uma aplica√ß√£o, escutar este evento e tomar alguma a√ß√£o baseado nele.

Para criar um event emitter √© preciso instanciar o EventEmitter do m√≥dulo events no NodeJS.
const { EventEmitter } &#x3D; require(&#x27;events&#x27;);

const eventEmitter &#x3D; new EventEmitter();

Esse √© o b√°sico para criar um event emitter. Mas o que podemos fazer com ele? ü§î
A classe do EventEmitter t√™m uma s√©rie de m√©todos e podemos us√°-los para publicar e ouvir eventos. Por hora, focaremos em dois deles:
emit(eventName...)
on(eventName...)
Para publicar um evento n√≥s utilizamos o m√©todo emit(). J√° para ouvir, utilizamos o m√©todo on(). E a ‚Ä¶</span>

Before creating Ditsmod, of course, I was looking for: &quot;Are there ready-made solutions for my purposes?&quot;.
I believe that the set of the following features is unique at the moment:
The framework is written in TypeScript (and under the hood there is no ExpressJS or Fastify ;).
Modular architecture with decorators.
Has a hierarchical Dependency Injection that allows you to use classes as a search token, rather than their names.
Clearly delineated providers arrays for DI injectors at the application, module, route, or request level.
Built-in support for nested routes, such as /api/posts/:postId/comments/:commentId.
Check for collisions when importing providers. This feature allows you to detect situations where you import two or more modules that export providers‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>As an Angular developer, one of my biggest challenges was shifting my thought process from mutable-, to immutable state.
In an Angular service, you can simply assign a new value to a property, and like magic - the change detection would kick in and update any component using the property. 
Switching over to React, suddenly immutable state is the way to go! Then, suddenly Redux - actions, reducers, middleware, dispatchers, and the list goes on. 
The first time I saw Redux toolkit, the very first thing that hit me, in Reducers:
...
reducers: {
    increment: state &#x3D;&gt; {
        state.value +&#x3D; 1;
    }
}
...

Assignment operator in a Reducer? For a brief moment I thought I somehow ended up in the Vuex documentation, this is how you update state in mutations. But No, it was Redux Toolkit.

}
What is Component?
Angular Application. It allows us to mark a logic class, and additional metadata for processing at runtime. Components have a template (in above code is &#x27;./app.component.html&#x27;) and only one component can be instantiated per an element in a template. 
NgModule. So you should declare it in a NgModule:

II. Angular Service
What is Angular Service?

Angular Service is an JavaScript function that&#x27;s responsible for doing a specific task. Using Services to exchange and processing data then keeps Components focused on doing business logic on the view.  So it&#x27;s very helpful to organize a big project that makes codes more clear and clean for development and reusability.

So when I moved into a new role working on cloud deployments, I took it as an opportunity to learn cloud development and deployments. It didn&#x27;t take me long to run into a bunch of headaches that comes with working on these platforms.
While searching for solutions and documentation on the various problems I&#x27;ve come across, I would often see references to OpenStack and it got my curiosity going. What is OpenStack? What services does it offer and who owns it? How do I learn to use it? What are it&#x27;s costs and limitations?

I had to also update the Team Explorer Everywhere (TEE/TEE-cli) that was embedded in that to the latest version. And upgrade java to version 11.   But once that was done, it works well.  Its a tad on the large size for an image.  (1gb), but it seems ok on its memory and CPU usage.  See the kubebox graph at the bottom.

Feature flags or toggles are often* used in application code to allow for rapid integration of new changes without necessarily enabling them in production.
*I have no real idea how commonly used they really are
Feature flags can prevent the dreaded long running feature branch that keeps accumulating changes that you hold off from merging because you&#x27;re not ready for it to go into production in the next release.
These same challenges can apply to your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) where having changes to shared resources you want to test in a lower environment but aren&#x27;t ready to promote to production can be a real problem.
Consider this scenario:
You&#x27;re making changes to your network in a cloud environment.

                    <span>Understanding Kubernetes can be difficult or time-consuming. In order to spread knowledges about Cloud technologies I started to create sketchnotes about Kubernetes, then I&#x27;ve auto-published a book and since now I&#x27;ve started a new serie of video! :-)
I imagined a serie of short videos with a mix of sketchnotes and speech.
I think it could be a good way, more visual, with audio &amp; video to explain Kubernetes (and others technologies).
This episode is focused on HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler).




The video is in French BUT I done the subtitles in english (and french too).
If you liked the video and are interested to watch another ones, please give me some feedbacks (and you can also subscribe to my Youtube channel, if you want to ‚ù§Ô∏è).
Here the illustrations that you can see in the video:

If you are interested, I published all the sketchnotes on Kubernetes (and new ones!) to make a &quot;book&quot; of 165 pages: &quot;Understanding Kubernetes in a visual way&quot;.
If you like theses sketchnotes, you can follow me, I will publish others sketchs shortly :-).</span>

It is easy to use tool for making local development SSL/TLS certificates. 
At first, you need to install it. You can download a binary file from here to use it immediately without installation. Or follow the installation guide for your OS.
Run command to create local CA (Certificate Authority).
mkcert -install

Run command to create certificate files.
mkcert localhost

That&#x27;s it. 
You have two SSL certificate files now: *.pem which is a certificate file and *key.pem which is a key file. 
Use these files in the configuration of your local webserver.

                    <span>Introduction


Docker is a free and open framework for building, delivering, and running apps. Docker allows you to decouple your code from your hardware, allowing you to easily deliver apps. You will handle the infrastructure the same way you manage your apps with Docker. One of the characteristics you have with docker is that you can run multiple docker environments in the same host environment. 
This is where Docker swarm comes into the picture. A docker swarm is the virtualization of the large number of nodes(running Docker engine) running in a cluster. These nodes can communicate with each other, helping developers to maintain multiple nodes in a single environment.
A swarm mode consists of Multiple Docker hosts which serve as managers (to handle membership and delegation) and workers‚Ä¶</span>

Arch Linux comes with a powerful package manager called pacman. Often new users take time to figure out its commands because it does not have the usual &#x27;obvious&#x27; commands like apt. So here is a short post about pacman commands.
Note : All pacman commands need to be run with superuser privileges. You need to prepend the commands with sudo for them to work. For the sake of brevity, I have omitted sudo.
-S flag asks pacman to synchronize packages.
pacman -S package1 package2 package3

will download install specified packages along with their necessary dependencies.
By default, package is searched in repos in the order they are listed in /etc/pacman.conf.
In case a package is available from more than one source, then you can specify the repo name before package name to select th‚Ä¶</span>

It is easy to use tool for making local development SSL/TLS certificates. 
At first, you need to install it. You can download a binary file from here to use it immediately without installation. Or follow the installation guide for your OS.
Run command to create local CA (Certificate Authority).
mkcert -install

Run command to create certificate files.
mkcert localhost

That&#x27;s it. 
You have two SSL certificate files now: *.pem which is a certificate file and *key.pem which is a key file. 
Use these files in the configuration of your local webserver.
If you want to know how to generate it manually, read the How to get HTTPS working on localhost article on my website. The article has a simple Nginx example of configuration to use generated SSL certificate.</span>

                    <span>Vim is the best text editor out there. I have been using it for almost a decade now and I‚Äôm not going back to Sublime Text or Atom or even Notepad. The fact that you can do all of your development work in the same tool that is also used to write your code is amazing.
Vim is a powerful text editor with a lot of history and a certain aura of mystique around it. In this article, I&#x27;ll try to dispel some of the myths around Vim and explain why you should learn to use it on the command line.
Anyone who spends significant time in front of a terminal should consider learning to use vim.
First, why not learn to use Emacs or [insert favorite text editor here]? The two main reasons I like Vim are that it&#x27;s ubiquitous and easy to use. Most server installations have Vim available. There&#x27;s even a version included with Mac OS X.
You can use it while coding, writing articles, notes, or even making spreadsheets. It can literally be everywhere you are! You can edit files through ssh! 
Unlike the latest frontend framework or latest shiny language, vim always stays the same through the years. So it&#x27;s good to learn vim.
Vim has been the main editor used by most Linux users for at least 15 years, so you&#x27;ll almost certainly find it on any server where you need to log in via SSH.
Learn Vim by interactive exercises, no need to struggle with man pages or blogs.
You can use the keys to navigate your code and vim. Press gg to move to the top of the file, press G to move to the end of the file, press / to search etc.
Once you know the shortcuts, it&#x27;s a lot easier than grabbing your mouse and going to the menu bar, click edit, click find etc. It saves you a lot of time when coding.
Any reasonably recent version of Vim has strong support for all kinds of programming languages, so it&#x27;s great for editing source code.
Vim supports all kinds of plugins and can be used even over an ssh connection to a sever. 
On top of that, you can use plugins like YouCompleteMe for code completion and NerdTree for a file browser.</span>

Linux has a long history and a lot of great features, such as multiple command line options for each executable, shell aliases, built-in help, and powerful pipes. Unfortunately, all of these features become useless if you don&#x27;t know how to use them properly. 
Here are 5 tips that could make you more productive at the shell prompt.
When entering commands in Linux, you may skip some of the parameters that are included in them. For example, if you want to view all files inside a directory, you may enter ls by itself instead of ls -a. Both of these commands will list all‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Taking inspiration from Neovim, xplr v0.10 has embraced embedded luajit to enable better hackability.
With only bash and YAML, we are limited to what interpreters, vms or shells are installed in the users system.
For e.g. we can&#x27;t write a hack that executes a Python script and claim that it will work the same on any machine. Some system doesn&#x27;t even come with bash installed. Or even if installed, we still need to worry about the version.
Lua on the other hand, can be shipped with xplr natively, because it&#x27;s really tiny. That means, we can write a lua script and claim that it should work fine on any system. Even if there&#x27;s no lua installed.
This lets us distribute our customizations for other users to use via a plugin system.

Before creating Ditsmod, of course, I was looking for: &quot;Are there ready-made solutions for my purposes?&quot;.
I believe that the set of the following features is unique at the moment:
The framework is written in TypeScript (and under the hood there is no ExpressJS or Fastify ;).
Modular architecture with decorators.
Has a hierarchical Dependency Injection that allows you to use classes as a search token, rather than their names.
Clearly delineated providers arrays for DI injectors at the application, module, route, or request level.
Built-in support for nested routes, such as /api/posts/:postId/comments/:commentId.
Check for collisions when importing providers. This feature allows you to detect situations where you import two or more modules that export providers‚Ä¶</span>

This post assumes you are following along with the baseline project tutorial, but the concepts apply to any Typescript project.
Currently, we are storing the configuration for our application externally, in environmental variables. This is beneficial, because it allows us to change our app configuration without changing any of the code in our codebase.
However, we want to ensure that all of the environmental variables needed for our app to run are set when our app starts. Otherwise, our app might start initially, then crash due to an error when a variable is unexpectedly undefined.
It would also be nice to export a single config object that we can use throughout our application, instead of having to reference process.env.VARIABLE_NAME‚Ä¶</span>

We were working on this project where we had to upload n products to an ecommerce application. Sure it isn&#x27;t such a big deal. The catch was we had to scrape the data from another place and upload to another place. And for some reason the upload APIs were damnnnnnn slow. 
Our UI was the simplest. It had a white screen with a button that said &quot;Scrape &amp; Up&quot;. Little did the client know so many things happened behind it. Yes am an obsessed backend dev. Anyways the problem was the user experience. We couldn&#x27;t just show a loader to the user while the products were uploaded. At any moment we might have from 10 to 10,000 products. If we decided to show a loader for 10k product upload, there was high chance the user might get hypnotized by looking at the loader. 
So here is what we dec‚Ä¶</span>

Moving forward with the subject we discussed in the previous post, let&#x27;s focus on to the part that is most important to us, the tests.
The resources of a microservice based applications can be manipulated in several ways. It is possible to create, update, delete them, and do other operations as well.
When we send a request for a service, we need to inform the URI to identify which resources we intend to handle. We also need to inform the type of manipulation we want to do on the resource. For this, we will use the HTTP protocol methods.
The HTTP protocol has several methods, each one has a different function. The most used are:
GET: retrieve data for a resource.
POST: create a new resource.
PUT: make a change to a specific resource that already exists.

If you are a JavaScript developer, I am pretty much sure that you have used the npm package UUID at least once in your development journey.
For those who don&#x27;t know what is UUID. It is an npm package to generate a unique string ID. Similar packages are available in other languages too.
But in this article I am not going to discuss UUID, rather I will discuss another awesome npm package to generate a unique ID known as NanoID.
A tiny, secure, URL-friendly, unique string ID generator for JavaScript.
It is smaller in size as it has no dependencies.
It is 60% faster than UUID.
It uses cryptographically strong random APIs.
It uses a larger alphabet than UUID (A-Za-z0-9_-).
We can control the behaviour of alphabets to be used.

                    <span>Hello there guys!
As the days going through and summer is nearest a lot of you
Today, i will focus in one depedency called Helmet.js is open repo
helmet-repo which helping us provide some
You can use npm or yarn i will head with npm so simple we can install it npm install helmet --save and save it globally.
So if you already have an express server running,you can just
const express &#x3D; require(&quot;express&quot;);
const helmet &#x3D; require(&quot;helmet&quot;);

const app &#x3D; express();

app.use(helmet());

// ...

Helmet is a function used as  middleware and is wrapping 11 smaller middleware&#x27;s,sets HTTP Headers,origin validations and some other stuff to avoid multiple attacks on your website-webapp.
So the above app.use(helmet());  is equivalent to this
app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy());

                    <span>What is Data Validation?


Data validation is the process of checking whether a given value fits certain criteria based on its business requirements.
For any input - a UI input field or an API input body, data validation is crucial. Any arbitrary input should never be trusted. And data validation plays a vital role in making sure these inputs are rigorously funnelled through the right pipes before they create unintended side-effects in our applications.
In JavaScript projects, both the browser and node.js, that is, there are several npm packages available to do data validation. I&#x27;ve personally used joi and yupjs.
joi was my goto choice for Data Validation for a long time. It worked really well with hapijs and has a great community around it. Trust me, I don&#x27;t have anything against joi, it&#x27;‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Hi guys today we gonna implement password reset via email in node.js. If you user forgot there password, we send an link to you user email account. From that link user can add there new password. If you just wanna know how this concept works, you can start from Model section .
So let&#x27;s start coding...

  The baseline project


This post assumes you are following along with the baseline project tutorial, but the concepts apply to any Typescript project.
Currently, we are storing the configuration for our application externally, in environmental variables. This is beneficial, because it allows us to change our app configuration without changing any of the code in our codebase.
However, we want to ensure that all of the environmental variables needed for our app to run are set when our app starts. Otherwise, our app might start initially, then crash due to an error when a variable is unexpectedly undefined.
It would also be nice to export a single config object that we can use throughout our application, instead of having to reference process.env.VARIABLE_NAME‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.

In the next few passages, I will try to explain why in many Angular projects it is important to have good modal and notification features as well as why I wrote the npm library on that subject.
In the professional world, I have several years as an Angular developer behind me and a few more of developing in other technologies.
Angular is for sure one of the worthy things that improved web development in the last ten years. The way it handles the view of the HTML and how it binds it with typescript is great. 
The small minus is, like in almost any other framework which imposes their own structures, that the developers can be brought into the situation to just follow the basic imposed way of creating things. Often a framew‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>So I&#x27;m back with another small post to show how you can leverage directives to do magical things in your Angular application. Directives are really powerful. Once you get to know about the, you can start leveraging it to move your imperative logic into directives.

We are going to use a pattern that is used by  Angular Material. My intention with this post is to show you how these libraries do it. We just use what the library gives us, and most of the time we use it without actually knowing how it works.
By the end of the post, you would definitely think Was it always this easy to make cool stuff? 
This is a very valid question that you can have. Why can&#x27;t we just have a simple div and then style it accordingly in our component? Well, you can do that.

Now, from the above diagram, it is quite conspicuous that this system is based on some AWS components and it&#x27;s a messaging system. Firstly, it maybe seems overkill to think about the IaC solution deeply. However, In the long run, it can save a ton of deployment time. Thus, I decided to leverage the IasC solutions, which codifies the entire architecture. There are several tools for managing serverless applications, such as AWS SAM, serverless framework, and terraform.

                    <span>First of all in simple terms, Frontend of a website is a simple structure and arrangements of things in such a way as to make a sense to the user (whoever it might be).
Creating frontend is not as easy as it is learning html/css/js. The real hard work starts when you start using frameworks and libraries to make your frontend look more exciting.
But, once you reach above it all you start to detail with some of the complex process and errors of web development thrown by some of the coolest frameworks and libraries you just used. 
To be frank, debugging these errors is not always hard but sometimes it can be a situation when you don&#x27;t want to loose the war. The complete outcome depends upon your solution, and uh yes, clock is ticking too. You wanna meet the deadline too.
It&#x27;s not the end. 
You still have animations and other libraries to use in your project too. So, you don&#x27;t waste any more time and start using them. Now, you are in the biggest hole you created yourself.
Keep debugging my dear friend.
See you next time.

                    <span>If you have downloaded some custom binary (external program) and want to access it from terminal irrespective of your current working directory, probably you are looking for PATH variable in Linux.
PATH is an environment variable which contains a list of directories separated by :.
echo $PATH it shows me
/home/my_user/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin

Oh, wait! But what are these folders, and what is their use?
Output for echo $PATH may be different for you based on your Linux distros and program you have installed.
So whenever I typed any command in the terminal, OS will start finding that program one-by-one into these directories, whenever it found first match, it will open it. If it can&#x27;t find the given command it will display an error command not found. 
$PATH.
flutter I can&#x27;t access it. To get this working I have to update the $PATH variable, something like this
export PATH&#x3D;&quot;$PATH:/home/my_user/flutter/bin&quot;
flutter in terminal you can access it from anywhere.
Are these changes are permanent, what if I close the terminal or shut down my machine, will they persist?
NO. 
.bashrc file, If you are using zsh or any other terminal please update its respective profile/settings file.
export PATH&#x3D;&quot;$PATH:/home/my_user/flutter/bin&quot;
.bashrc file and save the file.
What is $PATH variable?
Update terminal settings file, for bash it is .bashrc

It has 8 GB of RAM and an AMD A9 CPU. It‚Äôs very slow while running Ubuntu specially when using several tabs of Firefox or Chrome and while running applications like Skype. So I decided to give Lubuntu a try. I had ready a lot about how fast it is while being very similar to Ubuntu.
Persian Keyboard was easy to install, but finding/defining a shortcut to switch between keyboard layouts was really though. Finally I find a work-around here.
Sleep by closing lid causes crash. [SOLVED] by arbitrary changes and updates
When using LibreOffice Calc/Writer I encountered several screen mess up in a way that nothing can be read. I forced  to window resize several time again. An update on LibreOffice solved the problem magically.
A border has appeared on my desktop. It is a thick black one. It is not related to graphic card. Because some applications like Firefox and VS Code can easily toggle full screen and used all my screen.
I saw some ACPI Error on startup in first days. It was something related to Graphic card. I did not say the error again.
Wifi interface was not recognized in first place, but some hacks solved the problem.
It seems that my webcam is not recognized yet.
Cannot format/partition USB disk. All guides are about Ubuntu Disks. I need this option specially because my USB is bootable and now it needs to be partitioned again. [SOLVED] I realized that I should use KDE partition manager. Also I can install gnome-disk which is Ubuntu standard.
Anyway, as far as I can program Nodes.js, React.js and ASP.NET Core, I am happy with it. Specially now that is fast enough (yet!)</span>

I have read a lot of exciting, helpful and inspiring articles/posts on dev.to and have felt like giving something back for a long time. Additionally a colleague of mine have been pushing me to writing a blog post for a long time (thank you, Jonathan) so I thought this fuck up and how it was solved, might as well be helpful, interesting and inspiring for others.
Please don&#x27;t hesitate to give any kind of feedback for my first post!
As the title indicates, I committed and pushed a secret to git. I had to run some code locally relying on this secret and as I were eager to resolve the problem I was working on, I eventually forgot all about the secret.... So I staged the file files, wrote a commit message, committed them and pushed it all to GitHub, including the secret and boom! ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s generally accepted that we should never simply trust a user&#x27;s input. Otherwise, we&#x27;re vulnerable to malicious input (CE-5). For a file upload from a user, it‚Äôs common to check their file size or type, especially when restricting them by those two attributes. But one that might get overlooked is the filename.
Checking the filename is especially important when it displayed on a web page to prevent HTML or XSS injection. That‚Äôs just on the frontend. On the backend, there are the other usual injections to worry about. Like SQL injection, when storing the name in a database. Or path injection, if storing in a path based on the name.
It might be tempting to dismiss this possibility as something that would never happen. After all, we must make the files first before we can upload them and th‚Ä¶</span>

I created Bash script to generate self-signed certificates. It was maybe when I tried some tests on MariaDB or PostgreSQL connection.

                    <span>A couple of weeks ago, AWS released CloudFront Functions ‚Äî a ‚Äútrue edge‚Äù compute capability for the CloudFront.
It is ‚Äútrue edge‚Äù because Functions work on 200+ edge locations (link to doc) while its predecessor, the Lambda@Edge, runs on a small number of regional edge caches.
One of the use cases for Lambda@Edge was adding security HTTP headers (it‚Äôs even listed on the product page), and now there is one more way to make it using CloudFront Functions. 
Security Headers are one of the web security pillars.
They specify security-related information of communication between a web application (i.e., website) and a client (i.e., browser) and protect the web app from different types of attacks. Also, HIPAA and PCI, and other security standard certifications generally include these headers in th‚Ä¶</span>

In the next few passages, I will try to explain why in many Angular projects it is important to have good modal and notification features as well as why I wrote the npm library on that subject.
In the professional world, I have several years as an Angular developer behind me and a few more of developing in other technologies.
Angular is for sure one of the worthy things that improved web development in the last ten years. The way it handles the view of the HTML and how it binds it with typescript is great. 
The small minus is, like in almost any other framework which imposes their own structures, that the developers can be brought into the situation to just follow the basic imposed way of creating things. Often a framew‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>In my last post we set up Inertia and Adonis. Now that we have a solid foundation to build upon, let us continue fleshing out our CRM app.
In my previous post we used a closure route to test everything worked end-to-end. This is fine for simple one-off routes (things like the &quot;about&quot; page for instance), but for more demanding routes, we&#x27;ll usually reach for a controller.
ace to scaffold a resourceful controller:
node ace make:controller user -r


Take a moment to look at the new controller, Ace created for you. This is a basic template for our future CRUD operations:
import { HttpContextContract } from &#x27;@ioc:Adonis/Core/HttpContext&#x27;

export default class UsersController {
  public async index ({}: HttpContextContract) {
  }

  public async create ({}: HttpContextContract) {
  }

  public async store ({}: HttpContextContract) {
  }

  public async show ({}: HttpContextContract) {
  }

  public async edit ({}: HttpContextContract) {
  }

  public async update ({}: HttpContextContract) {
  }

  public async destroy ({}: HttpContextContract) {
  }
}

Now, let&#x27;s connect some routes to the users controller.
Open start/routes.ts and delete the route we previously created. Instead add this:
Route.resource(&#x27;users&#x27;, &#x27;UsersController&#x27;);

This doesn&#x27;t look like much, but let&#x27;s see what routes were automatically created for us:
node ace list:routes


Pretty neat! Adonis automatically created a route for each controller method.</span>

Prerequisites:
node
yarn
Create the project&#x27;s folder:
mkdir react-app
cd react-app

Generate a default package.json file with yarn:
yarn init -y

Install React, TypeScript and Webpack:
yarn add react react-dom

yarn add --dev @types/react \
        @types/react-dom \
        awesome-typescript-loader \
        css-loader \

        style-loader \
        typescript \
        webpack \
        webpack-cli \
        webpack-dev-server

Add build, dev &amp; clean scripts in the package.json file:

  The baseline project


This post assumes you are following along with the baseline project tutorial, but the concepts apply to any Typescript project.
In the previous post, we implemented listeners to the uncaughtException and unhandledRejection events in node to ensure any unexpected errors crash the application.
express framework, by default, handles any errors that occur within a route and sends an error response to the HTTP client. Even if these errors are unexpected errors that should cause our program to terminate, they will be caught before they can bubble up to our handle function.
In addition, the default error handler responds with an HTML page, which isn&#x27;t ideal. For our API, it would be better if we could send some nicely structured, predictable‚Ä¶</span>

We are going to use a pattern that is used by  Angular Material. My intention with this post is to show you how these libraries do it. We just use what the library gives us, and most of the time we use it without actually knowing how it works.
By the end of the post, you would definitely think Was it always this easy to make cool stuff? 
This is a very valid question that you can have. Why can&#x27;t we just have a simple div and then style it accordingly in our component? Well, you can do that.

Scully.io is a great tool for Angular developers. Its tagline is, ‚ÄúScully makes building, testing and deploying JAMstack apps extremely simple.‚Äù Essentially, you build your application in Angular and then Scully will take it and generate static HTML and CSS for you. Those assets can be deployed, and the end result is a high quality, blazing fast experience. In this post, we‚Äôll talk about how you can extend the default functionality of Scully to better suit your needs. This article will illustrate how to create a plugin, and adding that extra functionality is simpler than you may think.

                    <span>This week AWS amplify announced support for deploying Next.js SSR apps, which has been a long awaited feature. You can read the announcement here.
For the purposes of this guide we will deploy the basic app scaffold provided by create-next-app
Since we will be using Amplify, we first need to go through the installation and setup process. We can figure out how to do that by following the official docs.
Once we have Amplify configured we can go ahead and create a project. We can achieve that by running amplify init

Amplify provides a zero config deploy similar to vercel, which allows us to connect a git provider to use for our deployments. To get started we can go the the Amplify console and select Host web app.

We can now select our preferred git provider such as Github for this example.

After selecting our desired git provider we can select which branch we would like to deploy from.

After selecting a branch we can now configure our build settings, for the most part we won&#x27;t need to modify this config as Amplify will take care of that for us.

Now we can review everything looks correct before triggering a deploy.

Finally we can see the deployment starting and in a few minutes our site will be live!

Thanks to Amplify we can now deploy Next.js SSR app on AWS with a relatively low effort. Let me know what you think about this new feature!</span>

                    <span>Security is an important part of any architecture, especially for remote workers. 
During the pandemic, many challenges have appeared for security teams, I saw a lot... a lot... a lot of cloud admins  creating VPNs for remote workers in order to access to internal apps.
Imagine this: workers for financial teams, managements teams, people that never heard about VPNs... and now they have to create them to be able to work! Poor people from DevOps, trying to explain and create a peering for each worker on the company &#x3D;(
So, what if I tell you that you can secure your apps with no VPN client required? Yep, it&#x27;s possible with GCP Identity-Aware Proxy
The objective for today is create a web app which only authorized accounts can access and it should also be able to consume internal services.

                    <span>üìå The Auth0 Identity Maturity Framework helps you understand what‚Äôs working about your current identity implementation and what needs to mature.



  
  
  
Today‚Äôs users are accustomed to living and working online, and they expect a secure, effortless experience every time they access your platform. Seamless authentication is no longer a nice-to-have; it‚Äôs a requirement for success. And since companies are building more custom applications, users need fast, secure access across multiple platforms and devices. Identity touches every aspect of your business, so managing identity is more complex and more critical than ever before.
In response, organizations are exploring the value of third-party identity-as-a-service (IDaaS) platforms like Auth0. These solutions offer a centralized source of truth for authentication, authorization, and customer insight.
Identity maturity is a way of thinking about the efficacy of your existing identity solution and its capacity to handle new business requirements and customer demands as you grow and scale. Achieving identity maturity involves understanding what a fully functional, centralized authentication solution looks like. Evaluating your current state, creating a plan to improve your identity infrastructure, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement are also key to reaching identity maturity.
As an IDaaS provider, Auth0 works with organizations of all sizes in a diverse array of industries to tackle identity challenges. In doing so, we‚Äôve learned a huge amount about the identity models that work for particular business needs and goals.  
In fact, we‚Äôve consolidated our expertise and our customers‚Äô knowledge and experiences into a solution we call the Auth0 Identity Maturity Framework (IMF): a collection of tools, tactics, and expert input that will help you understand what‚Äôs working about your identity solution and what needs to change.

It‚Äôs very important to understand the fact that everyone wants to feel safe and secure. People worry that they could be replaced by a new fresher hired out of university or cheaper labor abroad.
