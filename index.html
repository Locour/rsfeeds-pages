                    <span>I&#x27;m working with a client to urgently upgrade their Rails app from the Heroku-16 stack to the Heroku-18 stack. Heroku has already end-of-life&#x27;d the Heroku-16 stack at the beginning of this month. And in a few days, on June 1st, they will completely turn off support patches and new builds of Heroku-16 apps.
The Heroku-18 stack is supported until April 2023 (source).
The minimum Ruby version supported by the Heroku-18 is Ruby 2.4.10 (source).
Install the target Ruby version:
$ asdf install ruby 2.4.10

Switch to that Ruby version:
$ asdf local ruby 2.4.10
$ ruby --version
ruby 2.4.10p364 (2020-03-31 revision 67879) [x86_64-darwin19]

Install an older version of bundler (pre 2.x):

For the purpose of this demo, I have already created a simple Angular 7 application that is hosted on Gitlab, the application is a simple, digital clock that looks something like this.


The above diagram describes the whole process, right from a developer pushing the code, to the point where the CI/CD Pipeline builds &amp; deploys the code to Azure Storage (Blob) which is linked to Azure CDN Endpoint.
Developer goes ahead and performs the development locally of the application after which he goes ahead and commits and pushes the code to the version control system in our case it’s Gitlab.


We would then have Gitlab perform the CI/CD in the form of the steps mentioned in git…</span>

DevOps is not an event: it’s a culture. As such, it demands continual improvement in order to stay relevant and competitive. Improvement, however, requires measurement. KPIs are measurements that allow DevOps leaders to see where their teams are, and map out where they are going.
KPIs are metrics that help everyone in an organization from the engineer to the CTO, CIO or CISO. When people at all levels are on the same page, using the same data to build upon, progress happens more easily and quickly. The engineering team uses the information to improve, while the executive team uses it to make decisions that reshape the DevOps in the organization.

                    <span>In Docker for the Build Process, I introduced the idea of extracting the build phase of a project into a dedicated build_img.sh script, which uses the project&#x27;s Dockerised build environment to build the &quot;run&quot; image for the project, allowing a project to be built on a host environment without installing any extra tooling other than Docker. In this post I&#x27;ll expand on this idea and show how we can use this script as a basis for a new, reusable script that allows us to easily work with the build environment of our project.
The idea here is to create a with_build_env.sh script which, at its most basic, will take a command and run it in the build environment, with the local project directory also mounted in this build environment. This means that we could, for example, run bash scripts/with_bui…</span>

                    <span>How to plot bar graph in R.


One of the important aspect in statistics or data analysis is representing data in a graphical method. Today we are going to learn how to plot a common statistical graph called bar chart.
well, you don&#x27;t have any problem concerning that. all you just need to use is the barplot() function. 
barplot function we declare a variable that will hold all the height given then we can insert it inside the function.
Codes&gt;&gt;
height&#x3D; c(1,3, 6, 1,3,3, 4, 3, 3, 1, 3 ,5 ,1, 2, 1 ,4, 3, 2 ,3 ,1 ,1, 1 ,1, 4, 3, 1,5,5)
barplot(height) # this isn’t correct

Result&gt;&gt;

table() function. this table() function helps to count the occurrence of each data.
Codes&gt;&gt;
height&#x3D; c(1,3, 6, 1,3,3, 4, 3, 3, 1, 3 ,5 ,1, 2, 1 ,4, 3, 2 ,3 ,1 ,1, 1 ,1, 4, 3, 1,5,5)
summarizedHeight&#x3D;table(height)
barplot(summarizedHeight) # this correct

Result&gt;&gt;

However, what if we wish to design the graph by giving it title and color. won&#x27;t that be more amazing??
Vectors: is the data will want to use to plot the graph which is important to be summarised by table() function.
col: this is use to color your bar(the rectangular shape).
main: this is the main title of your graph.
xlab: to label on X-axis
ylab: to label on Y-axis.
col.main: this will give main title the preferable colour.
Now let&#x27;s quickly take alook at how to implement this in our codes.
Codes&gt;&gt;
height&#x3D; c(1,3, 6, 1,3,3, 4, 3, 3, 1, 3 ,5 ,1, 2, 1 ,4, 3, 2 ,3 ,1 ,1, 1 ,1, 4, 3, 1,5,5)
summarizedHeight&#x3D;table(height)
barplot(summarizedHeight,col &#x3D; &#x27;pink&#x27;,main &#x3D; &#x27;The height of student in primary1&#x27;,ylab&#x3D;&quot;frequency&quot;,xlab &#x3D; &quot;Height&quot;,col.main&#x3D;&#x27;red&#x27;)

Result&gt;&gt;

title() function

                    <span>This is a hassle-free guide to share AWS Encrypted RDS across two different AWS accounts within 7 easy steps.

Overview




Login to the Source Account, Create a snapshot from RDS.


Creating KMS Key (with details of the destination account)


After the snapshot is created, Create a new copy of the snapshot &amp; attach the KMS key.


Share the newly created snapshot to the destination account.


Log in to the **Destination Account, **head over to **Shared with me **snapshots, and create a new copy of the snapshot.
Restore the copied Snapshot into a new RDS Instance.
Log in to the source AWS Account which contains the source Database and create a snapshot from it.


Cannot share an Encrypted Snapshot straight away.
Click on Share Snapshot, we can see that we cannot directly share the snapshot. For that, we have the KMS key to the rescue.

Open Key Management Service (KMS)
Create a Symmetric key, and add a label along with permission.

Enter the AWS Account ID and save the KMS key.

Once the snapshot is created, Select Snapshot, Click Actions &gt; Copy Snapshot

Provide a name &amp; select the newly create KMS key under the Master key

Once the Copy of the snapshot is created, click on Actions &gt; Share snapshot

Provide the AWS Account key and click Save.

Snapshot which we have shared from the source account will be available in the Shared with me tab under the snapshot window for AWS RDS.
Create a Copy of Snapshot click on Actions &gt; Copy snapshot

Once the Copy of the share snapshot is created we can Restore the snapshot.
Select the Snapshot, Click on Actions &gt; Restore Snapshot


Provide the Details for the new RDS instance and there we go!!.

                    <span>In a pursuit to monitor our Kubernetes Cluster we often need the right set of tools to capture, the right metrics. Although there are a couple of tools present already, today let’s discuss Kube-state-metrics.
Kube-State-Metrics is an open-source light-weight utility used to monitor the Kubernetes Cluster. As the name suggests, it provides information about the state of a couple of Kubernetes objects by listening to Kubernetes API. Kube-State-Metrics acts like a Swiss Army Knife that provides metrics for a long list of Kubernetes-Objects.

git clone [https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics)
kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics/examples/standard/

This will go ahead and install all the components needed such as ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, ClusterRolebinding along with Deployment, and Service.
Let’s test it locally, by exposing the service, run the command
kubectl port-forward svc/kube-state-metrics -n kube-system 8080:8080



As we already, know Kube-state-metrics is Prometheus friendly let&#x27;s get started with scrapping the Kube-State-metrics with Prometheus.

Assuming that you have already installed on Prometheus on your cluster, you can use the above Prometheus Configuration to start scraping metrics.

Metrics Server is another useful lightweight tool that can be added to your Kubernetes Monitoring arsenal. As the name suggests Metrics Server provides metrics for resource utilization like CPU &amp; Memory. Metrics Server discovers all the nodes in the cluster and queries the kubelet which is an agent that runs on each node and further forwards the details for resource utilization i.e CPU/Memory to Kubernetes API Server which exposes it as a Metrics API endpoint.

Terraform is an open-source, cross-platform Infrastructure as a code,(Iaac) software tool that is provided by Hashicorp which is available on Windows, Linux, Mac, and other OS. Terraform provides a better way to provision Infrastructure on various platforms and cloud providers with the help of a configuration file (main.tf). Terraform uses a high-level configuration language called HCL(Hashicorp Configuration Language) which is more human-readable, and easy to understand.

                    <span>Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.
Vim is often used by programmers on Linux. But it can be used on Mac OS X and Windows too.

Vim is a powerful text editor that runs in a terminal, yet can be used to edit any kind of file. It&#x27;s old, it&#x27;s weird, and it&#x27;s hard to learn but also one of the most powerful tools for editing code on any operating system.
So what about commands?
Here&#x27;s a handy cheat sheet to help you get started with the editor. 



Cursor Movement





h
move cursor left


j
move cursor down


k
move cursor up


l
move cursor right


w
jump forwards to the start of a word


b
jump backwards to the start of a word



To write and to use commands press ESC for command mode or i for insert mode.
To save, open and quit a file:



Basic editor commands





:e filename
edit a file in a new buffer


:w
write (save) the file, but don&#x27;t exit


:wq
write (save) and quit


:x
write (save) and quit


:q
quit (fails if there are unsaved changes)


:q!
quit and throw away unsaved changes


:qa
quit all buffers and windows


ZZ
write (save) current file, if modified, and quit


ZQ
quit without checking for changes



You can copy and paste text too:



Cut and Paste





yy
yank (copy) a line


2yy
yank (copy) 2 lines


p
put (paste) the clipboard after cursor


P
put (paste) before cursor


dd
delete (cut) a line


2dd
delete (cut) 2 lines



There are quite a few commands you have to memorize to use Vim effectively, which can be overwhelming when you’re learning. 
You can use these exercises to memorize commands.</span>

To make bash scripts, you should know Linux commands. To practice the command line, you can use this site
A Bash script is a text file containing a series of Bash commands. When the file is executed, the commands are executed in sequence as they appear in the text file.
To get started, you can create a new script called my_script.sh. 
A simple script would be:

                    <span>Vim and emacs are two of the most popular text editors in the world. They are very different, with a different design philosophy.
Vim and Emacs are still used to this day and are both great choices 😁
Vim&#x27;s main advantage is that it is very good at being a text editor and that you can do a lot without having to learn anything new.
You can install plugins, change key mappings, etc. either with the builtin scripting language or by sourcing scripts from your .vimrc .
Emacs is a text editor but more than that. It can be used for email, browsing the internet and a lot more.
Vim is a modal editor. It operates in either the insert mode (where keystrokes are entered and text is composed) or the command mode (where text can be moved and modified).

Your data is safe if you store it on gpg (i.e. encrypted).
So why would you expose your secret information to the threat of being stolen by leaking it to a computer disk?
The only reason is ignorance, because encryption is easy and saves you effort and money in the long run.
Tools like gpg make encryption as easy as saving a file, or even easier.
gpg linux will help you encrypt your e-mails or to encrypt files on your disk so that nobody else can read them without knowing the decryption password which you alone know.

                    <span>How to Write Asynchronous Code in NodeJS


JavaScript is a non-blocking, single-threaded programming language. It will not go from top to bottom, running your functions one line at a time like you would expect.
For example, here is some simple code to read a file:
const fs &#x3D; require(&quot;fs&quot;);

console.log(&quot;starting&quot;);
fs.readFile(&quot;/path/to/helloworld.txt&quot;, &quot;utf8&quot;, (err, data) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (err) console.log(err);
  console.log(data);
});
console.log(&quot;finishing&quot;);

You may expect the result to be
starting

finishing

But instead you get:
starting
finishing


This is because JavaScript does not stop. It will keep going down your code while waiting for a process to finish. There are three ways to handle this and I&#x27;ll go over them from worst to best.

The idea was pretty simple; a meme-driven chat room and a live price chart for each cryptocurrency. I was assigned to create the backend for the project, and my friend would make the web client.
I set three requirements for myself before starting to work on the server. First and foremost, I wanted to get the MVP out as soon as possible. Secondly, I wanted to make the server as lightweight as possible to just leave it running on a cheap VM. Lastly, I wanted to design the architecture to allow for easy scaling if the shit coin investors decide to make another stupid decision and use our application.
The first step was to think of the entire server as …</span>

Dalam praktiknya, proses asynchronous ini digunakan untuk proses-proses yang waktu tunggunya tergantung pada hal di luar proses itu sendiri, seperti koneksi internet, kecepatan penyimpanan, dll. Contoh proses yang dapat dilakukan secara asynchronous:
Query database
Mengambil data dari web lain (HTTP Request)
Menulis/membaca isi file

Setting up DEV environment has irked me for as long as I have been working in this industry. And after some inspiration from a company that is doing many things right, I decided to make this amazing solution easily available to everyone!

                    <span>If hackers want to help you, don&#x27;t reject them.
Here is a short explanation, but be aware these are generic names inspired by old western movies!
Hackers are of all kinds, genders, and ages. Forget about the hoodie, the darkroom, and the need for recognition. Not that the cliché never happens, but remember it&#x27;s a stereotype.
Anyway, not all hackers are cybercriminals. White hats or &quot;ethical hackers&quot; use their skills to test and ultimately improve security for various organizations and people. For example, banks and medical services can be involved.
They use the same techniques as gray and black hats to infiltrate systems. Black hats are known for their dark intentions. I would describe gray hats as &quot;not always ethical hackers.&quot; Sometimes, they do illegal stuff.

                    <span>gpg is a program to encrypt and decrypt files. In other words, it is a program for privacy and security.
Your data is safe if you store it on gpg (i.e. encrypted).
So why would you expose your secret information to the threat of being stolen by leaking it to a computer disk?
The only reason is ignorance, because encryption is easy and saves you effort and money in the long run.
Tools like gpg make encryption as easy as saving a file, or even easier.
gpg linux will help you encrypt your e-mails or to encrypt files on your disk so that nobody else can read them without knowing the decryption password which you alone know.
If you are new to the linux command line, you can practice here

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently taken an interest in self-hosting simple open source applications — to have fun, take control of my privacy, and learn more about Linux, Docker and DevOps!
However, with this comes the need to add some form of authentication in front of all your services. For example, you probably don&#x27;t want just anyone to be able to view all your RSS feeds, or use your markdown editor freely!
The most basic form is HTTP Basic Authentication, which is a pain as it must be configured and re-entered for each subdomain/service. You also need to type it out for each service, which can be challenging on mobile.
Single Sign On (SSO) on the other hand allows you to authenticate with different services with a single login. For example, if you have a Google account, you can go to youtube.com, gmail.co…</span>

                    <span>Recently I developed a personal blog website, bought a domain and wanted to go-live, but had no idea on how to make my website secure. It wasn&#x27;t easy to find the list of steps to achieve this, so I wrote an article so that it will be helpful for others.
If you want to protect communication between the client and the server from eavesdroppers then HTTPS is the way to go because if anyone tries to listen to your communication it will be just random characters to them as HTTPS makes all the calls encrypted. Also browsers nowadays enforce all the sites to be secured and you can notice a padlock icon beside the URL, whereas websites which doesn&#x27;t have a padlock icon beside the URL are flagged as not secured and a warning is displayed before you can continue to browse.

                    <span>This post showcases a quick and easy way to make a Firebase-authenticated user available throughout your React web app.
We are using here plain React with Typescript, and no extra state management library like Redux involved.
Firebase offers us to register a callback that gets called every time a user is authenticated or signed out to get notified about the current authentication situation.
import firebase from &quot;firebase/app&quot;;

firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (user) {
    console.log(&quot;authenticated&quot;, user);
  } else {
    console.log(&quot;signed out&quot;);
  }
});

We thus could implement a React component that is interested in the authenticated user quite straightforward like this:
import * as React from &quot;react&quot;;
import firebase from &quot;firebase/app&quot;;

function CurrentUser() {

From last post, we stopped with a bug that introduce to the system. If we check the console in API we can see there is an error.
error: bind message supplies 2 parameters, but prepared statement &quot;&quot; requires 1


The thing is, in the post resolver, we are providing 2 parameters in the replacement array. But in the query, we only have $1. Because if the user just scroll the home page without login to the system, there will not be an UserId . So we need to change the parameters dynamically according to the query.
So first change the replacement array.
const replacement: any[] &#x3D; [realLimitPlusOne];

Then set the cursor index dynamically.
if (req.session.userId) {
  replacement.push(req.session.userId);
}

                    <span>We&#x27;ve all been there. For some reason we are not really sure what type of object to expect from an API endpoint. Maybe the API has not been defined yet, or whatever. So what do we do?
You&#x27;ve probably seen code like this, because someone knew it was going to be a list of things.
getData(): Observable {
  // return this.http.get(API_URL); // TODO: Integrate with api
  return of([]);
}

But we can do better than that.
You might not know what type of object to expect, but you probably have a vague idea. Maybe it is going to be a list of objects with keys (strings) which you don&#x27;t know yet.
In that case you want to do something like this:

                    <span>With this series I intend to note down some of the confusion and quirky stuff that I encountered out in the wild. So, today I am going to start with this snippet in TypeScript. 
interface CustomState {
  value: {
    [key:string]: any
  }
}

const defaultState : CustomState &#x3D; {
  value: {}
}

const reducer &#x3D; (state: CustomState, action: { type: string }): CustomState &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (action.type &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;reset&#x27;) {
    return {
      value: []
    }
  } else {
    return {
      ...state
    }
  }
}

The CustomState declared at the start includes a property called value, which is an object with key-value pairs of the form string - any. The defaultState variable contains an (empty) object conforming to the interface declared above, which is perfectly normal.

chore-cli is the super assistant for building a typescript library. It can generate development infrastructure for projects or libraries, such as prettier, eslint, husky etc, or even Github Actions Config files. It can save a lot of time every time you create new stuff.
As we know, These tools like eslint, prettier can make the codebase better. But it takes us a lot of time to configure them. If you don&#x27;t want your enthusiasm for writing code to be consumed by these configurations, and if you don&#x27;t like doing these annoying &quot;chores&quot; frequently, try chore-cli.
It&#x27;s easy to use：
npx chore-cli 


Take a look at the README.md for examples and further documentation, and let me know if you find any bugs, or you have any idea for improving it.</span>

                    <span>Linux systems are powerful operating systems with endless possibilities. However, learning to use this amazing OS can be difficult if you’re new to the Linux world. 
You could spend days browsing through forums, copy/pasting code and never really knowing what’s going on or why it works. If you want to learn commands, I recommend this site.
My first tip is pretty basic, but very important. Before you can run any of these commands, you’ll need to start the terminal.
One way is to enter the terminal outside of the GUI. X11 or Wayland provides the graphical user interface on linux. You can switch to the terminal by pressing Alt+Ctrl+F1 to F12.
You can also start a graphical terminal. There are many variants like gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm, kitty and many others.

What is the logical next step? I think you&#x27;ll find the answer to this question within the question itself. 

Next is a framework built on top of React that purports to make the development process even more palatable. Personally, I enjoy working with React already, so I was surprised to find the extent to which Next delivers on its promise. 
What exactly makes learning Next a worthwhile endeavour? There&#x27;s a lot that sets Next apart from simply using React, but let&#x27;s start with 3 key features that Next implements to solve common React problems.

                    <span>Hello everyone👋
Before proceeding, I am assuming, you are aware of the request-response architecture of a basic web application. To build a real-time application like a chat application we can&#x27;t use the basic request-response architecture, but we can use it with a polling mechanism to achieve the real-time behaviour. Apart from the polling mechanism we also have SSE(server-side event) and WebSocket to achieve real-time behaviour.
In this article, I am going to discuss two types of polling techniques i.e, long polling and short polling.
First, we need to know, what is polling?
Polling is a technique in which the client sends a request to the server asking for data in an interval of time.
The response from the server can be empty or any kind of data.
Short Polling is a technique in which th…</span>

                    <span>⏳ Task scheduling allows you to schedule your code to be executed at a scheduled date/ time, at recurring intervals, or once after a specified interval. In Linux, this is often handled by packages like cron. In this article, I will show you top 4 task scheduling packages that emulate cron-like functionality for Node.js apps.
Node Cron


The node-cron module is tiny task scheduler in pure JavaScript for node.js based on GNU crontab. This module allows you to schedule task in node.js using full crontab syntax.

You can install node-cron by using npm.

                    <span>What exactly is Deno?
Deno happens to be a runtime for TypeScript and JavaScript, based upon the Rust programming language and V8 JavaScript engine.
Key comparisons with NodeJS
The core of Deno has been created in Rust programming language in addition to Tokio. Nodejs was created in C++.

Typescript is a JavaScript superset aimed at getting rid of the development issues before the execution of the code.

Typescript is ideal for big applications.

ES6 imports Statements as dependency management.

An absence of npm, indicating that it doesn’t use any package manager such as npm and doesn’t come with package.json for handling modules.

Deno will be breaking on unhandled exceptions that are not the case with NodeJS.

Deno demands explicit permissions for network, file, and environment access.

Will Deno JS be able to replace NodeJS?
Given that Deno can be considered to be an improved alternative to node JS, it might replace node JS in the long run. Nevertheless, it will only be possible over a significant period mainly because a large community depends on node js. At least for the time being, Node js isn’t going anywhere; Deno is only considered a fancy alternate choice.

Referrers on the web allow sites you are visiting to see what site you have come from, as the Referer header (it is actually mispelled in the HTTP Specification) contains a absolute or partial url of the site you&#x27;ve come from if you have followed a link.
commonly used for tracking and analytics, but it can also be used to steal information for example that contained in the URL of a reset password page or where a token is part of the URL, which is why it comes under security headers.

This is the third and final article in a series that guides you through the process of creating a “wishlist” mobile application using the Flutter SDK. The wishlist contains items that the user would like to someday own, storing each item’s name, description, and URL. The mobile app provides the user interface and communicates with a back-end application, which stores the list and provides an API to perform CRUD operations on it. The initial version of the app simply provides a functioning wishlist, while the final version incorporates Auth0 authentication to allow only authorized users to use the app as well as to use a secure API.

Vulnerabilities in billions of Wi-Fi devices let hackers bypass firewalls


It&#x27;s dubbed FragAttacks and it&#x27;s bad news.
Excerpt from the article:
FragAttacks allow data to be injected into Wi-Fi traffic, but they don’t make it possible to exfiltrate anything out. That means FragAttacks can’t be used to read passwords or other sensitive information the way a previous Wi-Fi attack of Vanhoef, called Krack, did.
But it turns out that the vulnerabilities—some that have been part of Wi-Fi since its release in 1997—can be exploited to inflict other kinds of damage, particularly if paired with other types of hacks.

                    <span>Keycloak is a wonderful piece of software, managed with success by RedHat, to be used as an Identity and Access Management software. RedHat distribute it as a zip package to be run on a machine with a JVM installed or as a container. Nowadays, container is a simpler solution, especially if you are using an orchestrator like Kubernetes.
The Keycloak image is available on the DockerHub or Quay. It  provides an important level of configuration through environment variables, which is useful if you are not familiar with WildFly configuration. But, this solution has an important downside, especially for a tool dedicated to security… tags are not maintained at OS level over time and has many vulnerabilities.

                    <span>Javascript objects obj:{} are usually indexed using strings. But certainly, its possible to index them using number and even object types as keys. Because when it comes to index a particular element of a javascript object, JS always stringifies a non-string key by calling toString() method. So number as key will get stringified and object as key must have a toString() method which returns a valid string key.
let obj &#x3D; {
  toString(){
    console.log(&#x27;toString called&#x27;)
    return &#x27;Hello&#x27;
  }
}
let foo: any &#x3D; {};
foo[obj] &#x3D; &#x27;World&#x27;; // toString called
console.log(foo[obj]); // toString called, World
console.log(foo[&#x27;Hello&#x27;]); // World

In typescript, object as key does not work as above in javascript. Typescript usually throws error doing that.

Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve created a VSCode extension that makes complex types easier to read, and I&#x27;ll show you how to use it!
When I&#x27;m writing TypeScript, it sometimes hard-to-read complex types for me, so I often need to bind them to variables and use completion to find properties. I was wondering if there was something I could do to see the expanded types.
I found out about TypeScript&#x27;s CompilerAPI, so I thought it would be a good idea to extract the type and pass it to the VSCode Tree View, so I made it.

                    <span>What exactly is Deno?
Deno happens to be a runtime for TypeScript and JavaScript, based upon the Rust programming language and V8 JavaScript engine.
Key comparisons with NodeJS
The core of Deno has been created in Rust programming language in addition to Tokio. Nodejs was created in C++.

Typescript is a JavaScript superset aimed at getting rid of the development issues before the execution of the code.

Typescript is ideal for big applications.

ES6 imports Statements as dependency management.

An absence of npm, indicating that it doesn’t use any package manager such as npm and doesn’t come with package.json for handling modules.

Deno will be breaking on unhandled exceptions that are not the case with NodeJS.

Deno demands explicit permissions for network, file, and environment access.

Will Deno JS be able to replace NodeJS?
Given that Deno can be considered to be an improved alternative to node JS, it might replace node JS in the long run. Nevertheless, it will only be possible over a significant period mainly because a large community depends on node js. At least for the time being, Node js isn’t going anywhere; Deno is only considered a fancy alternate choice.

                    <span>No, upgrading to Angular 12.x.x will not help.
The Typescript experimental decorators were based on TC39 proposal-decorators.
We use the same Decorators in our Angular codebase to create services, components and other Angular constructs.
But the same TC39 proposal has evolved in a different direction which is semantically not compatible with the experimental Typescript decorators.   
The new spec for Decorators is easier to use and write.
You can find the detailed comparison between old and new decorators here. 
Just finished up the first draft of the new decorators spec, pretty excited about it 😄 https://t.co/ELhZbsiaiR

Does this mean that Typescript experimental decorators will not be compatible with Javascript decorators 😨
— Shivam (@shivamd20

Unfortunately no, the new proposal has differing semantics from previous proposals in a number of ways. TypeScript experimental decorators were also incompatible with the Define semantics class fields, which caused a decent amount of breakage in the ecosystem.

When the proposal advances, figuring out a step-by-step incremental upgrade path for existing decorators users is definitely going to be a priority though! No user left behind 😄

Let&#x27;s just hope that this doesn’t result in fragmentation of JavaScript decorators. We have already faced a lot inconvenience due to commonsjs and ES6 imports.</span>

I wanted to something fun for the holiday season, so I decided to port a variable-width stroke from the Flex Freehand Drawing Library I created back in the early 2010’s. This stroke actually has a venerable history, going back to about 1983, as an exercise I was assigned as a teaching assistant for a graduate course in computational geometry. The instructor’s company recently obtained a very expensive tablet. This system allowed users to scan or load drawings already in electronic form into a display and annotate them with hand-drawn notes using a fixed-width stroke. The instructor had an idea for a variable-width (speed-dependent) stroke that would be the basis for a number of lab exercises. My job was to get his idea working in Fortran (yes, now you ca…</span>

                    <span>⌨️ Improve the User Experience (UX) of an e-commerce application by implementing animations utilizing Angular animations, CSS animations, and Web Animation APIs.



  
  
  
Developers can use animations in meaningful and non-distracting ways to significantly improve their application&#x27;s user experience (UX). This blog post discusses four effective techniques to animate your application&#x27;s user interface, covering popular use cases. You&#x27;ll learn how to transform bland experiences into memorable ones for your users.
I created a demo application to help you focus on adding animations to Angular. You&#x27;ll add animations to a starter app as you progress through this tutorial. The starter application uses Tailwind to take care of its style and layout, but none of the animations discussed here are dependent on it.
Follow this tutorial without cloning any repo, right in the browser using Stackblitz or CodeSandbox.
If you prefer to work locally in your IDE, clone the demo app and check out its starter branch:
git clone -b starter git@github.com:auth0-blog/angular-animations-storefront.git

Once you clone the repo, make angular-animations-storefront your current directory:
cd angular-animations-storefront

Install the project&#x27;s dependencies:
npm i

Run the project locally:
npm run start

Angular comes with a powerful animation module that lets you quickly add motion to your application: BrowserAnimationsModule. Under the hood, this module uses the Web Animations API (WAAPI) to create motion and interactivity. Whenever WAAPI isn&#x27;t available, BrowserAnimationsModule falls back to using CSS keyframes. Angular animations give you the option to use their abstraction layer to animate any properties that the web considers animatable such as positions, sizes, colors, and many more.

Building a web application with Angular and Firebase presented by Mark Thompson. 
| Angular 12.0.1 | firebase 9.11.0 | Node 14.17 |
Taking Mark&#x27;s instruction a bit further; to achieve drag&amp;drop in a bit more realistic situation, calling the store in a service asynchronously. To achieve this status, I stumbled on the .valueChanges(...) method.
The internal firestore documents explains the working of this .valueChanges(...) method as it listen to all documents in the retrieved collection and queries this list as an Observable. 
idField. When the idField option is provided like 
.valueChanges({idField: &#x27;&lt;a-property-of-the-document&#x27;}) it means that the document ID (actually the document&#x27;s name) will be mapped to the provided property being one of the properties within the document-object.
Know the construction of the document, in this case document (ITask) &#x3D; { id?: string; title?:string; description?: string&#x27;; }. 

When calling the .valueChanges(...) method with a provided idField, which is set to one of the provided properties as stated, internally, the ID (actually the document&#x27;s name) of that document is mapped to the &#x27;provided&#x27;-property within the document object.

First step install Angular universal.
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine@next

Next step was set up the build in netlify
npm run build:ssr

The page is ready with server side render, but my client application need to request the articles, The TransferState service help to send information from the server to the client.
  imports: [
    BlogHeaderModule,
    BrowserModule,
    InfrastructureModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    BrowserModule.withServerTransition({ appId: &#x27;dw&#x27; }),
    TransferHttpCacheModule
  ],

Install it as part of the App module and import into  ServerTransferStateModule in server module.
@NgModule({
  imports: [AppModule, ServerModule, ServerTransferStateModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})

Done
Because my app is only text was easy to get more than 95% but keep in mind the following points.
Not all application are the same, my case is a simple blog, so not issues with images, or authentication.
Use https://contrastchecker.com/ and https://alex-page.github.io/sass-a11ycolor for accesibility issues.
If is your first time, try with an easy proyect like a blog or small app.
Take care about how to use or transfer data between components, I got an issue to send data using this.location.getState().

                    <span>A user is usually authenticated by entering a username, email address, and/or password and then being given access to various resources or services. By its very existence, authentication relies on maintaining the user&#x27;s state. This seems to go against HTTP&#x27;s fundamental property of being a stateless protocol.  
Your Angular app will communicate with a backend that generates tokens. The Angular app can then send the token to the backend as an Authorization header to show they&#x27;re authenticated. The JWT should be checked by the backend, and access should be granted based on its validity.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text.
