Inicie criando um novo projeto Meteor se você ainda não um configurado, entre no diretório do projeto e o execute para garantir que está tudo certo.
meteor create my-project
cd my-project
meteor run

Por padrão, Meteor usa React e cria um subdiretório chamado my-project.
meteor npm install tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest postcss-load-config@latest autoprefixer@latest

É recomendado utilizar o comando meteor npm ao invés de somente npm para usar a versão do npm que já vem com o próprio Meteor.
Instale juliancwirko:postcss e remova o minificador padrão do Meteor.
meteor remove standard-minifier-css
meteor add juliancwirko:postcss

Crie um arquivo chamado .postcssrc.js, adicione o tailwindcss e o autoprefixer à sua configuração do PostCSS.

And because a lot of my clients are desperately hiring and need my expertise, I review a lot MORE resumes. I see a lot of things that I consider &quot;red flags&quot; on resumes of engineers with &quot;6+ years of experience&quot; that make me think they really don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing. So here are 5 things that will make me chuck a resume into the reject pile almost immediately.

                    <span>The Lacework VS Code vulnerability scanner extension is a new plugin that will quickly identify vulnerabilities in your base images right from your IDE. This is a first step and alpha release with expanded and additional capabilities to be released soon.
This blog covers how to install lw-scanner and leverage it to perform image assurance scans from within VS Code.
Install lw-scanner
support.lacework.com and the the latest release of the scanner binary can be found at github.com
Once lw-scanner is installed the next step is to download the Lacework plugin from the VS Code Marketplace.

With an active Dockerfile in the editor you can initiate an image assurance scan by clicking Command+Shift+P on macOS (Control+Shift+P on Windows/Linux).

Once the scan is complete you will see a summary next to the base image that will disappear along with a more detailed scan result available in the output window.

Source code can be found here for now: github.
This is just a quick preview update. For suggestions or feedback please open an issue on the repo. PRs welcomed. Stay tuned for more.
Cheers,
Jeff</span>

                    <span>There is a common misconception that no-code (or codeless) platforms and tools are only for non-technical builders. This, of course, couldn’t be further from the truth.
No-code and low-code solutions are typically created by developers as a tool to speed up their own development process. This is particularly true of backend-oriented tools created to automate the redundant and/or trivial tasks that are common with setting up a backend. Once the “simple” tasks are removed, developers can focus on the elements of their project that are true differentiators, be that a gorgeous UI, innovative APIs, powerful logic and algorithms, and so on.

                    <span>The best practice with React is to place API calls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method componentDidMount(). This method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. Any calls to setState()here will trigger a re-rendering of your component. When you call an API in this method, and set your state with the data that the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive the data.


Below is a mock API call in componentDidMount(). It sets state after 2.5 seconds to simulate calling a server to retrieve data. This example requests the current total actives users for a site. In the render method, render the value of activeUsers in the h1 after the text Active Users:.




class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state &#x3D; {
      activeUsers: null
    };
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout(() &#x3D;&gt; {
      this.setState({
        activeUsers: 1273
      });
    }, 2500);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      
Active Users: 
 {
      this.setState({
        activeUsers: 2324
      });
    },1500);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      
Active Users: {this.state.activeUsers} 
      
    );
  }
}</span>

                    <span>You can also pass handler functions or any method that&#x27;s defined on a React component to a child component. This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components. You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. It&#x27;s assigned a name and you have access to that method name under this.props in the child component.
Below there are three components outlined in the code editor. The MyApp component is the parent that will render the GetInput and RenderInput child components.




class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state &#x3D; {
      inputValue: &#x27;&#x27;
    }
    this.handleChange &#x3D; this.handleChange.bind(this);

                    <span>A great thing about FreeCodeCamp aside from it being free it gives you like a great introduction to many different areas. In this case we&#x27;re working on React. Here For example, The MyApp component is stateful and renders a Navbar component as a child. We have to pass the nameproperty in its state down to the child component, then show the name in the h1 tag that&#x27;s part of the Navbar render method. name should appear after the text Hello, my name is:.


Ex:




class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state &#x3D; {
      name: &#x27;CamperBot&#x27;
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
       
Hello, my name is: {this.props.name}
      {/* Change code above this line */}
    
    );
  }
};

About React, there&#x27;s an important pattern to it. The first is unidirectional data flow.
State flows in one direction down the tree of your application&#x27;s components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. 
The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state.

                    <span>Hello all!
Last year we decided to open our internal DevOps workshops to everyone and we had our first DevOps League event, which was a big success (unfortunately it was in Greek, but still a big success!)
This time around we decided to go global (all presentations will be in English), go bigger (4 different companies will participate) and explore the exciting ecosystem of Terraform in a ~5h event. We&#x27;ll start small with the foundations and work ourselves to the top in terms of complexity and best practises.
If you want to join us, feel free to register at https://globalwebindex.zoom.us/webinar/register/1716364742396/WN_SgkXTQZdSlmM5R50295S-A or spread the word if you know anyone who might be interested. Attendance is free, and the whole event is a labor of love from various DevOps in different companies.</span>

                    <span>Our application may have more complex intteractions between state and the rendered UI. Ex, form control elements for text input such as input and textarea, maintain their own state in the DOM as the user types. With React, we can move this mutable state into React Component&#x27;s state. The user&#x27;s input becomes part of the application state, so React controls the value of that input field. Usually will be a controlled input form.
FreeCodeCamp provided us with the code Editor which looks like this right now.




class ControlledInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state &#x3D; {

                    <span>Recording errors is an important part of error handling. In short, when certain errors occur in programs, you want to know about it. This is particularly important with bugs.
You need to:
know that they occurred
have useful information about them so you can debug them later
One way to do this is to use an error monitoring or logging service. Some examples are New Relic and Splunk. These will automatically record any program errors and such.
In particular, logging is very useful. It records a lot of information about what&#x27;s happening in your program. This can help a lot with debugging.
Alternatively, you can manually record information about errors.





  
  
  How to manually record errors


The goal is to be able to view errors later. You can achieve that in any number of ways.

                    <span>Kubernetes&#x27; success is due in no small part to its flexibility and power as a container orchestration system. It can scale virtually indefinitely, providing the backbone for many of the world&#x27;s most popular online services. And as a proven open-source solution with a rich ecosystem, it&#x27;s easily accessible and simple to set up, whether for personal learning, development, or testing.
When it comes to deploying Kubernetes in production, however, things get a bit more complex. There are numerous aspects you need to consider that cover the full spectrum of critical success factors for an online application, including stability, security, and how you manage and monitor your application once it&#x27;s up and running. If you get any of these points wrong, it can be costly.

POST request is one of several available HTTP request types. By design, this method is used to send data to a web server for processing and possible storage.
POST requests usage is one of the main ways to send form data during login or registration. It is also one of the ways to send any data to the web server.

In my AWS adventures, I&#x27;ve come across use cases where it&#x27;d be awesome to have easy access internally to some files in AWS without making something public....or creating an S3 bucket behind a Cloudfront behind a WAF with a whitelist rule.....

Anyway, http-server is an awesome package that does this exact thing for file shares. So I figured I&#x27;d fork the code base and replace all the file server bits with S3 calls.

Opening the hood of http-server, I realized for my specific use case, most of the code has features I didn&#x27;t need. So, I opted to create s3-http-server from scratch with http-server as inspiration. 
What follows is an explanation of the interesting bits.
Firstly, the stack used for this solution:

This blog covers how to install lw-scanner and leverage it to perform image assurance scans from within VS Code.
Install lw-scanner
support.lacework.com and the the latest release of the scanner binary can be found at github.com
Once lw-scanner is installed the next step is to download the Lacework plugin from the VS Code Marketplace.

With an active Dockerfile in the editor you can initiate an image assurance scan by clicking Command+Shift+P on macOS (Control+Shift+P on Windows/Linux).

Once the scan is complete you will see a summary next to the base image that will disappear along with a more detailed scan result available in the output window.

Source code can be found here for now: github.
This is just a quick preview update. For suggestions or feedback please open an issue on the repo. PRs welcomed. Stay tuned for more.
Cheers,

                    <span>Why rate limit?


Rate limiting is a simple way of stopping users (hopefully just the bad ones!) from accessing more of your sites resources than you would like.
I will show you a simple way to rate limit specific URLs by using Nginx.
The written instructions are below, but here is a quick video walkthrough showing how to apply rate limiting in Nginx.





  
  
  How to add rate limiting in nginx


At the top of you nginx file, you can define a map like so:
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr_map zone&#x3D;mylimit:10m rate&#x3D;5r/s;
limit_req_status 429;

map $request_uri $binary_remote_addr_map {
    default &quot;&quot;;
    ~^/what-is-new.html $binary_remote_addr;
    ~^/another-url-to-rate-limit.html $binary_remote_addr;
}

Then within your location block, add:
limit_req zone&#x3D;mylimit;

And that&#x27;s it! Now only webpages matching the $request_uri will have rate limiting applied. This is handy when you have all of your request being routed through a single place, but you only want to have specific pages on your site rate limited.</span>

                    <span>According to a recent research by Cambridge University&#x27;s Nicholas Boucher and Ross Anderson, there are two vulnerabilities that impact most code compilers.
These sorts of vulnerabilities have an impact on software supply chains; for example, if an attacker successfully commits code injection by deceiving human reviewers, future software is likely to inherit the vulnerability.
But let&#x27;s look at the technique:
Extended strings: make sections of string literals seem as code, having the same impact as comments and causing string comparison to fail.


Comment out: forces a comment to appear as code, which is then ignored.


Early returns: bypass a function by running a return statement that seems to be inside a comment.

If you don&#x27;t care about the context of these tests and want to go straight to the node-fetch mocks, skip to the here&#x27;s my solution section.
I wrote a middleware library to be used by micro-services that decodes and verifies JWTs and works with Express and Koa. The requirement was for the library to make an API request to an external service in order to refresh tokens if the provided token had expired. I&#x27;m not writing this post to discuss the library itself, but to talk about how I wrote the unit tests for it as I found it a little tricky to implement a solution that catered for sending and receiving dynamic data to and from the external service, whilst keeping the tests isolated. Hopefully this will be helpful to someone trying to do a similar thing.

                    <span>TypeScript 4.5, which is currently a release candidate, includes an exciting new feature for us types in js JSDoc users:
Defaults for template tags, microsoft/TypeScript#45483: @template [T&#x3D;string]
I found this through when looking for a way to void T defaulting to any when no value was given in this code:
/** @template [T&#x3D;undefined] */
class ErrorWithCause extends Error {
  /**
   * @param {string} message
   * @param {{ cause?: T }} [options]
   */
  constructor (message, { cause } &#x3D; {}) {
    if (cause) {
      /** @type {T} */
      this.cause &#x3D; cause;
    }
    // ...
  }
}

Now it gets set to undefined when no value is provied and my type-coverage got closer to 100%.
And it properly compiles to:
export class ErrorWithCause extends Error {
    constructor(message: string, { cause }?: {
        cause?: T;
    } | undefined);
    cause: T;
}

I will push this new code to my pony-cause module very soon, just wanted to write this up first 🥳

                    <span>Let&#x27;s create a simple React component





import { connect } from &#x27;react-redux&#x27;;
import { RootState } from &#x27;store&#x27;;

import { getCounter } from &#x27;views/counter/state/selectors&#x27;;
import { setCounter } from &#x27;views/counter/state/slice&#x27;;

type Props &#x3D; any; // Next step

export const _Counter &#x3D; ({ counter, setCounter }: Props) &#x3D;&gt; {
   return (
      
Counter: {counter}
 setCounter(++counter)}&gt;+
          setCounter(--counter)}&gt;-
      
 ({
   counter: getCounter(state),
});

const mapDispatchToProps &#x3D; {
   setCounter,
}

export const Counter &#x3D; 
   connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(_Counter);

Note: this will only work if your RootState and actions are typed!
type Props &#x3D; ReturnType &amp;
   typeof mapDispatchToProps;

type Props &#x3D; {
   counter: number;
   setCounter: (count: number) &#x3D;&gt; {
      type: string;
      payload: number;
   };
}

It&#x27;s easy to read, concise, and eliminates the possibility of typing props incorrectly. If your root state and actions are typed then mapStateToProps &amp; mapDispatchToProps will be the source of truth for your component prop types.</span>

                    <span>If you are a JavaScript developer, perhaps you have heard of a new JavaScript runtime called Deno. Like me, you probably thought: “Oh no! Here we go again. Is this going to be another Nodejs vs io.js fiasco or npm vs yarn battle.” You might even have thought: “Yet another tool in the JavaScript ecosystem to make our lives miserable.” After all, JavaScript has a history of making developers feel exhausted. Is Deno going to be another reason for developers to dislike JavaScript?
The short answer is No. In fact, it’s the exact opposite. You should definitely learn Deno in 2022. If you want to know why, continue to read this article. If you are already convinced, great! Head over to the Deno website and start learning it for 2022.

Whenever you need to work or perform operations on function parameter variables with a union type, you need to narrow down or simplify the type from the union type you need to perform the operation on. This is process is called Narrowing in TypeScript.
// A simple function that adds 100 to the number
// we provided as an argument to the function
function add100ToNumber(num: string | number) {
  // Narrowing Types:

  // check if &quot;num&quot; parameter value is of type &quot;number&quot;
  if (typeof num &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;number&quot;) {
    return num + 100;
  } else {
    // then check if &quot;num&quot; parameter value is of type &quot;string&quot;
    // then convert string to number type
    return Number(num) + 100;

Everything about this article was well done and very interesting.
There was one point in the article that spiked my interest: the author triggered the &quot;creation&quot; of the Form Controls dynamically within the Angular HTML.
So, I decided to experiment and see if I could use this as a means to trigger data validation and transformation.
This is an experiment, simple to see if I can do something. Personally, I see some benefit in the pattern. But, this does not mean I am endorsing this as a good pattern or a better means than any other way of doing something.

                    <span>Introduction


In this article, we&#x27;ll look at how to handle the login process with Session Authentication. We&#x27;ll verify if the user is logged in or not, and if he is not, then the route will simply be blocked.
Let’s go through the following Angular principles for better understanding.
Angular Routing module
Manage the user authentication permission for the Angular path.
Angular Auth Guard
This Angular function helps a lot when it comes to handling authentication. This is an interface that instructs the router whether or not to enable navigation to a specific route. We&#x27;re using the &#x27;canActivate&#x27; guard form in this case.
Angular localStorage
In an Angular program, there are three ways to store data on the client-side.
Memory
Session storage
Local Storage.

                    <span>Hey everyone! I am back with another Linux article!😊
Today I will be going over basic commands you can use to monitor system performance! 📈📉💻
The &#x27;top&#x27; command is used to display active processes and how much they are using system resources.

lsof stands for list of open files- basically shows you list of files and the processes

&#x27;tcpdump&#x27; is used to analyze network traffic
&#x27;htop&#x27; is a lot like top - It&#x27;s just allows you to monitor system resources or processes. As you can see, it&#x27;s a bit more fancy than top

&#x27;iostat&#x27; is a command that is used to monitor input/output devices, by telling you how long the devices have been active.

Displays the processes

Tells you how long the system has been up

&#x27;free&#x27; shows you the amount of available memory you have.

Used to monitor individual tasks. Great for troubleshooting issues.

&#x27;w&#x27; tells you information about users logged on and their processes

These commands can be vital for you to monitor your system, so I will be releasing a part 2 soon, as well!😆
For future Linux and security content, please give me a follow

                    <span>Have you ever encountered ERROR: One or more PGP signatures could not be verified! this error during the installation of Dropbox in Arch based distro ? If yes then this guide is for you. 
Dropbox has their own PGP key because they upload it directly to the AUR that key is for linux@dropbox.com (if you don&#x27;t know what PGP keys are it&#x27;s basically a complex math formula that proves that this app is being uploaded and managed on the AUR by somebody at dropbox)
if you use a tool like yay or paru it can handle the functions of pacman and downloading stuff from the AUR and it&#x27;s dead simple to use, I recommend paru because it&#x27;s more modern and faster
To install paru run these commands
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git

cd paru

makepkg -si

After succesfully installing paru now it&#x27;s time to install Dropbox. To do that first run
paru dropbox

Now you&#x27;ll be prompt with a list of packages from AUR to choose from. You have to choose aur/dropbox which should be the first one... So press 1 and hit enter

If you want to review hit Y and enter

To close the review hit q on the the keyboard
Now you must prompt with installation confirmation. Hit Y and enter. You may need to enter your password for installation. 
After completion of you installation run dropbox on your terminal or search on the GUI

That&#x27;s it!</span>

No matter if you are a data analyst or a system administrator when working with unstructured files in Linux there are a set of commands that would help you a lot in your daily tasks.
In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of the following commands and how to combine them using a pipe (|) and analyze some raw data files.
The list of the commands that we will go over are:
cat
head and tail
pipe (|)
wc
grep
awk
sort
uniq
sed
tr
Here is a very simple example file that I will be using to go over each of the commands:

                    <span>Normally, when we are configuring legacy applications is difficult to find accurate documentation about the used tools (Dependencies, Libraries, Environment).
Currently, Symfony&#x27;s version is 5.3.10 thus actual documentation points out towards these newer versions from the framework even though previous documentation is still accessible since version 2.7

Avoid looking for hundred sites and freaking out whether any solutions work or work partially, in this post we are going a step to step to configure a Symfony 2.7 app in Apache 2.4 HTTP Server running in Ubuntu 20.04.
I don&#x27;t recommend editing etc/apache2/apache2.conf because it is the main configuration file of Apache so if you broke that file probably your Apache will not work.

                    <span>I found the linux command line quite intimidating when I first started learning to code. It seemed to require extensive and comprehensive knowledge and understanding of commands and keyboard shortcuts. However, as I read more about it and practiced what I learned, I realized that it isn&#x27;t as scary as it seemed; that It only requires a lot of constant practice. I also discovered that others feel the same way, which made me realise that I wasn&#x27;t alone.
The other thing I discovered during this period is that we are all beginners and sharing is helpful, since no one is an island. So I decided to share my experience with others starting out as well. As we all know, learning is never-ending. There will always be new tools and new commands to learn, especially when you&#x27;re a beginner. The followin…</span>

Working with third parties, contractors and partners who need access to files containing protected data means walking a tightrope between providing useful data without violating privacy, HIPAA or GDPR. 
Let&#x27;s remove protected data from a CSV without writing any code using an example file.

This walk-through will use remove-pii.com. Although we&#x27;re working with a website, no data is transmitted to any server; all processing is handled in the browser. An offline version is also available.
Now, we&#x27;ll provide our CSV to the website. This will parse the headers and allow us to replace any data within the file.  Any unset columns pass through to the final file.

Basic Knowledge of NodeJS
Node JS should be installed on your system.
## What is Passport.js?
Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. It is very flexible and modular. A comprehensive set of strategies supports authentication using a username and password, Google, Facebook, Apple, Twitter, and more. Find out more about Passport here.
Before using passport-github2, you must have a Github account and register an application with Github. If you have not done this, You can do that here.

                    <span>What is great about Node.js is that it allows for building even complex applications that can handle a plethora of real-time data. In the last couple of years, many well-known established companies like Netflix, eBay, or Uber have rewritten their microservices using Node.js. LinkedIn, in turn, has successfully migrated a part of the code that has been written in Ruby on Rails to Node.js. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that robust applications need robust internal tools.
Node.js doesn’t have a default admin panel solution like Django Admin for Django or Active Admin for Ruby on Rails. However, there are quite a few options for building an admin panel for a Node.js application:
Build all internal tools in-house from scratch. This option gives you the maximum flexibility but it also comes wi…</span>

                    <span>tru.ID SubscriberCheck offers both mobile phone number verification and SIM swap detection. SubscriberCheck achieves this by combining the workflows of PhoneCheck, which confirms the ownership of a mobile phone number by verifying the possession of an active SIM card with the same number, with SIMCheck, which provides information on when a SIM card associated with a mobile phone number was last changed. SubscriberCheck can be used when augmenting existing 2FA or anti-fraud workflows.

                    <span>👾 Ransomware attacks are among the most profitable for criminals and remain  the most prominent malware threat today.



  
  
  
As digital assets increase in value (in some cases, being the most valuable assets a company owns), threats become more profitable to criminals too. The largest ransomware payout made by an insurance company ($40 million) to date happened in 2021, and the trend doesn’t show any signs of slowing down.
The major problem with attacks like these is that computers today are so fast and interconnected that malware can harness those resources to spread itself throughout the network and encrypt an enormous amount of files before the victim can respond.
Unfortunately, after the files have been encrypted, there is not much that can be done. Most modern ransomware has goo…</span>

Even worse, about 90% of respondents had at least one security incident last year, leading to the very first wave of Kubernetes-native malware. In this tutorial, we present three tools to validate and secure your Kubernetes deployments.
Kubernetes main selling point is in its declarative nature — we write a manifest describing the desired final state of a deployment and let the platform figure out the rest. But the fact of the matter is that these manifests are easy to get wrong, breaking stuff in the process.
Continuous delivery with Kubernetes is only viable when we test at every stage. For example:
 First, test the code in the build stage.
 Then, build the container image and check its…</span>

                    <span>Being a coder I have never limited myself to one language, one framework and I didn’t want to have a milion code editors each specialised in different thing so I have always used VSCode. Keeping the theme, the look and feel of the editor with power of an IDE one plugin away no matter which language I want to jump into is the key factor that guided my choice.
However, I have tried JetBrains’ WebStorm before and just couldn’t get rid of one huge thing haunting me, the project-wide type checking.
In VSCode the typescript plugin works great but it only checks files that are currently opened in the editor! Other files inside the project are not being checked until opened 😕 Now this is a huge bump, having to run the check manually through console or build the whole app in order to check if one type alternation hasn’t influenced anything else? Madness…
This is when I decided to research this problem — and there really is no out of the box solution! After trying every way on the internet I have finally pieced together the final solution for this problem:
{
    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.0.0&quot;,
    &quot;tasks&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;label&quot;: &quot;tsc-watch project&quot;,
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;typescript&quot;,
        &quot;tsconfig&quot;: &quot;tsconfig.json&quot;,
        &quot;option&quot;: &quot;watch&quot;,
        &quot;problemMatcher&quot;: [&quot;$tsc-watch&quot;],
        &quot;group&quot;: &quot;build&quot;,
        &quot;runOptions&quot;: {
          &quot;runOn&quot;: &quot;folderOpen&quot;
        },
        &quot;presentation&quot;: { &quot;reveal&quot;: &quot;never&quot; }
      }
    ]
  }

This is an automated task for VSCode — it runs when the project folder is opened and keeps on running, checking the whole repo real-time based on the changes you make! Finally! 🎉
Put it in

.vscode/tasks.json




Re-open the project folder and accept the popup asking whether Automatic Folder Tasks should be allowed
If the popup isn’t there do:
⌘⇧p
-&gt; Manage Automatic Tasks in Folder
-&gt; Allow Automatic Tasks in Folder



  
  
  🎉 All done! Enjoy your VSCode with TypeScript better than ever! 🎉</span>

Bom dia amigos, gostaria de citar alguns benefícios de aprender e utilizar TypeScript em JavaScript.
Alguns motivos:
Temos a possibilidades de trabalhar com tipagem, algo muito útil para nós desenvolvedores JavaScript.
Orientação a Objetos, sim, vamos poder usufruir de todo o poder desse paradigma (Class, Interface, Abstract), somando com a programação funcional nativa.
Melhora seu código, seu código vai se tornar mais coeso, bem divido, claro, se você usufruir de interfaces, classes abstratas e da boa e velha herança.
Muitas tecnologias utilizam ou dão suporte ao TypeScript: Angular, React, Graphql, Graphcool e etc.
Lembre-se TypeScript é um supertest de JavaScript, ou seja, você pode implementar ele sem precisar usar esses frameworks citados acima.
Comece agora a utilizar TypeScript e eleve seu JavaScript para o próximo nível. Vou deixar alguns links legais pra você estudar TypeScript:
O próprio site dará todo o suporte que você precisará: https://lnkd.in/dC4bbuX


No próprio site tem uma área pra você começar do zero: https://lnkd.in/dB8pTuj



Agora só depende de você, estude, pratique e use TypeScript em seus novos projetos.
Fiquem com Deus e até a próxima.
Nunca desista de correr atrás dos seus sonhos</span>

aws configure --profile 

You will be asked for two IDs, you can get them through:

 

Create a file called parameters.json:
[
  {
    &quot;ParameterKey&quot;: &quot;KeyName&quot;,
    &quot;ParameterValue&quot;: &quot;&quot;
  }
]

Replace  by your SSH key under EC2 / Key Pairs:

Create a file called .env for the Makefile:
stack-name&#x3D;simple-mean-stack
profile&#x3D;
region&#x3D;

Start it by running make up, an EC2 machine should boot up:

After some time we can reach the app, run make getUrl to get the url:

After refreshing the page few times you should see another IP:

You can remove the entire stack by running make rm! 🔥 
Awesome! Now we have finished our load-balanced Mean-Stack app 😎🎉</span>

So the first thing we need to do is update the existing packages currently present. To do that we need to run the following command in the terminal. This will make sure that you have the latest security patches updated in your instance.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

Now we will install NodeJs. We will install NodeJs using the apt package manager which is the default package manager for Ubuntu. We need to use the following command on the terminal to install the latest LTS version of NodeJs.
sudo apt install nodejs

Verify that node is installed using the below command

To put it simply, they&#x27;ll paste a YouTube link into the game and it&#x27;ll analyze it for them and they&#x27;ll be able to dance to it, being scored in realtime as they dance along. (take a look at the previous blog posts if you need more context!)
I don&#x27;t want to embed YouTube videos in my game. There&#x27;s a few reasons for this:
TensorFlow.js (the machine learning platform that I&#x27;m using) can&#x27;t analyze an embedded YouTube video. The video needs to be inside of an accessible  (or similar) element on the webpage and cannot be embedded.

--- scroll down for screenshots, or Fireblog.io ---
I was originally hosted on Firebase Functions, but I wanted it to be a little bit faster, and the ng deploy to Firebase Functions also stopped working as expected. In fact, I wonder what the Angular Firebase Team is doing at all these days. The documentation for Angular Firebase 9 is still not up-to-date, and it seems like they are behind on updating to Angular 13 (to be fair, it has only been a few days at this point).
Before I get into anything, I have to recommend you check out Fireship.io, as it is the reason I have become proficient in these technologies.

                    <span>In Angular, we use HTTP to get data from backend,HTTP methods always return an observable.Generally we subscribe to that observable and assign response data to class variables to use it in our component.
But using RxJS operators we can compose multiple observables(data streams) or process  observable data  before subscribing to it.
RxJS concatMap operator
Observable emits observable).
concatMap operator
Takes each value from the outer observable and maps that value  to observable(called as inner observable) 
Concat all inner observables into a single observable in order  and subscribe to inner observables and emit data of each inner observable into output observable in sequential manner.
concatMap never subscribes to the next inner observable until the previous one completes.
Example:

Run live
Here we have 2 API’s
In the above case we need to take all roll numbers from the first API  and pass it to the second API.

So solution to this problem is use concatMap RxJS operator instead of nested subscription.

First contactMap operator -
getToppers_rollNum() this method returns an Observable of type number[] , conactMap  maps Observable to Observable (inner observable) then subscribes to inner observable and emit data into output observable(top_3_rollNum$).
Second  concatMap operator -
top_3_rollNum$ as outer observable.concatMap takes each roll number from the outer observable and hits http request sequentially(here we have 3 inner observables return by 3 http requests) &amp; emits http response data into output observable(topper_marks$).
concatMap never hits the next http request until the previous one completes.
Shorthand syntax for above code

So,concatMap is used where sequence of execution matters.

Nx Devtools recently released version 13.1, which came with a very handy generator for Angular libraries, which creates secondary entrypoints for your Angular Libraries with ease. In this blog post we will cover why and how we should make use of this new function.
By adding secondary entrypoints, we basically split our Angular libraries into multiple chunks, just like Angular Material does.
// One entrypoint: 
import { MatButtonModule, MatCardModule } from &#x27;@angular/material&#x27;;

// With secondary entrypoints:
import { MatButtonModule } from &#x27;@angular/material/button&#x27;;
import { MatCardModule } from &#x27;@angular/material/card&#x27;;
