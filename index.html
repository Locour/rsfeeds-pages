Effects are a powerful model for handling side effects in your application. Commonly this means when you are making a HTTP request in a NgRx powered application you will use an effect to handle the communication with the service but they can do so much more than that. And frankly this is what I usually used them for until I read https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/start-using-ngrx-effects-for-this#handling-the-flow-of-a-angular-material-dialog . 
I became intrigued by the idea of offloading some component material dialog code into the effect and started viewing the life cycle as a series of events and using the effect to talk to other effects.

In this article I will write about the difference between a website and a web application (web app). 
How can you tell the key differences between a website and a web app ? since both the website and the web app are almost similar to each other as both are accessible from your web browsers.

What is a Website?


A website is a page or collection of pages on the World Wide Web (www) that contains specific information which was all provided by one person or entity and traces back to a common Uniform Resource Locator (URL). 
Examples of websites are:
‚Ä¢ www.goggle.com

A website can be accessed on different range of devices such as desktops, laptops and smartphones.

And these are:
default the home of the homeless
kube-system The namespace for objects created by the Kubernetes system
kube-public This namespace is created automatically and is readable by all users (including those not authenticated). This namespace is mostly reserved for cluster usage, in case that some resources should be visible and readable publicly throughout the whole cluster. This is useful for exposing any cluster information necessary to bootstrap components. It is primarily managed by Kubernetes itself.

                    <span>For some reasons, when you are using Helm, the update made with the following command fails.
helm update --install

And when you try another time to do the update, you can have this error : 
Upgrade Failed: xxx has no deployed releases
During the previous update, something wrong happend and stopped the update before all was deployed. So the secret related to the update wasn&#x27;t update with the &quot;deployed&quot; status.
So you need to patch the secret generated by Helm during the last update to change the status to deployed in the labels.
You can do it with an kubectl edit or directly with the following command.
kubectl command
kubectl -n app-namespace patch secret release-name.v1 --type&#x3D;merge -p &#x27;{&quot;metadata&quot;:{&quot;labels&quot;:{&quot;status&quot;:&quot;deployed&quot;}}}&#x27;

                    <span>FreeCodeCamp in our last challenge showed us that React can control the internal state for certain elements like input and textarea, which makes them controlled components. This applies to other forms elements as well including the regular HTML form element.
Here MyForm component is set up with an empty form. As you can see it has the type set tosubmitindicating it is the button controlling the form. They want us to add theinputelement in theformand set itsvalueandonChange()&#x60; attributes like the last post.
&#x60;React
// Change code above this line

}
  render() {
      {/* Change code above this line */}
      Submit!
    
    {/* Change code below this line */}

    {/* Change code above this line */}
  
);

}
}

We should also call &#x60;event.preventDefault() in the submit handler, to prevent default form submit behavior which will refresh the web page.
Lastly they want us to create an h1 tag after theformwhich renders thesubmitvalue from the component&#x27;sstate&#x60;. 


Answer:
&#x60;React




}

  render() {

    return (

      

        

          

          Submit!

        

        
{this.state.submit}

                    <span>Our applications may have more complex interactions between state and the rendered UI. AS you know form control elements for text input such as input and textarea. maintain their own state in the DOM. But with React, we can move this mutable state into a React component&#x27;s state. The user&#x27;s input becomes part of the application state, so React controls the value of that input field.
FreeCodeCamp wants us to view the code editor with a component called ControlledInput to create a controlled input element. First they want us to create a method called handleChange() which has a parameter called event. Then when it&#x27;s called it receives an event object that contains a string of text from input element. We can access this string with event.target.value inside the method.

Today FreeCodeCamp we&#x27;re learning about state. Basically consist of any data our application needs to know about, that can change over time. We want our apps to respond to state changes and present an updated UI necessary. 
We can create state in React component by declaring state property on the component class in its constructor.
Don&#x27;t forget it must be set to a JavaScript object.
Ex:




this.state &#x3D; {

}

We have access to the state object throughout the life of our component. we can either update it, render it in our UI, and pass it as props to child components. We should create a class component by extending React.Component in order to create state like thi‚Ä¶</span>

Docker is an ecosystem of services that are used to create, run and administrate containers.
In simple terms, a container is an isolated environment just for running a particular application. A container essentially contains the application along with all the dependencies and configuration files that it needs for running.
More on that later. First, let&#x27;s see why do we need docker or containerization in particular.
The era of cloud computing sprung up a challenge of managing and maintaining the application over various cloud and development environments.

Open Policy Agent provides a way of declaratively writing policies as code and then using those policies as part of a decision-making process. It uses a policy language called Rego, allowing you to write policies for various different services using the same language.
OPA can be used for a number of purposes, including:
Authorization of REST API endpoints.
Allowing or denying Terraform changes based on compliance or safety rules.
Integrating custom authorization logic into applications.

Centos 6 is end of life as of November 2020. After a bit of discussion, the plan is to continue to investigate if we can do this as a stopgap until the entire solution can be reworked.
So, how would one investigate how to do this? It turns out, it isn&#x27;t so trivial, and even just starting an investigate can be tricky. My first thought was, start a docker instance so I can poke around and try various RPMs.
docker pull centos:6.7

No matter if you are a DevOps/SysOps engineer, developer, or just a Linux enthusiast, you can use Bash scripts to combine different Linux commands and automate boring and repetitive daily tasks, so that you can focus on more productive and fun things.
Here you can find the completed Bash Scripting cheat sheet üëá

Option 2:

                    <span>Time to set up a Linux container on top of Android OS.


This is significantly easier than I expected. Going pack to the zeroth post in this series, I am shocked at how far the community has pushed Android OS to become a desktop replacement OS.
Some of this work was undertaken by corporations. This is most clearly shown by Samsung Dex, a desktop skin of Android that is installed on most of Samsung&#x27;s latest devices. It is still Android under the hood, and it isn&#x27;t perfect either, but it provides a basic, Chromebook-Esque interface to Android. This software package is partly the reason why I chose the Samsung Galaxy S7 Tab as well.
The two apps to start developing in a Linux container on Android OS are:
Termux
AndroidNix

                    <span>What is traditional desktop software?


It depends on who you ask. To me, it is simply:
Audio and video editing
Document processing
Password managers
Web browsers
Video games
Conference software
Development software
Some might add 3d modeling tools, content streaming tools, or maybe torrenting utilities to this list. But for my day-to-day use on a computer, I interact with these software packages the most.
For this tutorial, I won&#x27;t be covering Development software as I will get more involved in setting up and configuring these software packages on Android in a later tutorial. But I will briefly go over a few repositories that contain useful tools that I intend to use.
I also won&#x27;t be going over the specific tools that I intend to use for everything but development. Everyone has their favorite document processor or PDF reader, no point in trying to convince you otherwise.
Have the Google Play Store installed on your device.
Search for any of the keywords listed above in the Google Play Store search bar.
Profit.
And that&#x27;s it. That is the end of part 1 of this roadmap, which again was to install the &quot;vanilla&quot; software of Android. In the next tutorial, I will go over the development setup that I have done.
But if you want to jump the gun on what software I intend to use, checkout Termux on F-Droid.
Termux is the killer app that allows for desktop-class development to happen on Android OS.

                    <span>My story



  
  
  My laptop is dead for the most part.


The radio connections are dropping, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as it used to, all the A/V inputs and outputs are broken, and the laptop doesn&#x27;t display out. Furthermore, the device is approaching its sixth birthday. Sure, I could sit here and debug and fix most of these issues but I just don&#x27;t have the time.
I also don&#x27;t need the power of a laptop as often anymore. I&#x27;m not gaming on it, I don&#x27;t run computationally intensive tasks on it as I have a proper desktop with some big-beefy specs to go along with it, and I never had any intention of holding onto it for this long.
I purchased a base model Samsung Galaxy S7 Tab, the additional keyboard, and a 1TB micro-sd card to try and replace my laptop. Also for Kindle readi‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>What is Docker?


Docker is an ecosystem of services that are used to create, run and administrate containers.
In simple terms, a container is an isolated environment just for running a particular application. A container essentially contains the application along with all the dependencies and configuration files that it needs for running.
More on that later. First, let&#x27;s see why do we need docker or containerization in particular.
The era of cloud computing sprung up a challenge of managing and maintaining the application over various cloud and development environments. Regardless of the underlying platform the application should remain stable and operational. But because of the &#x27;unknown&#x27; associated with running the application on a foreign platform, possibility of environment-specific bu‚Ä¶</span>

IBus Customize @openSUSE by Songlin Jiang (@HollowMan6)


Before GSoC 2021, the IBus theme follows the global GNOME-Shell theme in GNOME and the global GTK theme in other desktop environments, and IBus lacks customization for users in GNOME.
Main Focus
This project aims to make IBus themes separate from the current GNOME-Shell theme and GTK theme so that users can customize it with other GNOME-Shell themes and GTK themes.
Other Goals
Improve the UI usability for IBus in GNOME. That is, to add more features, including customization of orientation, animation, font, opacity. Support right-click to switch the input source or open the tray menu, scroll to switch among pages or candidates, fix candidate box and IME switch list o‚Ä¶</span>

Thanks to Volta, managing multiple versions of Node is no longer a pain.
Under the covers, all the Node version managers are doing the same thing: setting up symlinks to different versions of Node installed on your computer. The difference between them is how they manage those symlinks. If you know the correct version of Node for the project you are currently working on, you can use nvm to set it to the active version, and all is well, as long as you remember to do so. The problem here is that you need to know the correct version of Node. And if you&#x27;re switching from a project that has different Node version requirements, you have to remember to switch each time you open one of those projects. As Wes Bos would say, that&#x27;s no way to live your life. ‚Ä¶</span>

Today we will build a simple REST API with node.js and express.  
Basic knowledge of Javascript
Basic understanding of command line
Installed node.js
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre trying to find videos about Batman on Youtube. You open up Youtube, type ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù into a search field, hit enter, and you see a list of videos about Batman. A REST API works in a similar way. You search for something, and you get a list of results back from the service you‚Äôre requesting from.
An API is an application programming interface. It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other. The developer creates the API on the server and allows the client to talk to it.
REST determines how the API looks like. It stands for ‚ÄúRepresentational State Transfer‚Äù. It is a set of rules‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Would you like to get notified when someone opens your dev.to article or reads your email? Yea that will be awesome. Okay then lets see how we can do that?
Lets talk about Images they are pretty cool right? Imagers are everywhere including in Articles and Emails.
![alt text](https://yoursite.com/some_image)

Or in HTML you&#x27;d use the image tag


and of course the markdown above is later compiled to HTML So lets focus on that.
So when a webpage have an image the browser will send an http request to the URL which is in the src of the image(https://yoursite.com/some_image in our case).
https://yoursite.com will send us and image which will be later shown to us in browser.
https://yoursite.com/ could look something like this
app.get(&quot;/some_image&quot;, (req, res) &#x3D;&gt; {
     res.sendFile(&#x27;some_image.jpg&#x27;)
})

But the question is, is it that all we can do? Well its our code we can do whatever we want. So why not just notify our self that someone viewed this image?
app.get(&quot;/some_image&quot;, (req, res) &#x3D;&gt; {
     notifyUser() //You can implement it the way you want
     res.sendFile(&#x27;some_image.jpg&#x27;)
})

Now we will be notified whenever a user sees our image. That also means that if we use this image in our article/email we will know when a user opens it/reads it.
So if you&#x27;re seeing this image that means ...</span>

The idea behind Golpo is to share links in a uncluttered and ad free platform. It allows user to showcase their creations or just share feelings and likings. 
Currently user can Share links/urls, bookmark them, share comments, love them, follow creators or anyone, chat with them. More features coming soon...
But we need some people to join us, as an open source community to make Golpo a great place to showcase our own works and also share our feelings through links!
Frontend is built on Svelte - https://github.com/Ananto30/golpo-svelte
Backend on Express - https://github.com/Ananto30/golpo-express
We have some tasks on both. But frontend has some priorities. And I will add more daily.
I am also looking for suggestions from designers. üôè

                    <span>When working with frontend framework like Vue or React then most of the time we are required to work with different node versions depending on the projects we have. To easily manage different versions of node and easily switch between then our go to one is nvm.
Now, if you are using M1 Mac and have installed nvm then you might have faced an issue where using the command nvm install 14 is failed to install the desired node version (or any other version).
This can be bit daunting and you can solve this with following steps:
Install Rosetta 2 from the command line with:




softwareupdate --install-rosetta

Go to applications and right-click on iTerm app



Click the checkbox for Open using Rosetta



Now, re-open iTerm app




  
  
  Install desired node version



Now, you should be able to install any desired version. For example to install node version 14 then we can use the following command:




nvm install 14</span>

When it comes to security. There is a lot of guidance and also advice and commentary on why you should or should not use each approach. It&#x27;s hard to understand all the different options and security issues they have.
You also have different clients (mobile/web/app) and each has different security requirements for managing, storing and processing data in the form of tokens, cookies or sessions.
At the end, your app may scale and not all options can be deployed as multiple instance nodes without additional changes to the app and infrastructure.
This means that you really need to make decisions at the beginning and ask questions like: What are your customers? and What are your requirements? and What can be added to the system in the future? and How is it poss‚Ä¶</span>

The original provocation was learning that Photopea, despite financial success as a one-person operation, earns most of its revenue from advertising and only four percent of its revenue from subscriptions or memberships. Considering that I am trying to finance my own sustainability directly via the people using the app, I thought it curious that this income equalled a sort of &#x27;minimum wage&#x27; despite being a well-known, high-traffic project. I don&#x27;t intend or know how to make something as complex and deep as a Photoshop clone, and so I wondered if I would have fewer opportunities than this‚Äîperhaps I need to be open to selling ads at some poin‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>So today let‚Äôs discuss another method of data encryption and decryption using PHP AES-256-CBC and OpenSSL to cipher[encryption] and decipher[decryption] any string in the PHP.
Encryption is a common method to protect data in the cyber world, which converts plain text into a long ciphertext constructed with random alphanumeric characters.
We are using AES Advanced Encryption Standard with 256 bits key length. The following image shows how symmetric key encryption works:

class secureToke
{
    private static $secretKey &#x3D; &#x27;Your Desired key(Alphanumeric)&#x27;;
    private static $secretIv &#x3D; &#x27;www.domain.com&#x27;;
    private static $encryptMethod &#x3D; &quot;AES-256-CBC&quot;;
    public static function tokenencrypt($data)
    {
        $key &#x3D; hash(&#x27;sha256&#x27;, self::$secretKey);
        $iv &#x3D; substr(hash(&#x27;sha256&#x27;, self::$secretIv), 0, 16);
        $result &#x3D; openssl_encrypt($data, self::$encryptMethod, $key, 0, $iv);
        return $result &#x3D; base64_encode($result);
    }
    public static function tokendecrypt($data)
    {
        $key &#x3D; hash(&#x27;sha256&#x27;, self::$secretKey);
        $iv &#x3D; substr(hash(&#x27;sha256&#x27;, self::$secretIv), 0, 16);
        $result &#x3D; openssl_decrypt(base64_decode($data), self::$encryptMethod, $key, 0, $iv);
        return $result;
    }
}

Encryption method:
$tokenencrypt &#x3D; secureToken::tokenencrypt($token);

Decryption method:
$tokendecrypt &#x3D; secureToken::tokendecrypt($encryptedtoken);

Voila! it‚Äôs done‚Ä¶ Now you can encrypt your entire data on the webspace and make them secure. üôÇ</span>

                    <span>Lately, I&#x27;ve been looking for a better way to write clean conditional rendering code instead of ternary and &amp;&amp; operators and even if statements, because sometimes they can be confusing and I found that I can write the same functionality with objects, it makes the code more readable. let&#x27;s see how we can write a well-typed object to render a component based on the parent component state and props
export default function Products({state}:ProductsStateEnum)
:ReactElement {
const [_ProductsState, setProductsState] &#x3D; useState(state)
  const ProductsState: { [key in ProductsStateEnum]: ReactElement } &#x3D; {
    loading: ,
    failed: (
      
Somethig Went Wrong
      
 (
            
          )
        )}
      
    )
  }

  return 
{ProductsState[_ProductsState]}
}

We notice here that we didn&#x27;t write any if statement or any operator, based on the state the component will render the React component with key that&#x27;s equal to the _ProductsState,  tell me if you know another way to write readable conditional rendering options!</span>

                    <span>Component libraries are all the rage. Shopify, Salesforce, IBM, and even the United States government have joined countless other organizations and businesses in building component libraries. They&#x27;re the subject of blog posts, podcasts, and YouTube tutorials. All that&#x27;s left is a Ken Burns documentary on the subject.
In fact, I am a software architect and senior engineer, and I currently lead the development of a React component library that will be the basis for the UIs for a prominent US government agency. I want to share with you my lessons learned in project management, communications, accessibility, engineering, and testing to build something that will impact the lives of millions. And the ups and downs of it all.
So what&#x27;s the big deal with component libraries?

&quot;Dead code&quot; is code that is never used. It is not referenced by any other code, it is not imported, it is not used in the final build in any way.
Refactoring a project to make certain types, methods, or properties obsolete without removing that obsolete code will create dead code. Changing the direction of a project, like choosing to use a different API or library can also produce dead code. On large projects with many different teams and shifting priorities, the occurrence of dead code is inevitable.
There are many reasons why you should delete dead code. There are many effects that dead code can have on a large project:
Dead code must be compiled, which slows down the compilation time. It ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>The problem


In Javascript, arrays are without a doubt one of the most broadly used data structures. That&#x27;s why we need as many built-in methods as possible to manipulate the arrays the way we want. Javascript evolves and almost every new ES specification brings us some new array methods making it easier and easier to work with arrays. One of my favorite new ones is Array.prototype.at which makes getting the last element of an array so simple!
Instead of
const lastElement &#x3D; array[array.length - 1]

we can do:
const lastElement &#x3D; array.at(-1)


The problem with array methods is well known to every developer. The thing is, some array methods mutate the original array but some don&#x27;t. I challenge you to guess if Array.prototype.slice mutates or not? And what about Array.prototype.splice? I ca‚Ä¶</span>

  );
}

From my point of view it&#x27;s easier to understand and maintain the components when the bits are named in such a way that it&#x27;s clear what is the role of the component. It&#x27;s basically decoupling what the component looks like from what it represents in the interface.

                    <span>Hello all!


Welcome back to my Learning Typescript series! Or should I say &quot;our&quot; series? Because we are all pupils to this crazy world of coding and I am just here sharing that growth with everyone. In the past articles, we laid a tremendous foundation. We are going to continue that foundation as we dive a little bit deeper into the knowledge we have gained so far. Read on, and keep keeping on.
                         LETTUCE BEGINü•¨


We have learned about multiple types that are inherited through Javascript in the form of primitive types. There are some other types that we are going to jump on, as well as learn more about the types we have already seen. 
With some basic programming knowledge, you&#x27;ll know that an array is a collection of elements enclosed in [ ] brackets. We set up an A‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>An endless story, yeah? Oke, let&#x27;s start with some introduction


If you ask someone why sometimes JS is so confusing, probably one of the reasons is varüò© declaration. 
That was my experience too in 2017 when I had my first contact with JS. It was post-ES6(ES2015), which means the let and const were there. 
&quot;lucky me, var is history and now we live in a new era&quot; üôå. Guess what happened? Yeah, I was hit by a var bug in the face. TKO üëäüòµ, not stand a chance.
It&#x27;s true that with ES2015 we have great alternatives for declarations in letüî• and constüî•, but it is also important to know how var works (and pray we do not go into it üôè   ).
Now, why are let and const such a great option? Well, let&#x27;s see! üëá

I&#x27;m writing this so you don&#x27;t make the same mistake as our team.
This started out great.
In retrospect, we now know that we had created a false sense of security.
To give a simple example, a lot of our code to create a new instance of a type looked like this.
// inline
const customer &#x3D; { customerId: newid(), name: &#x27;Sarah&#x27; } as Customer;
// or a variant with angle brackets
const customer &#x3D; { customerId: newid(), name: &#x27;Sarah&#x27; };

// even better, via a factory method
function createCustomer(name: string) {
    return { customerId: newid(), names } as Customer;
}

The code has two problems concerning the correctness of these objects when the respective type is changed:
new properties that are required aren&#x27;t caught;
existing properties that are removed aren&#x27;t flagged;
The simple fix is to ditch the type assertions and to replace them with type annotations and return types.
// inline
const customer: Customer &#x3D; { customerId: newid(), name: &#x27;Sarah&#x27; };

// even better, via a factory method
function createCustomer(name: string): Customer {
    return { customerId: newid(), names };
}

With the updated snippet, we now get correct and helpful compile errors when the type is modified.
To enforce this practice, you can enable the ESLint rule Enforces consistent usage of type assertions (consistent-type-assertions).
Fiddle with this example in the following TypeScript playground.

Yes, you can make an app given that your website has RSS support and you are ready to do some set-up process.
dev.to/[username] into an app).
Basically, it&#x27;s an app that takes your website&#x27;s RSS feed and displays it in a nice app UI.
For my fellow dev&#x27;s out there, I have used Firebase, Django, expo and few more technology. You can check out the code in the github repo.
Ever wanted to reach out to your readers and notify about some updates. if yes, then this app has got you covered, it has Push Notification support.
Want to know how many users log-in and out of your app. we have got you covered, Custom Analytics(basic).
Note: You can add your own Analytics service provider, if 
App has Guest login, save for later, and much more.
Currently there is no ad&#x27;s in the app, So there is no revenue generated from this app.
if you are an expo dev then you can add your own ad service.(if you want to)
Yep, its an open-source project.
At first everything that i have used is free but if u want to scale it up or your readers go crazy with the app. then you might have to pay (not to me but to Heroku or Firebase).
You can learn more about the app and its features here.
Thanks for reading. hope you like it. Peace Out</span>

Public key cryptography is one of the fundamental technologies that enables the XRP Ledger and other blockchain systems to operate.
It uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. Anyone can create a new account and have authority to sign transactions from that account. In order to generate these keys, you can use a software library like ripple-keypairs.
Many of the applications that integrate with the XRP Ledger depend on the stability and security of ripple-keypairs in order to create and use XRP Ledger accounts.
Each account has an address, which is derived from the account&#x27;s master public key. It might also have a regular key, which is a secondary way to authorize transactions from an account.

                    <span>RxJS 7 has shipped! For us Angular developers, it unfortunately did not ship in time for Angular 12.
I&#x27;ve summarized key takeaways from Ben Lesh‚Äôs talk from RxJS Live Asia and his slides below. Lesh is a member of the RxJS core team and formerly worked at Google on the Angular team.
Lesh said while RxJS 7 was ‚Äúa bit faster,‚Äù the big improvement for the new version is its bundle size. RxJS 7 is 53% the size of RxJS 6. If your app used every operator in version 6, that would require 52 KB, but the same thing in RxJS 7 requires just 19 KB.

Having worked with BroadcastChannel in the past (see HERE), I set about creating a service to handle this functionality.
First, I needed an interface ...
export interface BroadcastMessage {
  type: string;

Then, there&#x27;s the code ...
import { Injectable } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;

Instead of trying to solve the problems of too many failing, complex and costly abstractions by adding even more complexity and bloat, let&#x27;s try to move into the opposite direction.
In his article from 1975, How do we tell truths that might hurt?, Edsger W. Dijkstra said &quot;Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability&quot;. These words are now more important than ever.

So you know about bash and zsh and how they work right? The fish shell is not like those shells. I mean they kinda have similarities but they do differ very much. ZSH can execute bash commands in a native as bash does but fish shell requires some editing to it specially when it comes to setting variables and exporting paths.

I usually work on the terminals only and for that I frequent switch between different directories, editing them in vim (I use neovim), etc. So for me having a built-in autocompletion for shell with syntax highlighting and is a plus point.

  A Yummy Analogy


Imagine you have ordered your favorite pizza of large size. You see, the pizza is divided into 8 slices. Assuming you are kind enough to share the pizza with 3 of your friends, each of you gets 2 slices each. Now let‚Äôs observe the following:
Cost savings: You can buy one whole pizza, and share it among 4 people
Isolation: What you do with your slice of pizza has no effect whatsoever on your friend‚Äôs slice.
Efficient pizza sharing: If one of your friends wants to eat 3 slices, and another one just wants one, it can be done.
Compare it with buying a large pizza that you are not able to eat all by yourself and 5 pieces of it going to waste, or a plate of dessert that you have to share with‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been coding in Node.js for some time, it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;ve used or at least heard of dotenv.
Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
It&#x27;s one of the must-have libraries which I install in nearly all of my projects, until I published typed-dotenv last year.
Instead of explaining the difference between dotenv and typed-dotenv, let&#x27;s feel it by seeing how we write my-api-client.js differently.

                    <span>When selling your computer or returning it to your employer, then you should make sure to securely erase the data of your hard drive to prevent unauthorized access to it.
Simply deleting your sensitive files via the system menu is often not sufficient as professional data recovery tools may be able to restore them. In order to guarantee irrevocable deletion, it is recommended to erase the entire contents of your disk and overwrite it several times with random data. 
There are several data erasure standards, like the DoD 5220.22-M from the American Department of Defense, that define how data is securely deleted. In this article, I am showing you how to nuke all of your data according to such a standard.

&quot;Let‚Äôs use a token to secure this API call. Should I use the ID token or the access token? ‚Äãü§î The ID token looks nicer to me. After all, if I know who the user is, I can make better authorization decisions, right?&quot;
Have you ever found yourself making similar arguments? Choices based on your intuition may sound good, but what looks intuitive is not always correct. In the case of ID and access tokens, they have clear and well-defined purposes, so you should use them based on that. Using the wrong token can result in your solution being insecure.
&quot;What changes after all? They are just tokens. I can use them as I see fit. What‚Äôs the worst that could happen?&quot;
Let‚Äôs take a closer look at these two types of tokens to better understand their role in authentication and authorization processes.
An ID token is an artifact that proves that the user has been authenticated. It was introduced by OpenID Connect (OIDC), an open standard for authentication used by many identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and, of course, Auth0. Check out this document for more details on OpenID Connect. Let&#x27;s take a quick look at the problem OIDC wants to resolve.
Consider the following diagram:

Here, a user with their browser authenticates against an OpenID provider and gets access to a web application. The result of that authentication process based on OpenID Connect is the ID token, which is passed to the application as proof that the user has been authenticated.
This provides a very basic idea of what an ID token is: proof of the user&#x27;s authentication. Let‚Äôs see some other details.
An ID token is encoded as a JSON Web Token (JWT), a standard format that allows your application to easily inspect its content, and make sure it comes from the expected issuer and that no one else changed it. If you want to learn more about JWTs, check out The JWT Handbook.

Hi and welcome to my post. In this one I am going to go through what a JWT is, how to create one and manage it using Azure AD and Postman.

Introduction

Authentication Flows
I&#x27;ll go thorough how we can do this using Postman.
Client Credentials
Implicit grant
Authorization code grant
Refresh
Resource owner credentials grant
Set-up

Backend AAD App
 For the first step all we need to do is fill in the name of the app and click register. In other flows you might also need to fill in the redirect Uri as well, this is so that the token response can go back to the client.
 Afterwards we need to add a scope to the app registration. It doesn&#x27;t really matter what you call it. Something meaningful is alw‚Ä¶</span>

Authentication
It is recommended to use an IdP server as a provider for user authentication to the Kubernetes API (for example, using OIDC) Cluster administrators are advised not to use service account tokens for authentication.
It is recommended to use a centralized certificate management service to manage certificates within the cluster (for user and service purposes)
User accounts should be personalized. The names of the service accounts should reflect the purpose access rights of the accounts.
Authorization
For each cluster, a role-based access model should be developed.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) should be configured for the Kubernetes cluster. Rights need to be assigned within the project namespace based on least privilege a‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>RxJS 7 has shipped! For us Angular developers, it unfortunately did not ship in time for Angular 12.
I&#x27;ve summarized key takeaways from Ben Lesh‚Äôs talk from RxJS Live Asia and his slides below. Lesh is a member of the RxJS core team and formerly worked at Google on the Angular team.
Lesh said while RxJS 7 was ‚Äúa bit faster,‚Äù the big improvement for the new version is its bundle size. RxJS 7 is 53% the size of RxJS 6. If your app used every operator in version 6, that would require 52 KB, but the same thing in RxJS 7 requires just 19 KB.
‚ÄúThis was done via a refactor, a hundred-point improvement of going around and individually moving around code, keeping the same tests, keeping the same code, and moving things around slowly but surely until we got to a place where we could see daylight and‚Ä¶</span>

A question comes in mind that how it works internally. It works like there is a big list say 10k items are there. Displaying all those items in once is not possible as it will break the application.

  Generic CRUD Service


Before we start generating and writing code, let‚Äôs take a step back and see the bigger picture. The generic service should accept the following arguments:
the HttpClient is used for the HTTP requests
the class of model for creating instances
the path of the API endpoints.
Also, all resources should have 5 main methods related to CRUD‚Ä¶
Create - Returns a new resource.
