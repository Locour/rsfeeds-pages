                    <span>A well-designed microservices architecture is an amazing thing. When each service is responsible for its own specific domain and can be deployed independently, it allows for unparalleled flexibility and productivity for backend teams. However, very few decisions are all benefit with no cost - including our decision to choose microservices over a monolithic backend. 
Before we migrated our backend to GraphQL, one trade-off that we encountered was the additional complexity that it imposed on our client-side networking code - especially when we had to create views that used data from multiple services.
For example, our application had a &quot;appointment list&quot; view that looked a little something like this:

In a monolithic architecture, the networking code for this page could be trivial. It would …</span>

                    <span>The Shopping List project is open source and you can find it on GitHub.
There, you are going to find instructions on how to build it and how to run it locally.
The frontend is written in Angular and the backend in Quarkus. The database is PostgreSQL. They are deployed as containers on Heroku and the HTTP communication is protected by JWT tokens.
I describe the technique used to deploy them as containers on Heroku in this article on medium.
You can access this demo version running on Heroku and try it right now. But as this is only a demo, please don&#x27;t use a real password there!
The application get dormant after some time without use, so the first access can take some extra time.

Shopping List is a web application that was created especially for mobile devices.
You&#x27;ll be able to organize the products you want to buy and do your shopping more quickly.
Once you create one account, you can create shopping lists and add products to them.
When you&#x27;re buying products at the market, you can check the products updating your list and switch from one shopping list to other very easily.
You can, for instance, create one shopping list for fruits, other for cleaning products and another for grocery. So, in the top menu, you will be able to switch between these shopping lists while you&#x27;re checking the products you already bought.

Application
API swagger
I used Angular Material and Angular Flex-Layout in this project.
On the Quarkus project I used Hibernate Panache to control the database and SmallRye JWT to protect the endpoints.
Perhaps you can find it interesting the Swagger-UI, created automatically by the SmallRye OpenAPI, that has the possibility of doing one Authentication to test the endpoints protected by JWT.
Thanks for reading this article and feel free to talk with me in case you got interested in this project!</span>

  Generic CRUD Model


Once we have walked about the theory of generics (Part 1) and we have understand the main CRUD methods (Part 2), now it&#x27;s time to see it in action.
Before start to implement the generic service of CRUD. We must define the generic model of all resources.
In this article, we assume that all models have some common properties like id, createdAt, and updatedAt.
Thus, we create a generic abstract class that contains all these common properties.

                    <span>Building your own blogging platform is no small feat. From picking the stack you want to use, along with CSS solutions, to how you&#x27;re going to organize your content are all the decisions that you have to make. I have gone down this path a few times with my own blog built with just Angular, and Angular and Scully, and hosted solutions like Dev.to. I continue to want something with low-friction so that I could get my thoughts out and be able to write blog posts more quickly about things that I&#x27;ve learned along the way or things that I&#x27;m tinkering with. This post is how I started on a different path, ended up rebuilding my blog and became an Astronaut 🚀.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s see how easy it is to add heatmaps to tables in Angular using Directives. We&#x27;ll go for a really simple and elegant solution to have separate heatmap colors to different columns in the table.
As I always say, Directives are a really powerful feature of Angular. It can be used as an elegant solution to implement a lot of cool functionalities. You can clearly see why the directive approach makes more sense when you reach the end of the post.
Even though it&#x27;s not that often we see heatmaps in tables, but heatmaps can really add some value in terms of visualization. It would make sense in data sets where there is some kind of comparison or range.

If you have this question in mind, here are some reasons which justify why creating a directive for implementing this feature will make sense.

                    <span>A Story Told Over and Over


I&#x27;ve been a part of a number of different Angular front end projects in the past years. In every one of those projects, there came a point in time where we were asked to implement:
When a call to the backend fails due to authentication errors (401), route the user to the login page.
It didn&#x27;t take long until another use case arrived:
When a call to the backend fails, alert the user of the failure with a generic &quot;The requested operation failed&quot;.
Soon after, another use case:
When the user tries to get the information of an existing contact, and the operation fails, display a toast &quot;Contact not found&quot;.
This would escalate further when the same operation failure would need a different error handling when done from different components. 
If the user tries to edit a…</span>

When you&#x27;re building a successful pipeline, you need to ensure that:
All code prerequisites and dependencies are met (libraries, modules, packages, etc.)
You understand the ins and outs of the CICD platform you&#x27;re using. Although the technology itself is always the same, the different CICD platform features and requirements can vary.
All engineers understand what the pipeline is doing
Different stages are available (dev, staging/UAT, prod) for testing purposes to ensure the code being deployed is ready for production

Before removing the particular container we have to stop the container and then we can remove it

We don&#x27;t need to stop the pod before removing, k8s take care of it.

Some might install automation tools, others might use source code control. Me, wanting to try out something new, stumbled upon a very sleek looking cloud IDE called goormIDE. 
Trying it out, I found out that goormIDE is an easily configurable cloud IDE that is very customizable and easy to use for beginners (like myself).
This post will cover how we can use goormIDE to easily install zsh(Oh My Zsh) and zsh-autosuggestions on ubuntu 18.04.

                    <span>Continuous integration is cheap, but not integrating continuously can be very expensive. Nowdays, it&#x27;s hard to imagine software development lifecycle without automated solutions that take care of all those repetitive tasks. There is a ton of different technologies that can solve our problems and in this post we will focus on GitHub Actions.
GitHub Actions are event-driven workflows that come right in your code repository. By saying event-driven, it means that you can execute series of commands when specific event occurs. For example, every time someone creates a pull request for a repository, you can automatically run a command that executes a software testing script. Aside from event trigger, procedure can also be scheduled.
Procedures are defined in YAML file called workflow. Workflow co…</span>

                    <span>Application deployment with Docker and Kubernetes is easier than ever before, but could it even be much faster and much more seamless? This is where Compose Generator comes into play by helping you with common Docker tasks with a command line interface.

With Compose Generator you only have to do the following four steps:
Install Compose Generator (instructions below)
Clone repository of your project from a VCS
Run compose-generator install to install Docker and Docker Compose (can be skipped if you have Docker and Docker Compose already installed)
Runcompose-generator -r to generate your deployment configuration and run it subsequently

Lets dive a bit further into Compose Generator to better point out the various advantages and why you should consider using it.

                    <span>As we all know, the internet has become our necessity today, and the services hosted on it are those we have become accustomed to. Cloud computing is one of those. Some of the skills that we are required to learn today are like AWS, and becoming certified in this field is better for future prospects. Some of the reasons that learning the AWS course is the best choice are given below:
AWS is an abbreviation for Amazon Web Services, a cloud platform that allows businesses or individuals to host their applications or data in the cloud. It is very cost-effective and helps them grow faster. According to records, AWS held more than 32% of the market share in cloud computing services in Q1 2021.

If you&#x27;ve ever had to do the above, then this scenario may sound familiar to you: You already have an existing build file, you wish to change some environment variables, then re-deploy it to a new environment.
Unfortunately, you soon realize that the environment variables have been hard-coded within the build file. This means that you cannot change the environment variables without re-building.
Are there any other ways to modify environment variables?
We asked around to see if the other projects had a better way to handle it. It turned out that different teams had their own approach:
Some teams simply re-built it for each environment
Some teams fetched the environment variables asynchronously from an external data…</span>

                    <span>Merhabalar, bugün benim de karşılaşmış olduğum ufak bir sorunun çözümünü sizlere sunacağım. Umarım faydalı olur.
Bu hata ile karşı karşılaşanlar genelde aşağıdaki iki komutu çalıştırdığında karşılaşmakta:
hostnamectl
timedatectl
Komutlar çalıştırıldığında ise aşağıdaki gibi bir output döndürmekteler.

Bu sorunu çözebilmek için öncelikle dbus adlı servisin çalıştığından emin olunmalıdır.
systemctl status dbus

Eğer bu komut sonrası dönüt aşağıdaki gibi ise servisin bulunmadığını söylemektedir.

Bu durumda aşağıdaki komut ile servis yüklenir:
apt install dbus

Sonrasında servis otomatik olarak active hale gelmiş olabilir. Yine de kesinlik kazandırmak için servisi başlatmalı ve &quot;enable&quot; hale getirmeliyiz. Böylelikle makine her başladığında çalışır duruma gelebilmektedir.
systemctl start dbus
systemctl enable dbus

Eğer &quot;systemctl status dbus&quot; komutunun dönütü aşağıdaki gibi ise servis bulunmakta fakat aktif olmadığı anlamına gelmektedir.

Servis aktif edilir:
systemctl start dbus

Böylelikle dbus servisi sorunu çözümlenmiş olur. Eğer bu işlemlere rağmen çözüm sağlanılmamış ise bunun sebebi /var/run ile /run arasındaki gerekli symbolic linkin bozulmuş olması olabilir. Bunun için aşağıdaki komutlar çalıştırılır ve servisin durumuna bakılır:
sudo rm /var/run -R
sudo ln -s /run /var
sudo reboot</span>

Setting up codecs is the crucial part of encoding media assets. You will usually want to either keep source file’s encoding or apply a new encoder.
There are so many available codecs that ffmpeg supports. Below examples are some of the most popular combos that have been used in a number of different commercial projects.

                    <span>Hi, let&#x27;s start with a recap:
We have a pnpm-based monorepo that contains two apps and three libraries.
All those packages are Dockerized.
A GitHub Actions pipeline builds all packages on each commit.
Today we&#x27;ll laser-focus on solving the issues we identified in the previous blog:
Don&#x27;t reinstall dependencies if only source-code has changed, it wastes a lot of time.
Don&#x27;t manually specify which individual packages to copy, it&#x27;s a mess to maintain.
Final images should not contain dev-dependencies, they should be as tidy and optimal as possible.
Read the previous blog for more details on how those issues came about, but now let&#x27;s see about solving them.
Converging on a plan
Custom Context Script
Dockerfile


Cache the pnpm store
Strip dev-dependencies
Updating the CI Script

By the end of this tutorial, you&#x27;ll be able to run npm run expose which will both start your app and give it a public URL.
In most cases, you won&#x27;t need to do any firewall or networking config to make this work, because the traffic to the public URLs will automatically be tunneled through most networks and firewalls.

                    <span>Hello, Today we will create a demo in nodejs where image will be resize of the required dimension. As we need to generate thumbnail images in the application where we think all aspect to improve the performace of the application. A very basic steps are needed to perform the task. In nodejs applicationi it is verydifficult to resize or compress the image while uploading with multer package(in case of uploading file to our own server).
Click here to get complete working code.
For the image compression task we will use imagemagick package of nodejs. So at first we have to install imagemagick in our system, I am using linux with ubuntu. sudo apt-get install imagemagick will install the software in our system.
Now create a file named server.js and create a basic app of nodejs. I am not adding much thing here in the demo to clear the actual concept for image compression task in nodejs application. So I have written very basic code in my demo. Lets have a look in code of my package.json.

{
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;node-resize-example&quot;,
    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
    &quot;dependencies&quot;: {
       &quot;imagemagick&quot;: &quot;0.1.2&quot;
   }
}

In the above file we can see that only one npm package has been installed.
Now move to the next file, server.js. Lets have a look inside it.
var im &#x3D; require(&#x27;imagemagick&#x27;)
, path &#x3D; require(&#x27;path&#x27;)

let convertArgs &#x3D; [
&#x27;./images/tes.jpg&#x27;,
&#x27;-resize&#x27;,
300 + &#x27;x&#x27; + 300,
&#x27;./images/thumbnail_test.jpg&#x27;
];

im.convert(convertArgs, function(err, metadata){
if (err) throw err;

console.log(&#x27;success! Checkout your new thumb: &#x27;);
});

In the above file at top we have required the node packages. below that we have created a variable named convertArgs having first value as the current image second and value as the required size of thumbnail/resized images and last value as the name of the new file. At the end we call the convert method of imagemagick which  is performing the actual task. By following these easy steps we can compress/resize image in our nodejs app.

                    <span>If you’re building an app and you want to allow users to livestream video directly to youtube you will need to work with the Youtube Live Streaming API. It can be super daunting to use this API, because of the multiple steps required and the lack of snippets on the internet that you can use. I had some issues working with this API so I asked a question on Stack Overflow. After some trial and error and being ignored, I solved my own problem and posted the answer to my own question.
I am writing this because I couldn’t find anyone doing this with Javascript on the client and so I hope this will help others.
Let’s get started. To create a livestream first you should peruse the API documentation to get familiar with some of the terminology. To go live there are several steps: 1) authenticate t…</span>

This article describes how you can implement a customized alert handler. This is currently an undocumented and most likely an unknown feature of InterSystems SAM. With future releases it will be probably made easier to leverage this useful concept.
In the interest of shortness, I will only mention InterSystems IRIS in this article, but the following applies to InterSystems IRIS and InterSystems IRIS For Health.

We think a lot about login boxes. 
But you would be surprised by just how much your customers are thinking about them as well.
Now, we would say that, since we are in the business of making login boxes. So that’s why we went out and asked people what they thought: more than 17,000 global technology leaders and consumers across 12 global markets: United States, United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Singapore, Japan, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.

                    <span>Hello, Developers!
As I’m developing my products (the latest one being BotMeNot), I often wonder - do people actually mind data being scraped from their websites?
On the one hand, it’s publicly available information - meaning it’s up for grabs for any visitor. I’ve even read some people saying that if you don’t want information being collected from your website - don’t put it on the website in the first place. Do you agree or is this too harsh of a stance in your opinion?
On the other hand, it’s a very automated process of information gathering. Web scrapers are far more efficient than humans can ever hope to be. Does this make a difference to you?
Also, even if you’re not a website owner, please share your opinion!</span>

Luckily, there is a tool that not only can do it for us, but it is also powerful, really easy to use, and you can start with it for free! Datree.
Today I&#x27;m going to tell you everything about it: how to install it, what it can do for us, how to use it locally and in our CI systems, and of course why we would want to use it.

VM has following public/private IP

Private endpoint assigns Private IP address to the Azure resource. By having private IP address in particular subnet, any other component can access to the service by using the private IP address rather than Microsoft assigned public IP address.
Unlike Service Endpoint, Private Endpoint is Azure resource we need to provision. Let&#x27;s do it.
1. From Add Resources menu, create private endpoint.

2. Give it a name and region where VNET is located.

In this article, I will explain how Service Endpoint works.
Azure SQL
V-NET and subnets
VM with SSMS (SQL Server Management Service)

VM has following public/private IP

When I access Azure SQL from VM now, I see VM tries to use its Public IP address to access Azure SQL and it&#x27;s blocked by SQL Server firewall.

I can configure SQL Server firewall to allow the specific IP.

When we use service endpoint, VM uses its private IP rather than public IP to access Azure resources. 
There are several ways to create service endpoint, and I explain one of them.

Password, key, or identification is the most broadly used and is one of the most important tools used by organizations to authenticate applications and users, providing them with sensitive systems, information, and services. Because secrets have to be transmitted securely, secret management has to account for and mitigate the risks to these secrets both in transit and at rest.
In this tutorial, we will create a simple lambda function,
Tokens, passwords, and keys are the most broadly used form of authentication for authenticating users and other applications before they can access any other service on your application or collect any sensitive information that they would need. Notwithstanding, hackers are on the loose looking for systems that they can exploit from time to time, and…</span>

                    <span>TLDR; Jump to the conclusions.
We have been told that a robust static type system can reduce the number of bugs in our applications, transforming a 2 a.m. production issue into a red squiggly in our text editor. This is an appealing proposition.
In this post, we will set the stage with some definition, a scenario, and a goal and see how this little adventure goes. We will then try to draw some conclusions.
A dynamic type system is a system where types are checked at runtime.
A static type system is a system where types are checked at compile time.
Let&#x27;s imagine that our code needs a simple function that returns the last element of an array (let&#x27;s call it &quot;last&quot;).
Our goal is to have a system that would warn us if we try to call this function with anything other than an array and also ensur…</span>

It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;ve never worked with Decorators, of course I have, especially Angular and Nest, but I never bothered to understand how they work. So I decided to get down to let&#x27;s do it. And the truth is, it is easier than it seems.
A decorator is nothing more than a &quot;typical&quot; Javascript/Typescript function what to add additional functionalities to a declaration. When we say declaration, we mean classes, methods, parameters, accessor (getter) and properties. Now, we are going to explain each one of them.
Note: You will have noticed, that at no time did we mention functions, this is so because the main problem is dealing with the elevation of functions. Any attemp…</span>

This article is a part of a series about how to create Generic CRUD Service &amp; Models in Angular:
Part 1 - Understanding Generics
Part 2 - What is CRUD?

  Generic CRUD Model


Once we have walked about the theory of generics (Part 1) and we have understand the main CRUD methods (Part 2), now it&#x27;s time to see it in action.
Before start to implement the generic service of CRUD. We must define the generic model of all resources.
In this article, we assume that all models have some common properties like id, createdAt, and updatedAt.
Thus, we create a generic abstract class that contains all these common properties.

                    <span>Hi, let&#x27;s start with a recap:
We have a pnpm-based monorepo that contains two apps and three libraries.
All those packages are Dockerized.
A GitHub Actions pipeline builds all packages on each commit.
Today we&#x27;ll laser-focus on solving the issues we identified in the previous blog:
Don&#x27;t reinstall dependencies if only source-code has changed, it wastes a lot of time.
Don&#x27;t manually specify which individual packages to copy, it&#x27;s a mess to maintain.
Final images should not contain dev-dependencies, they should be as tidy and optimal as possible.
Read the previous blog for more details on how those issues came about, but now let&#x27;s see about solving them.
Converging on a plan
Custom Context Script
Dockerfile


Cache the pnpm store
Strip dev-dependencies
Updating the CI Script
Conclusion

                    <span>TypeScript has become extremely popular among JavaScript developers and more and more projects use it as the primary programming language.
Today, most frameworks or libraries have support for TypeScript, which makes it easy to use.
JavaScript/TypeScript can be executed on every platform. You can now use TypeScript for all your projects without any limitation: one programming language to rule them all!

It also means you only need to learn one programming language for all your projects. For any senior developer learning a new programming language isn&#x27;t difficult but the time to master one is time-consuming.
You only need to use one ecosystem: one package manager, one linter, one code formatter, etc. You only need to configure once and share it across all your projects. Saving you a ton of t…</span>

                    <span>Let&#x27;s see how easy it is to add heatmaps to tables in Angular using Directives. We&#x27;ll go for a really simple and elegant solution to have separate heatmap colors to different columns in the table.
As I always say, Directives are a really powerful feature of Angular. It can be used as an elegant solution to implement a lot of cool functionalities. You can clearly see why the directive approach makes more sense when you reach the end of the post.
Even though it&#x27;s not that often we see heatmaps in tables, but heatmaps can really add some value in terms of visualization. It would make sense in data sets where there is some kind of comparison or range.

If you have this question in mind, here are some reasons which justify why creating a directive for implementing this feature will make sense.

I will assume you already have heard about the term Continuous Delivery and there is many definitions out there but the simplest is CD is a set of tools and processes that helps DevOps teams to ship higher quality software, faster.
The official definition for AWS CDK is an open source software development framework to define your cloud application resources (Infrastructure) using familiar programming languages (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java and C#).
Basically we can compare the CDK with Serverless framework, AWS SAM, and Terraform. A…</span>

                    <span>While refactoring your javascript/typescript code it&#x27;s easy to remove things but forget to get rid of the unused imports.

In VSCode, you can easily remove these with the shortcut : Shift + Alt + O. 
In VSCode, go to File -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Settings and click on the icon in the top right hand corner to open up the settings in JSON.

Add the following json:
&quot;editor.codeActionsOnSave&quot;: {
    &quot;source.organizeImports&quot;: true
},

So that it looks something like the following: 

Et voilà! 
Your imports will now be organized every time you save a file.

  On layered architecture 🍰


Layering is not a novel concept. It&#x27;s been around in the industry for more than a couple of years (some of you reading this document are probably younger than layering) and it&#x27;s one of the first architectural styles created. In short, layering is nothing more than dividing the concerns of your application into different layers, like in a cake, where the upper layers can talk to the bottom layers but no the other way around.
Layers interact through facades, so as long as the public APIs are honored, a layer doesn&#x27;t have to know anything about internal implementation details of other layers.
Let&#x27;s take a look at the following diagram:

                    <span>Idea


The primary idea is to have everything set up for quick start with components, modules and other stuff which many templates can&#x27;t offer.
The core of this template is build around next dependencies:
React Native
React Native Navigation
Redux ToolKit
TypeScript
One of the main differences between this and any other template is that it offers a documentation to each of its component, helper, module, etc.
It offers more than just a simple template project it offers a guidance towards project, module, component creation.
From the component to publishing an app, it covers each aspect of development.
From the beginning it includes Hermes on both platforms, proguard is enabled, consoles are being removed and many other enhancements are used to provide the best performance.

                    <span>In this tutorial, we will learn how to manage object in FormControl and handle conversion for input
Generally we use FormControl with either string or boolean types and hence it manages only simple values. But what if we want to manage just more than primitive data types? We can do that, let’s see how.
For example, in this tutorial we will learn how to get country-code and number as separate entities from the same form-control, and we will also create custom input for the same to handle the conversion between UI and value.
Let’s assume that we have a Telephone class, which will hold the related values:
export class Telephone {
  constructor(
    public countryCode: string,
    public phoneNumber: string
  ) {}
}

Next, let’s take an input[type&#x3D;tel] in which we want to hold the Telephone:

                    <span>I was playing around and testing some stuff in Linux when i suddenly did a tweak which changed how my WSL terminal opens up. This is what my terminal looks like - notice it doesn&#x27;t the distinct green + blue colors.

After some searching I found two articles (links at the bottom) which describes the &quot;sequence&quot; which Unix follows when reading files. As summary, here&#x27;s the files (in order):
/etc/profile
~/.bash_profile
~/.bash_login
4 ~/.profile
I added the function for .bashrc at the top of the .bash_profile:
## Loads .bashrc
if [[ -f ~/.bashrc ]] ; then
        . ~/.bashrc
fi

Closed terminal and reopened it 

Adding this great explanation from the reference link:
By default, Terminal starts the shell via /usr/bin/login, which makes the shell a login shell. On every platform (not just Mac OS X) bash does not use .bashrc for login shells (only /etc/profile and the first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile that exists and is readable). This is why &quot;put source ~/.bashrc in your .bash_profile&quot; is standard advice
Why doesn&#x27;t .bashrc run automatically?
How do I set up my shell execution PATH?

What is the difference between .bash_profile and .bashrc?</span>

                    <span>This blogpost is about doing buffered writes to a linux filesystem, and latency fluctuations that it could show you, especially when performing a lot of writes, and other implications.
The first thing to discuss is buffered writes. Any write to a linux local filesystem is done &#x27;buffered&#x27;, unless explicitly defined it not to, which is done by opening the file with the O_DIRECT flag. So all file interactions from the shell likely are done buffered, and the Postgresql database is also using buffered IO.
What happens when you perform a buffered write is that you don&#x27;t actually write to the disk, but instead you write to memory. Because currently the latency of most disk IO/writes is still much higher than memory IO latency (~ 25us/modern SSD vs 160ns/memory, although very configuration specifi…</span>

Can anyone tell me what day of the week Christopher Colombus landed in what is now the Bahamas? A quick Google search will tell you that he arrived on October 12th, 1492. But, it doesn’t mention the day of the week.  The answer happens to be Friday. And, if you make it to the end of this article, I will show you how I used the command line to find out the answer.
In honor of Indigenous People’s Day, I figured I would use a little bit of history to teach you about a topic you’re probably not interested in. The command line interface.
The command line is a powerful tool that can be used to interact with a computer’s operating system. It can access information in a computer’s file system. It can interact with an application’s database.  It can make API calls(e.g. Git). In fac…</span>

                    <span>In the previous post I laid out the scaffolding for my back end code. It took a little time to think through the code I would need. I referred to some past projects and a tutorial I had taken when I was first learning React. During the process of pseudo-coding there were a couple times where I felt like the effort was outweighing the eventual benefits. What’s the point of writing one comment line to describe another single line importing a model after all?
After completing the process, I felt different about that “extra work”. The result was akin to painting by numbers. Once I finished pseudo-coding, it only took a fraction of the time I would normally spend writing up a node API to get all of the pieces in place and functioning properly. I was able to cut and paste some code from older pr…</span>

the common definition says that it is an open industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties 
so lets break it up into a simpler logic to understand its utility and the way it works!
In security processes, authentication validates a user&#x27;s identity, it also grants that user permission to access a resource.
A JWT is composed by :

                    <span>This YouTube music download API integration is done on the client side without a backend (I did not want to deal with backend infrastructure to hide the API key). I used KOR Connect as the middleware platform (free) to quickly and easily integrate the API in a secure way. Firstly I will go over why I chose this route. 
We all know that API keys and connections can not be secured on the client side of an application. Hard coding API keys on the frontend is a quick and surefire way to have your API connection shutdown, API keys stolen, and have your API provider’s bill skyrocket. So what options are there if you do not want to maintain back end infrastructure? I will explore the recommended techniques for integrating 3rd party APIs into client side applications without having to build a back…</span>

                    <span>RxJS is a powerful library for reactive programming. We use it in Angular all the time, from simple reactions to HTTP client responses to full-blown state management solutions. But sometimes, it is easy to miss some details and create a code that can break at the worst possible moment. 
Let’s start with an example right away.
of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  .pipe(
    tap(v &#x3D;&gt; {
      if (v &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 3) {
        throw new Error(&#x27;some error&#x27;);
      }
    })
  )
  .subscribe({
    next: console.log.bind(null, &#x27;next:&#x27;),
    error: (err: Error) &#x3D;&gt; console.log(&#x27;error:&#x27;, err.message),
  });

We have an observable that emits numbers from 1 to 5, and if the number is 3, we throw an error.
We can see the following output.
next: 1
next: 2
error: some error

Numbers 4 and 5 were not processed at all.

                    <span>📣 The world is amazing ,but Not so ideal as we think!🤔
💡 Unix-like operating systems such as Linux do not have an undelete command.
When we delete something with rm , it&#x27;s gone.Linux assumes we&#x27;re smart and we know what we&#x27;re doing.

One of the big problem can cause wildcards. so be particularly with them.
For Example : if we want to delete just the JS files in directory we type:
rm *.js
* and the .js like so:
rm * .js
.js
There is many ways to avoid this problem, here is 2 useful tip: 
-i (interactive) option, which prompt the user for confirmation  ,before deleting an existing file.
rm i *.js
rm: remove regular empty file &#x27;mk.js&#x27;?
2 - whenever we use wildcards with rm, test the wildcard first with ls. This will let we see the files that will be deleted. Then we can press the up arrow ☝️ to recall the command and replace ls with rm.</span>

Caph is the future of data storage whether it was objects, blocks or a file system. It provides a great alternative to self-hosted solutions such as GlusterFS in the realm of file systems and to managed services such as AWS S3 as an object storage where it makes more sense to host your own data because you have to store it on private cloud or simply to reduce costs as S3 costs sometimes grow to be pretty insane.
I used Vagrant to create a declarative configuration of my environment.
My setup consist of three virtual machines with Ubuntu 20.04 and attached disk storage of 10 GiB to each one of them (except the first machine it has two disks). Ceph documentation says the minimum disk size is 5 GiB but I had problems in the past working with storage less than 10 GiB so I wanted…</span>

                    <span>Um dos grandes problemas que enfrentei ao atualizar o frontend de aplicações angular foi o cache. 
Praticamente todos os navegadores mantêm um cache da aplicação no computador do cliente para conseguir carregar a aplicação de forma mais rápida e com menor consumo de dados e isso é excelente. Entretanto, um efeito colateral é que as atualizações podem demorar para serem entregues para o cliente. Como consequência, o cliente pode ficar horas ou dias com uma versão com um bug que já foi corrigido.
Em sistemas internos de empresas, isso pode resultar em ligações ou tickets constantes para a equipe de suporte técnico, causando uma sobrecarga na equipe. Quando estamos falando de aplicações fornecidas para clientes externos à empresa, pode ser um ponto de frustração e insatisfação com o produto.

Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
ngx-spinner is a loading (spinner) component library with more than 50 different types.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the application with the Angular base structure using the @angular/cli with the route file and the SCSS style format.
ng new angular-spinner
? Would you like to add Angular routing? Yes
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? SCSS   [ https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss                ]
