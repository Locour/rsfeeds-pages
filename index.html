                    <span>In this tutorial, I explain one workaround that I did to create one Docker image of one Angular application which has one dynamic API URL.
The article How To Build An Angular App Once And Deploy It To Multiple Environments - Solution 4: Override environment file values explains how you can do this.
But, as I&#x27;m far from a Docker expert, I spent some time to create the Dockerfile to do this :)
Just quoting the article:
The idea is to use Angular’s environment.ts (for local development) and environment.prod.ts (for all other stages) with placeholder values which are overwritten per deployment:
export const environment &#x3D; {
  apiUrl: &#x27;MY_APP_API_URL&#x27;,
  stage: &#x27;MY_APP_STAGE&#x27;,
};

If our pod is started we can then run the following script, for example in a Dockerfile, that overrides these placeholder values:
#!/bin/sh
# replace placeholder value in JS bundle with environment specific values
sed -i &quot;s#MY_APP_API_URL#$API_URL#g&quot; /usr/share/nginx/html/main.*.js

Here is the Dockerfile I created to run this workaround:
FROM nginx:latest

COPY dist/your-app-name /usr/share/nginx/html

CMD [&quot;/bin/bash&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, \
&quot;echo API_URL&#x3D;[$API_URL], &amp;&amp; \
sed -i s#MY_APP_API_URL#$API_URL#g /usr/share/nginx/html/main.*.js &amp;&amp; \
nginx -g &#x27;daemon off;&#x27;&quot;]

Build your project:
$ ng build

Place this Dockerfile into your Angular root folder and run this to build your image:
$ docker build -t angular/your-app-name .

After this, just run your container passing the API_URL variable:
$ docker run -p 80:80 --name your-app-name -e API_URL&#x3D;http://localhost:8080 angular/your-app-name</span>

When you have to log, do it consistently.
Logging is necessary. It allows us to debug in both development and production. But console is disallowed by tslint by default. And for good reason. Console logging is a mess most of the time. If you can just willy-nilly console.log(whatever) then your logs are pretty much useless.
We can end up with too much logging in production, which can slow our application down, and not enough in development where we need more details.
I’ve had to deal with this issue on multiple projects and have written a static logger class in Angular that allows us to control what we log and where.
Here is the gist https://gist.github.com/jkyoutsey/e99336d58c2c83bc0ba03cde78fcc64e
In a nutshell you have the following options:

                    <span>After you&#x27;ve upgraded to Angular v12 from a previous version of Angular, you may notice your ng serve times have increased, along with missing sourcemaps, and longer rebuild times during development. This post helps you set a default configuration to development to get your application serving the same as previously.
In Angular version 12, running ng build now defaults to production mode. This is a welcomed change, as there is less chance of accidentally deploying a development build to production, which is a lot slower and bigger, giving the perception that Angular is slow. This also aligns with other web frameworks that build for production out of the box.
The way Angular serves the application, it essentially does a build with watch mode. As mentioned before, doing a build is now done by default with production optimizations enabled. This adds more time to the build process.
There is a migration to add a &quot;development&quot; build configuration.
To run this migration, run:
ng update @angular/cli --migrate-only production-by-default

One caveat is that it only supports migrating first-party Angular builders for development mode, including:
@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server
@angular-devkit/build-angular:protractor
To fix this manually, you add the development options as defaults, and a defaultConfiguration set to an empty string so it doesn&#x27;t default to production.
Now, when running ng serve you will get a development build, which is faster for local development.

Here&#x27;s what you can accomplish by building notifications:
Drive engagement. Notifications inform customers that there’s something going on in your application that’s worthy of their attention. Timely notifying your audience about valuable content or interactions with other users is great for building trust and engagement.
Enable user journeys based on asynchronous actions. If you don’t expect your users to always be connected to your app or service, notifications enable your users to stay plugged in without having to constantly check for updates in-app.

                    <span>This is a tough for myself since I&#x27;m still learning as I go but what I can recollect from what I read. it restructures a function so it takes one argument, then returns another function that takes the next argument, and so on.


Here&#x27;s an example:




function add(x) {
return function(y) {
  return function(z) {
    return x + y + z;
  }
}

}
console.log(add(10)(20)(30));

The add(10)(20)(30) should return 60.
This is useful in your program if you can&#x27;t supply all the arguments to a function at one time. You can save each function call into a variable, that hold&#x27;s the returned function that takes the next argument when it&#x27;s available.</span>

Example, the following code would check if every element in arr is positive.




function check(arr) {

The some method works with arrays to check if any element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value true if any of the values meet the criteria, false if not.

                    <span>In 2011, every aspect of our lives seemed to be moving to the web. Smartphone and tablet use was rising, and the recent completion of the HTML5 specification, together with nice additions such as the web manifest, seemed to pave a path to a bright future. As the hip social network Facebook bet strongly on HTML5 for their mobile application, everything was shipshape.
Then there were some unfortunate setbacks. First, the up-and-coming native app framework PhoneGap did not go anywhere. Facebook then announced they were rewriting their mobile app. HTML5 was not ready yet, they said.
Finally, as Google announced AMP — a subset of HTML5 with some custom elements — no one wanted to bet on HTML as an app platform. Failed experiments such as webOS and Mozilla’s Firefox OS set the transition back ev…</span>

                    <span>First released in 2013, Vue is a progressive framework for building web user interfaces. It’s an adoptable, not monolithic, framework that integrates with other frameworks such as React and Angular. While Vue is focused only on the view layer, it can power single-page applications (SPAs) with ease. This fully open-source project is maintained on its GitHub page.
September 2020’s full release of Vue 3 had significant improvements for developers. Vue 3 is fully backward compatible with Vue 2. It has improved performance, better readability, and several new features.
Today, we’ll examine a few of those features and see how to use them to enhance your development workflow. We’ll also reflect on some workarounds needed to use these features in previous versions of Vue. We’ll cover TypeScript su…</span>

Quando me pergunto sobre a qualidade de um software, me vem a imagem de uma lista de testes executados e todos verdinhos, já para Willian E. Deming em seu livro Qualidade: revolução da administração afirma que, a qualidade tem muitas escalas, por exemplo, um livro de qualidade é determinado pela legibilidade, papel, tamanho, inexistência de erros, ou seja, o leitor deseja encontrar no livro cultura e entretenimento, enquanto a editora deseja encontrar nele, boa oportunidade de venda. A avaliação do que é qualidade dependeria, portanto, das escalas de valor determinadas por cada entidade.

                    <span>Jamstack apps are easy to develop and have great performance, but there’s a catch — they’re largely pre-rendered and static. However, they don’t have to be! Static apps make sense for the fixed parts of your site, but Jamstack apps are capable of incorporating dynamic, interactive components as well.
In this hands-on tutorial, we’ll explore step-by-step how to add a SpreadJS spreadsheet to a Jamstack app created with Next.js. The Next.js React framework provides server-side pre-rendering out-of-the-box.
Before getting started, ensure you have Node.js installed together with npm. Otherwise, install them using one of these methods:
  Get the right installation binary for your operating system from the official website.

Dev (Development)
Ops (Operations)
Designates the union of people and technology to deliver value to customers on a constant basis.
What DevOps allows is that the roles (development, security, IT operations…) can be coordinated in a simple way to create better products.
This is how benefits are obtained such as:
Create better products
Better meet customer needs
Reach goals in less time
That is why you are going to know the top 10 reasons to learn DevOps
By getting a little familiar with DevOps, you will get the concept of the Software Delivery Lifecycle (SDLC). As a developer, you will know what is happening at all times in testing and in production.

                    <span>Adding a Pantavisor Linux system, middleware or app container from docker is done using our pvr middleware tool.
If you are using Pantavisor Linux with our PVBox frontend you can simply use the pvboxctl &quot;install&quot; command to get this done:

Next you select &quot;Add from docker&quot;

And choose a name:

And finally type the &quot;Docker Source&quot; ref from your preferred docker registry:

And let pvr do the the rest:

Once finished you will have a chance to do some final edits to you app and commit it:
&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;

We have provisioned the following files
for the parts you have selected to edit:


You can now edit part \&#x27;mynewapp\&#x27; and change
them to your liking.

Remember to pvr commit any changes you might
want to apply to your system.

When done, you can:
1. apply committed changes: exit 0 (or Ctrl-D)
2. discard your changes: exit 1

For help visit: https://pantavisor.io

pvctlbox::mynewapp#


Often you can just use the container using the default configuration pantavisor linux generated for you.
Once happy you would run:
pvr add .
pvr commit

and exit the interactive shell (e.g. press ctrl-D) to apply you changes and instruct pantavisor to run the new, modified system that includes your new docker container.</span>

What problems does Docker solve?
What are containers?
What is the difference between a container and a VM?
What is the difference between images and containers?
How does Docker help create applications?
Why Docker?
The need for Docker arises from virtual machines on servers being used at large scales. Take a large business for example. For a business that uses hundreds of servers with a cluster of virtual machines for each of their platforms, maintaining these machines is a full-time job. Each server has to have an OS installed, it needs upgrades and patches from time to time, and then dependencies for the applications each machine uses also have to be installed. 
You can see why this quickly becomes very complex. Manually configuring these servers is not feasible, so …</span>

So, what are events? &quot;Stuff that happens&quot;. Honestly, I&#x27;m not going to get into the technical minutia because there are plenty stack stackoverflow responses and literature out there.

                    <span>I believe the single-biggest barriers to entry for modern Javascript development are the build tools that are necessary to use it effectively. It’s all a black box, breaks with vague error messages, that ultimately lead you down a tunnel of “google and pray”. Unless you’ve spent a lot of time with Webpack, it’s hard to troubleshoot when it inevitably breaks. (and seriously, who freaking has time to learn all the idiosyncrasies of Webpack?)
But even with that, the benefits vastly outpace the drawbacks. When Javascript build tools work, they work beautifully – compiling your scripts down to the smallest size, ensuring that it works on all web browsers, and in the case of WordPress, even automatically enqueuing dependent scripts that are a part of WordPress core.

                    <span>Middlewares play a very important part in the request-response  lifecycle. The middlewares are placed between the Server and the response.
The mail role of middleware is to process the request in the middle before it is received by the Route Handler. The processing could be related to a variety of things such as :
Logging all requests coming to the server (Morgan is a very popular middleware used for this purpose)


To verify if the request has auth token or not (Passcode JS is a popular middleware for this purpose)



These are basically functions that can access request object, response object as well as the next middleware function in the application&#x27;s request-response lifecycle (Next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next).

A module is a JavaScript files that can export one or more values. These values can be variables, objects, or even functions.
JavaScript does not have built-in support for modules, but the community has created impressive work-arounds. The two most important standards are:
CommonJs Modules - What we know as the require() method for importing modules and module.exports for exporting. This is designed for synchronous loading and mainly used for server.


Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) - The most popular implementation of this standard is RequireJS. This is designed for asynchronous loading and mainly used for browsers.

                    <span>At Mastering JS, we typically recommend using for/of loops to iterate through an array in JavaScript. However, forEach() is still very common, and it is sometimes more convenient for one-liners.

Here&#x27;s some of our best tutorials for JavaScript forEach():
1) Iterating Through an Object with forEach()
JavaScript arrays have a forEach() function, but general objects do not. This tutorial explains 3 ways to iterate through an object using forEach(): using Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries().
2) How to Break Out of a JavaScript forEach() Loop
You can&#x27;t use the break statement with forEach(), because forEach() is a function, not a loop. If you want to break out of a forEach() loop, the easiest way is to use .every() instead of .forEach(). This tutorial presents 3 ways to simulate break in a forEach().
3) Get The Current Array Index in JavaScript forEach()
The forEach() function calls your callback with 3 parameters. Most forEach() loops only use the first parameter, the value. The 2nd parameter is the current array index. This tutorial shows you how to get the array index.
4) Using Continue in JavaScript forEach()
Because forEach() is a function, not a loop, you can&#x27;t use continue. However, with forEach(), return behaves like continue. This tutorial presents 2 alternatives for simulating continue with forEach().
5) How to Use forEach in an Async Function
The forEach() function doesn&#x27;t work well with async await. This is one of the major reasons why we recommend for/of over forEach(). This tutorial presents 2 alternative patterns that simulate async forEach().</span>

                    <span>Functional programming is a programming paradigm that is focused on composing functions together to execute a particular programming task. Many programming languages available today supports functional programming style. Most people would argue that they rather do things the Object Oriented way but i tell you, there is nothing wrong in using a functional programming approach to writing your code. Due to the support we get with most languages we can pass functions as arguments to to other functions, we can also return a function from another function. So the basic idea about using a functional programming approach is to isolate different processes in our code in to reusable functions. Since functional programming is concerned so much with functions, we will look at what functions are and th…</span>

                    <span>I ❤️ building things and, when it comes to software, I’ve done that for quite a few platforms and in various programming languages over the years. Recently I’ve been developing a desktop app built with Electron and I must say the whole first-timer experience has been rather pleasing. One thing that required “a bit” of attention was the build process for different platforms (Windows, macOS) and part of it was the app notarization step on macOS. What on paper looked like a really easy thing to do, took me a couple of hours and a lot of detective work to get it right 🕵️‍♀️.

                    <span>The regularity of media reports on cyberattacks shows that security is, or should be, a key issue for software development teams these days. Experience also shows that security vulnerabilities are usually not created by highly specialized functions. Rather, many successful attacks exploit well-known security vulnerabilities. For this reason, we are very pleased that the learning platform Secure Code Warrior is now integrated into our version management tool SCM-Manager.
An example of well-known security vulnerabilities is SQL injections, where arbitrary code is injected into database queries, allowing unauthorized information to be read (for more on this, see the Wikipedia article). Such attacks are very popular because they can be carried out very easily. That’s why SQL injections have co…</span>

Introduction


Hello. Welcome to this week&#x27;s security review. As usual, I am your host Habdul Hazeez.

Anonymization or pseudonymization are some of the technics commonly adopted to do protect some data. In both case, you want to remove the ability to identify someone and more important the link to his personal information (financial, health, preferences…), while keeping the data practically useful. Anonymization consists in removing any direct (and part of indirect) identifying data. Pseudonymization does not remove these information but modify them so that we cannot m…</span>

YARA is a tool used to help researchers to identify and classify malware. YARA is a multi-platform that supports both Unix and Windows based systems, and it can be used via command line or from python scripts with the yara-python extension. 
Running YARA
To run YARA via command line, run the following the command:

                    <span>VoIP, Voice over Internet protocol, is the future of business communications. Thanks to its versatility, flexibility, and affordability, it is becoming an important part of the business telephony system. VoIP telephony is a clearer, faster, and more comprehensive communication medium for industries of all sizes to run business over the phone, but is it secure?
Considering the rising number of cybercrime around the world, the importance of security has become paramount. Phishing attacks, scam calls, malware, and other unknown security threats have put the business in disastrous situations.
Industries are losing their confidential information and money at alarming rates due to the loopholes, which can be closed with security alternatives.

                    <span>Welcome to the second vue academy ! It will be a list of lot of article on vue! I have 2.5 years of experience in this and I can teach a few thing about this !
For this course we will focus on v-model directive !
First problematic, how do we manage an input value in  ?
We could do the next :

export default {
  name: &quot;HelloWorld&quot;,
  data: function () {
    return {
      message: &#x27;&#x27;,
    }
  },
  methods: {
     updateMessage(event) {
         this.message &#x3D; event.target.value
     }
  },
};




    



We need to bind value of input to our current data message and handle event from this input in order to update our current data message.
It&#x27;s not really friendly and we have to do this for every  component...
You can use the v-model directive to create two-way data bindings on form input, textarea, and select elements. It automatically picks the correct way to update the element based on the input type.
So we can replace the code above by

export default {
  name: &quot;HelloWorld&quot;,
  data: function () {
    return {
      message: &#x27;&#x27;,
    }
  },
};




    



We can remove the method that update value ! Since v-model will directly update it.
It&#x27;s very useful !</span>

                    <span>Very often when working on full stack solutions we find ourselves opening 4+ tabs in our terminal. We would run a yarn dev for on micro-service then a yarn start for react and so on.
This has always been annoying to handle and so we built Child Manager which lets you manager child processes for your project from just a simple config file.
https://github.com/pixiumdigital/child-manager/
To install run the following commands:
yarn add @pixium-digital/child-manager

You can also use NPM
npm install @pixium-digital/child-manager

To leverage child manager simply add a configuration file to your project (see below for config details)
You can run thew following command:
yarn child-manager

By default the loaded config will be at the source of the project and be named childmanager.json

Composition is very powerful in React but for some cases, it may be hard to use.
Today I will give you examples of composition caught up in real Typescript projects.
Take a very common component, like a button. We have a lot of them in our apps.
Below, a generic component, a button with some props.

                    <span>Functional programming is a programming paradigm that is focused on composing functions together to execute a particular programming task. Many programming languages available today supports functional programming style. Most people would argue that they rather do things the Object Oriented way but i tell you, there is nothing wrong in using a functional programming approach to writing your code. Due to the support we get with most languages we can pass functions as arguments to to other functions, we can also return a function from another function. So the basic idea about using a functional programming approach is to isolate different processes in our code in to reusable functions. Since functional programming is concerned so much with functions, we will look at what functions are and th…</span>

WebApp link: https://helpinghand.sowmenrahman.tech
HelpingHand is an open source app that was built to serve exactly one purpose: 
To help people who are in need of it. Every app user signs up on the app platform and then can find themselves open to helping people from various posts that the people have earlier made. This person can then reach out to these people if they feel that the post describes a problem that he/she/they can solve.
But there&#x27;s a catch, if you&#x27;re reaching out to a person you&#x27;ve never interacted before, both of your identities are kept secret, unless the post shares finds you…</span>

Component store for state management
Rx-angular template for RxLet and push pipe
Rest we will add stuff as needed and think about it in various scenario&#x27;s as we go. I&#x27;ll add stuff to github repo on Thursday and drop an article on what we did on Friday. Follow along if you want to learn more about Angular.
Github Repo - https://github.com/ajitsinghkaler/devto-clone
Deployed on Firebase - https://dev-toclone.firebaseapp.com/
Right now we have created the header component and next we will create the side bar.

Each commit message will tell what we have done in that commit. Follow alone if you want to learn angular and let me know if any enhancements you think are needed create an issue on the repo if you want we can discuss there.</span>

Nesse post vou mostrar como implantar um aplicativo angular no azure pelo github-actions.
Windows Terminal
NodeJs
Angular - CLI
Azure - CLI
GitHub - CLI
e também uma assinatura no Azure
Você pode criar uma conta no azure e consumir os créditos para teste, mas nesse artigo os recursos que irei consumir são gratuítos.
O Coaltime, aplicação fictícia que apresentei no artigo anterior, recebeu permissão para ser continuado e agora precisamos de mais agilidade de implantação devido a contínuas mudanças no código. Outra coisa é que decidimos implantar o aplicativo em um serviço Linux.
Faça download do Coaltime (não clone)

                    <span>💫 The &quot;magic glue&quot; that connects the view and the model, keeping them both in sync.
Angular Change Detection is one of the most complex topics in software engineering and obviously in Angular as it is relying on that a lot. It can definitely be compared to the &quot;magic glue&quot; that connects the view and the model, keeping them both in sync&quot;.
On a broader scale, it is a mechanism built into Angular that allows Angular to decide what actions can be performed when the state of the app changes. The good news is that most of the time, developers do not have to deal with change detection manually.
However, if you find yourself caught in a loop, the only way to simplify your journey is to follow specific strategies, for example OnPush and trigger change detection manually if you need to. 
There are four ways you can trigger change detection manually. Let’s look at them in detail:
tick() on ApplicationRef **that activates change detection for the entire application by staying consistent and respectful to the strategy component of the change detection.
detectChanges() on ChangeDetectorRef  runs change detection on a current component.
markForCheck() on ChangeDetectorRef controls change detection through the marked components where the OnPush strategy has been set.
run() on NgZone that allows you to execute a function inside the Angular zone. This function, and all asynchronous operations in that function, trigger change detection automatically at the correct time.
Here is a very handy tip, which can simplify your life.

                    <span>Abstract thinking facilities us in solving many problems and solving them efficiently. Ability to say A is like B, helps us cheaply export solutions developed in A to solve B. This further refines the abstract pattern and makes it more robust and reusable (evolution!).
To solve problems in astronomy ancient Greeks developed abstract patterns to study geometry of triangles, Trigonometry. Now trigonometry helps us in solving problems ranging from construction of buildings to measuring current in electrical circuits.
Abstraction in Programming:
One of the primary objectives of programming is to come up with a code to mimic a real world process as precisely as possible. More precision results in bug free code which preforms adequately in most of the circumstances encountered in the process.

Over a year ago i released the ScoutX project. It is comprised of:
A Flask application where users can input their Nightscout entries endpoint. This app is constantly listening for values and when these are above or below range it fires and alert and calls the diabetic patient first, to alert them of irregular values. Should the patient not answer the call, an alert is sent to their trusted contacts to notify of irregular values.

                    <span>I am an angular collaborator and an avid user of Angular this is my first react project a netflix clone using react, styled components, jest tests. It uses firebase firestore as the DB if you want to run it you have to set it up using the seed data already given. To setup follow the instruction in readme and firebase.prod.js. You can also fork my repo or set it upto learn more.
Creating a component in React.js is a dream components cannot be created easier than this.


Hooks for state management - Hooks are a really easy paradigm for state management 




  
  
  Neutral experiences



Styled components - Suffers from scalability problems writing styles again and again seemed weird but the scoping was great.
Context was weird Calling use context again and again seemed odd somehow. Maybe I&#x27;m not accustomed to it.


How to find right tools for the job you are trying to do. React has so many options which is great but it makes choosing the right tool that much harder.


How to scale react could not find good resources on it. 




  
  
  Angular apparent short comings after using React




State Management- It has nothing compared to hooks


Component creation is so hard in Angular


Why do we need modules. Why?


Angular team giving every package has taken its toll on angular innovation. Not much is tried by the community in angular.




  
  
  Angular strong suit




Angular basics will always be same because of the same lib use so easy to work on multiple projects


Angular directives there is nothing like them 


Angular schematics setting up libs for you is great


Angular Cli is the best




  
  
  CSS Management


I don&#x27;t know how we got to this place in frontend but there is no great way in Angular or react to manage your CSS is important in frontend but not much attention or tooling is there for managing it
Let me know in the comments if I&#x27;m wrong about something or I need to study more I&#x27;m trying to learn other frameworks so that I know more paradigms in frontend development.</span>

RAID 0 disk arrays are known for relatively high data access time, and that’s why people choose to use them primarily because of the considerable boost in the speed of read and write operations. However, their reliability and fault-tolerance leave much to be desired. Even if one of the drives is out of order, all the data in such a disk array is going to be lost. Recovering the information from this array type is quite a challenge, but even then, all the data you may be able to extract will certainly be damaged. In fact, this type is not much of a disk array because it offers no redundancy at al…</span>

                    <span>Cryptography is the backbone of distributed ledger technologies like blockchain and other consensus-oriented distributed networks. If you are interested in building decentralized applications, it&#x27;s essential to understand the wallet generation and transaction signing processes. Both of which rely heavily on underlying cryptographic protocols.
In addition to distributed networks, cryptography is a critical component of cybersecurity. With cybercrime on the rise and cyberattacks costing businesses an average of 2.3 Million dollars per malware attack source, it is increasingly important to have your cybersecurity up to par. With the proper use of cryptography, you could save your business big time by ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive information.

We write unnecessary code.
What we think the code will do is wrong.
Not everything is testable.
Not everyone will understand the code you write.
Code is not always extendible nor manageable.
The Software you build for a company will never be for the greater good.
You are being exploited, and your job exists because others get exploited.
You will never know everything there is about Software.
Technology moves in the direction of money, not progress.
Software will never keep up with real life.
AI will neither save us nor destroy us.
Things change around you; you don’t change things directly.
You don’t need everything in your tech stack.
Your architecture is unnecessarily complicated.
Your documentation is not good.
Every computer system is compromised.

                    <span>Password managers are becoming more common these days as we are using an increasing number of sites each day. I have used several password managers for about 4 years, but I&#x27;ve never found the one that fits me. Everyone had some major flaws like it felt outdated or it was too expensive. Then it hit me... why shouldn&#x27;t I create the next Facebook of password storage?
1. The app must have a generous free tier. I wanted a personal plan, where you can store your passwords safely across multiple devices without hassle.
2. The app must feel new and responsive. When I used Lastpass and Bitwarden I felt like I was using a slightly outdated piece of software. I think the best and easiest way to achieve this is by

                    <span>Topological sort is an ordering of the vertices of a directed acyclic graph, in a way that if there is an edge from a vertex A to B, then A comes before B. For example, let&#x27;s say there is a set of projects and some of them depend on other projects:

In this example project B and C depends on project A, and project D depends on projects B and C. Therefore, project A must be executed first, then projects B and C, and finally project D. Resulting in this order: [A, B, C, D] or [A, C, B, D].
Note that we start from node A because it doesn&#x27;t have dependencies and repeat it, that is after A is done, B and C haven&#x27;t dependencies anymore, so we can choose either one to be the next. That&#x27;s why this algorithm works only on acyclic graphs.
We can use a modified depth-first search for this algorithm, …</span>

                    <span>Hi I&#x27;m Waylon


I am currently a Masters&#x27;s candidate studying computer science at Colorado State University. After I completed my bachelor&#x27;s degree in Mathematics and Philosophy, I was employed as a cybersecurity intern by the academic computing and networking services at CSU. I quickly developed a deep passion for cybersecurity and computer science and decide to go back to school to learn more.
While studying for my master&#x27;s, I have been employed as a Junior Systems Administrator for the Computer Science department, managing over 600 Unix machines. This summer I am also working for Hedera Hashgraph as a developer advocate intern providing educational content on how to leverage the Hashgraph distributed network.
I love python, Linux, rust, and cryptography. If you share any of these interests, don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out. I look forward to sharing my technical experiences with all of you hear and learn from the community. Thanks for reading :)</span>

                    <span>O Manjaro é uma distro Linux baseada no Arch, mas que trás uma instalação muito mais facilitada do que seu irmão maior, a instalação foi feita no Manjaro Gnome, mas os comandos via terminal são todos iguais em qualquer uma das várias interfaces disponíveis para o Manjaro.
A escolha pelo Manjaro ao invés de uma distro mais popular se dá para mim principalmente pela presença do gerenciador de pacotes do Arch, o Pacman, e a possibilidade de acessar o enorme repositório do Arch, considerando o AUR e também a possibilidade de adicionar facilmente o suporte a Flatpack e Snap diretamente no gerenciador de pacotes Pamac, que possui uma GUI, basicamente se existe algo para Linux, então estará disponível para o Manjaro de forma facilitada por meio de algum dos repositórios citados, oficiais ou não. …</span>

                    <span>Answer is : ####Slim
This results in a real VM that can boot instantly, while using very limited resources. If done properly, slim can allow you to design and build immutable unikernels for running services, or build tiny and embedded development environments.
Slim currently supports Virtualbox, KVM, and hyperkit (MacOS only) as providers for running VMs. Slim will discover all available providers, defaulting to virtualbox, if more than one provider is available. The -p flag can be used to force Slim to use a specific provider.
You can find repo here
 / 
        slim
      
    
 

slim will build a micro-vm from a Dockerfile. Slim works by building and extracting a rootfs from a Dockerfile, and then merging that filesystem with a small minimal kernel that runs in RAM.
This results in a real VM that can boot instantly, while using very limited resources. If done properly, slim can allow you to design and build immutable unikernels for running services, or build tiny and embedded development environments.
Create a micro-vm from a Dockerfile. Use build command with a directory containing a Dockerfile.
$ slim build images/alpine3.8-simple



This will add a bootable iso in the slim registry. See example Dockerfile.
slim build will use your default provider unless the -p flag is specified (ie -p hyperkit).
See a list of micro-vm images on your machine.
$ slim images

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>
