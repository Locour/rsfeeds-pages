                    <span>Monoliths have their place in many systems. Usually they stem from ease of use, allowing cross cutting changes to be done in a single pull request. They also have a lot of downsides, but that’s a whole other can of worms.
Here are the main points we had trouble with in our monolith:
How do you share code between sub-projects?
How do you manage typescript compilation for dependant projects? E.g. if a depends on b and I make a change to a, I want b to be compiled as well with the latest version of a.
This was an example of my repository structure:
projectA/
projectB/
projectC/
packages/

Inside my packages/ directory I had some core shared libraries, like types / shared utils etc.
Ok — so how do you get it all to work together?
Since we were already using yarn, it seemed like yarn workspaces…</span>

UI blocking is a thing of the past!


https://angularprojects.com


If you are building an application where you do a lot of calculations on UI, such as creating CAD documents, doing heavy geometrical calculations, or heavy data table manipulations, then you might have observed that the UI sometimes becomes laggy or janky.
This happens because JavaScript is not the only thing that runs on the main thread, but other things like the painting of pixels, style calculations, and many others also run on it. When we run heavy long-running JavaScript on the browser, occasionally we see that frames are missed, which does not provide a great User Experience.
We have heard that Web Workers is one of the promising solutions to such a problem, but we never knew t…</span>

                    <span>Hello Developers! All we are using either Axios OR fetch to communicate/exchange data with server. Both works perfect as per your requirement. Today we will go in detail and see how they are differ in terms of features they provide.
Axios — has url in request object
axios
  .get(url, {
    headers: {
      &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;,
    },
    timeout: 1000 * 60,
  })
  .then(res &#x3D;&gt; {

  })
  .catch(err &#x3D;&gt; {

  })

Fetch — has no url in request object.
 fetch(url)
  .then((response) &#x3D;&gt; response.json())
  .then((json) &#x3D;&gt; {  

  })
  .catch(() &#x3D;&gt; {

  })

Axios — third-party package that you need to install manually. 85.3k Star in Github — Well managed &amp; rich features library.
npm i axios
Fetch — is in-build into most of the browser, no more need of installation.
Axios — having in-b…</span>

                    <span>Deploying a Kubernetes cluster is a time consuming and boring job so I created a project for solving this issue.
Here is the project: https://github.com/ridvanaltun/kubernetes-vagrant
Just follow the below steps:
# Install the plugin for Vagrant to ability to use environment files.
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-env

# Clone the project.
$ git clone https://github.com/ridvanaltun/kubernetes-vagrant.git 

# Go into it.
$ cd kubernetes-vagrant

# Don&#x27;t forget to customize your own environment file.
$ cp .env.example .env

# Up one master and two worker node.
# This takes approximately ~15 minutes if you using first time.
$ vagrant up m n1 n2

# Connect to master node over SSH.
$ vagrant ssh m

# You can do everything you want, an example, list nodes.
$ kubectl get nodes

It is simple like that.</span>

                    <span>Companies all over the world are realizing that to look professional to their users they need to take control of how they communicate system incidents or maintenance updates.
The best way of course to do this is through a beautifully presented status page.
But you probably knew that already anyway, that’s why you’re now looking for examples of outstanding status pages (some of our own humble examples) to help inspire you or to get a better understanding of what they are and how they work.
Here at Statuspal a hosted status page allows our clients to communicate to their users (employees and customers) up-to-date information about a site&#x27;s status. This can be especially handy when you have a service disruption and you might not have other means to communicate what is going on.

Self-hosted runners are ideal for use-cases where you need to run workflows in a highly customizable environment with more granular control over hardware requirements, security, operating system, and software tools than GitHub-hosted runners provides.
Self-hosted runners can be physical, virtual, in a container, on-premises, or in a cloud. In this guide, we’ll deploy it as a container in the Kubernetes cluster in the AWS cloud.

Opentelemetry logs are painful as fuck. Nothing official in terms of documentation :) I swear to god I feel I will find a good implementation and I will DOCUMENT IT FFS.
The other night I jotted down a blogpost for traces + opentelemetry + sentry. I hope folks would love it. Golang, Opentelemetry, and Sentry — The Underrated Distributed Tracing Stack

Also, fluentd ---&gt; OTEL Collector integration? YOU ARE PAINFUL :) Idk what kubernetes service guide I need to revisit because I am sure af not getting anywhere in this respect.
Get done with one more exam.
Setup the log system locally and see if it works.
Upload the rules files.
Go through the exporter fix PR in the weekend maybe. Or if time allows tomorrow.
Thanks for listening to the rant.

Please note that this is an on-going exercises. I&#x27;ll be updating this once I&#x27;m done with the labs, probably on Saturday (26-Jun-2021). Stay tune! 😄
This section will contain multiple labs:
Lab 1 - Deploying a Kubernetes Cluster using k3s
Lab 2 - Deploying a Kubernetes Cluster using kind
Lab 3 - Deploying an Application using Kubernetes Resources
Lab 4 - Access an Application using Kubernetes Resource
Lab 5 - Creating Configmaps and Secrets
Lab 6 - Creating a Namespace within a Kubernetes Cluster
Lab 7 - Deploying Resources using kubectl
Lab 8 - Deploying Resources through a Declarative Approach
Edge Case: Failing Control Plane for Kubernetes
The objective of this lab is to create the following resources:
a namespace
name: demo
label: tier: test
a deployment:
image: nginx:alpine
name:nginx-apline
namespace: demo
replicas: 3
labels: app: nginx, tag: alpine
a service:
expose the above deployment on port 8111
namespace: demo
a configmap:
name: nginx-version
containing key-value pair: version&#x3D;alpine
namespace: demo
Note: Nginx is one of the public Docker images, that you can access and use for your exercises or testing purposes.

                    <span>APIs – by now, we’re all familiar with the term. Every service or software we use or build today either uses or is an API. If APIs are a central pillar in your building and delivery of software and services, you’ll know that the success of your software or services depends on the integrity, availability, and performance of your APIs. Traditional API monitoring sure does help you stay on top of uptime, security, and performance. Still, it is limited to being a black box form of monitoring – you’re only testing API behavior that you’d only see externally. You’d still have to guess what’s causing issues with your APIs as you’re only testing, measuring, and monitoring them against metrics you already know – like request rates, error rates, or status codes.

There are two ways we can follow in deploying Kubernetes clusters. The first one is what we&#x27;ve been doing so far, the imperative approach.
The imperative approach allows managing resources using kubectl commands directly on the live cluster.  This technique is best suited for development stages only, as it presents a low entry-level bar to interact with the cluster.
The declarative approach uses manifests that is stored locally to create and manage Kubertenest objects. This approach is recommended for production releases, as we …</span>

                    <span>Today we will be looking at how we can make use of commands and args in Docker to run our own processes when we spin up containers. This could be useful if you want to run one-off tasks without having to create your own images.
Let’s imagine that we want run a bash command. What’s the easiest way to do this? Just by spinning up a container using a lightweight image like busybox, ubuntu, debian? For instance, let’s say we use Debian as our base image.
docker run debian echo hello

We will get back “hello”, which is expected. What would happen if we check if the container is running?

The container has stopped running. Containers are not meant to host an operating system compared to a VM. When you run a basic container like Debian or Ubuntu, it will exit once you perform a docker run debian

You can use cloud storage for on-premises data backups to reduce infrastructure and administration costs. There is several ways to backup your on-premise infrastructure to cloud, here I’ll use hybrid cloud (part of your infrastructure is on the cloud and part of your infrastructure is on the on-premise) to accomplish it. In this post I’ll show AWS Storage Gateway solutions to bridge between on-premise data to cloud. The common use case is disaster recovery, backup &amp; restore and tiered storage.
There is 3 types of Storage Gateway:

Before show how I implemented it, I’ll show a brief overview about each one.
Databases and applications are often backed up directly to a file server on-premises. You can now simply point these backups to the File Gateway, which copies the data to …</span>

                    <span>SCP comes in handy to copy files to a remote server from a computer or vice versa. You can also copy server files to another server.
All you need is your server’s IP address and user credentials to start copying. Here are some common SCP commands use cases.
scp file.zip user@hostip:/home/directory

This command will copy file.zip in your terminals present working directory to the home directory of the server.
scp user@hostip:/home/directory/file.zip ~/Downloads

You are copying file.zip from the server’s home directory to your local downloads folder.
Another use case of the SCP command is during site migration to a new server. Zip your site’s root directory and copy it to the new server.
Provide login credentials and file paths of both servers to SCP in your computer’s terminal.
scp user@remotehost1:/home/file.zip user@remotehost2:/home

Add -p flag to add port of remote host
scp -p 1122 file.zip user@hostip:/home/directory

Add a -C flag to enable the gzip compression in SSH transfer
scp -C localfile.zip user@hostip:/home/directory

-v Verbose SCP operation
-p 
 Mention remote host port
-P Save the file’s modification and access times
-r Copy recursively
-c  Specify the cipher for data encryption
So if you are still using an FTP client, use the SCP command in the terminal for a secure transfer.</span>

                    <span>Developers are always looking for simpler ways to do more advanced things in less time, and one of the many ways that they can achieve this is by using a selection of tools to supplement their workflow. The aim of this article is to cover some of the major tools that people use, and to give you an insight into what they can do to make your life easier.
And to seal the deal, all the tools I’ll be mentioning are completely free to use, which is an incredible price for what you’re getting from them.
Git / Version Control
Git is the most well-known version control tool out there. It allows you to store your code on a server (thereby reducing data-loss risks), collaborate with other developers and share your code online. Another huge plus to Git is that it allows you to go and look at other people’s public repositories, and see how they solved certain problems. This can then help you solve the problem in your application, and it can save you lots of time and effort.
Git is open-source itself and it comes with a huge selection of extensions that allow you to modify the functionality of the system in a huge range of different ways.
The fact that Git allows you to go back and review previous versions of your code, see how it’s changed and keep track of issues as well as provide you with lots of automation tools makes it quite clear that Git, or a Git alternative is a must-have for nearly every project.
Whilst you could install a system like Gitea on a VPS and then run your own Git server, there is a selection of different services out there that provide Git repository hosting as a service. These services often come with lots of extras too, and usually a very generous free tier. The most notable Git host out there is definitely GitHub, but it is closely rivalled by GitLab among other solutions.

Hello 👋, Beautiful Coders on the internet 😃. In this article, I would share with you a quick yet comprehensive overview of how the most popular and widely used programming language in the world evolved to be what it is today.
Over the years JavaScript has become the most popular and versatile programming language. Powering over 97% of the web. As a web developer knowing the history of the most popular and in-demand programming language is a plus that will help enhance your understanding of the language.
Back in May 1995, the internet was becoming popular. The web back then was just static pages that were often text-heavy and ugly 😌.
the best ones had images floated to the left or right. Not exciting when you compare it to the web today 🤔

You&#x27;re already storing structured data in the database, it seems only logical to store files in there as well.
So you look up how to save files in MongoDB (or PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.), only to find out that storing files in the database is considered bad practice.
Other web developers are saying that you shouldn&#x27;t store files in the database, and they&#x27;ll frown upon you if you ask them how to.
But nobody tells you why...
Is it because it looks bad to have a very long base64 string in the database?
There has to be more to it than that.
By the end of this article, you&#x27;ll find out why saving files in the database is considered a bad practice.

                    <span>On April 20, 2021, OpenJS released the latest major version of Node.js, Node 16.
With this even-numbered release, we see a few changes to the V8 engine, support for the new Apple Silicon processors, and a stable Timers/Promises API. We can also expect to see long-term support for this version.
As an even-numbered release, we can expect to see Node 16 move to long-term support status, which guarantees that critical bugs will be fixed for a total of 30 months. Also, because Node 16 is an even-numbered release, Node 15 has officially become unsupported.
ONe of the quirks of Node worth remembering is that odd-numbered releases – those literally ending in an odd number -- will go End-of-Life as soon as the next Semantic Version release line ships. According to NodeSource, a blog covering all th…</span>

                    <span>I feel lucky to live in an era where we have so many alternatives to do the same thing. A lot of people criticize this, but I think it&#x27;s amazing to have libraries that do the same thing but with different approaches. I think this helps the programmer to implement a project with something that follows his reasoning.
But today this is not going to be the subject of the article. Today I am going to teach you how to make a validation system using Yup together with Express.js.
In the past I had written an article about how to do exactly the same thing we are going to do today, except using Joi, if you want to read the article click here.
If you&#x27;ve used Joi in the past you&#x27;ll feel comfortable using Yup, both libraries are quite similar.
However I find Yup more intuitive, with a cleaner Api and a…</span>

                    <span>How to install Node, Yarn, Git and VSCode on Linux, Mac and Windows



  
  
  On Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS):



  
  
  Node


Download the Node LTS archive file from https://nodejs.org/ and extract it (in this example, the archive is extracted is /home/user/Downloads/)
Open .bashrc in the home folder (/home/user./bashrc) with a text editor, and append:
PATH&#x3D;$PATH:/home/user/Downloads/node-v14.17.0-linux-x64/bin
Then, in a terminal:
source .bashrc

node -v
# v14.17.0

npm -v
# 6.14.13

You may also need the development tools to build native addons:
sudo apt install gcc g++ make

Alternatively, you can install Node from a package. To install the LTS version, go to https://github.com/nodesource/distributions and
# You need to install curl if it&#x27;s not already installed
sudo apt install curl

                    <span>🧠 Common cognitive biases may be impacting your MFA adoption rates; here are some ways to counter those impacts.



  
  
  
Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) has been shown capable of blocking up to 99.9% of brute force attacks. Yet a recent IBM/Ponemon Institute study found that only 36% of responding organizations require it. And adoption numbers for the general public aren’t encouraging either, with a report from LastPass finding that only 37% of respondents use MFA for their work accounts. When you add the finding by Verizon that 80% of data breaches involves the use of stolen credentials, these numbers beg the question, why?
If MFA has been proven so effective as a defense against data theft and brute force attacks, why are adoption numbers still so low? A common set of issues revol…</span>

Benefits of AWS Security Hub:
Security Hub reduces the effort to collect and prioritize security findings across accounts from integrated AWS services and AWS partner products.

Security Hub processes finding data using a standard finding format, which eliminates the need to manage findings data from multiple formats.

Security Hub then correlates findings across providers to prioritize the most important ones.

Automatic security checks against best practices and standards
Security Hub automatically runs continuous, account-level configuration and security checks based on AWS best practices and industry standards.

Security Hub provides the result of these checks as a readiness score, and identifies specific accounts and resources that require attention.

  First impression


I didn&#x27;t have a good first impression about Relay when I&#x27;ve started using it. I found it difficult to understand, verbose to use, and I didn&#x27;t saw the benefits from it.
Even though I didn&#x27;t like it, I was part of a team, and as a team we choose to stick with Relay and see in the long term if it was a good choice or not.
As the time goes by, I&#x27;ve started to get along with it and to understand how to use it. I still didn&#x27;t have the full idea, but just to realize how I could use it to solve simple problems like data fetching, and to know what I was doing was enough for me at the time.
Months later, I was promoted to tech lead and with that came the responsibility to understand and to explain to my team why we&#x27;re using the stuff that we&#x27;re using. I ha…</span>

                    <span>Imagine you have a list (or a table) with checkboxes, for example, to do list, mail inbox, or “back-office” page. Checkboxes are used to select items for batch actions, for example, delete or archive, etc.
Code can look like this:
const { selected, change } &#x3D; useSelected([] as Array);

return (
  
 (
      
 change(event.target.checked, [item])}

                    <span>In this article, You can find some type validation techniques.
Let&#x27;s start with simple function
Assume, our function argument should be always some CSS value. For example: 100px, 10rem, 50% etc ...
First of all we should check if value ends with some allowed measure units:
type Units &#x3D; &#x27;px&#x27; | &#x27;rem&#x27; | &#x27;%&#x27;;

Now, we should be able to split our measure units into two parts: number and unit

type Units &#x3D; &#x27;px&#x27; | &#x27;rem&#x27; | &#x27;%&#x27;;

type IsValidCSS &#x3D; T extends &#x60;${number}${Units}&#x60; ? true : false;

type Result &#x3D; IsValidCSS // true
type Result2 &#x3D; IsValidCSS // false

Lets write generic validator:
type Units &#x3D; &#x27;px&#x27; | &#x27;rem&#x27; | &#x27;%&#x27;;

type IsValidCSS &#x3D; T extends &#x60;${number}${Units}&#x60; ? true : false;

type Validator &#x3D; T extends true ? [] : [ne…</span>

                    <span>Let&#x27;s write some crazy, unreadable and unmaintainable typings for compose function. Maybe you will learn smth new.
Let&#x27;s define some base types and utils.
type Fn &#x3D; (a: any) &#x3D;&gt; any

type Head &#x3D;
    T extends [infer H, ...infer _]
    ? H
    : never;

type Last &#x3D;
    T extends [infer _]
    ? never : T extends [...infer _, infer Tl]
    ? Tl
    : never;

type Foo &#x3D; typeof foo
type Bar &#x3D; typeof bar
type Baz &#x3D; typeof baz

Our main goal is to make compose without any arguments length restriction.
For example, take a look on lodash compose typings:

    interface LodashFlowRight {
        (f7: (a: R6) &#x3D;&gt; R7, f6: (a: R5) &#x3D;&gt; R6, f5: (a: R4) &#x3D;&gt; R5, f4: (a: R3) &#x3D;&gt; R4, f3: (a: R2) &#x3D;&gt; R3, f2: (a: R1) &#x3D;&gt; R2, f1: (...args:…</span>

                    <span>In this article I will try to implement something similar to lodash.get function.
This is what I want to implement:
// John
const result &#x3D; deepPick({ user: { name: &#x27;John&#x27; } }, &#x27;user&#x27;, &#x27;name&#x27;) 

First of all, we should validate all arguments but first, because they should be in right order. Let&#x27;s assume we have next object:
type Foo &#x3D; {
    user: {
        description: {
            name: string;
            surname: string;
        }
    }
}

Now, we need to generate array of all allowed keys.In order to do that, we need to iterate through every key and replace type property with array of keys.
Does it make sense for You?
type FirstAttempt &#x3D; {
    [P in keyof T]: [P]
}

Above code does not make any sense. We need to iterate through every nested property, hence, we need to make it recurs…</span>

It is very easy to create booking section by wrapping 3 form fields inside a Flex component.

                    <span>Typescript, a superset of JavaScript that gives developers god like control over their code, today we are going to be talking about one of the coolest features in TypeScript; Decorators. You might wonder what they hell are decorators and what they do? Decorators are an experimental feature of typescript and still remain subject to change. That being said, decorators are simply just a way to extend your class with meta data or annotate your code. Why on earth would you want to add some extra data of your own to your data? Well for sorting and grouping purposes. Decorators also allows us to achieve Behaviour Driven code. I think decorators are really cool, in most use cases for creating a decorator you will agree with me that it makes your life much easier to deal with and things are managed…</span>

                    <span>TypeScript has been around for a while, in many new projects it started to be a standard, even old projects slowly migrate into TS. That is really good, good until we use it with common sense. In this article I will show how we can create a problem by doing things in contrast to the type system.
We have following types in our codebase
type Movie &#x3D; {
  uuid: string,
  title: string,
  comments: Comment[]
}
type Comment &#x3D; {
  uuid: string,
  content: string,
}

Now these types are used by some function which is responsible for showing comments. In our example this function will be React component
const Comments &#x3D; (movie: Movie) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (movie?.comments?.length &gt; 0) {
    return movie.comments.map(comment &#x3D;&gt;
      
comment?.content
)
  } else {
    return &quot;No comments&quot;
  }
}

Design Patterns are best software practices used by Software Developers in solving recuring problems in Software Development. They aren&#x27;t code-related but rather a blueprint to use in designing a solution for a myriad of use cases.
There are about 23 different Software Design Patterns put together by the Gang of Four that can be grouped into three different categories:
Creational Pattern: These are patterns that pertain to object creation and class instantiation they help in the reuse of an existing code. The major creational patterns are Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, and Singleton.


Structural Pattern:  These are patterns that help simplify the design by identifying a way to create relationships among entities such as objects and classes. Th…</span>

Perhaps it is this familiarity with data that makes employees feel so connected to it when they change jobs. Even they often take some of it with them. Perhaps that is why most of them do not consider this a criminal act.
Whatever the reasons for this deliberate filtering of data; lack of security can affect the growth of an organization and its ability to maintain a competitive advantage. But with greater visibility into internal threats, organizations can expel bad players and improve overall security.

We might face the situation where we have to navigate the file system through a terminal or cmd because of lack of GUI  feature in the system like Servers. So it is must to know the basics of cd command.
cd command means Change Directory which is kind of self explanatory term. Now before jumping into the examples there is something we should know i.e, Paths in file system.
There are two types of paths in any operating system. 
Absolute Path
Relative Path
Absolute path is nothing but a path given from the root of the file system.
/home/user/Desktop/someDirectory

This is an example of absolute path because we have to provide the path from the bottom most part of the file system heirarchy.

  Recap


This tutorial is a follow up to the first tutorial found here on dev.to or on github on the to-do-list branch, where we built a to-do list generator using React and Fluree. If you are not familiar with Fluree, please refer to the first part of this tutorial series to learn the basics.
To get started git clone the repo via git clone https://github.com/fluree/version-2-lists-generator.git, or any other preferred method.


cd into the repo and run npm install

EDITOR’S NOTE: Crypto (digital currency) is becoming more mainstream with crypto exchange Coinbase’s IPO splash and the creation of the cyber yuan. Permission.io’s business model uses Auth0 to protect its platform while delivering digital currency in exchange for permission-based advertising. We invited their CTO, Hunter Jensen, to pen a post to share his thoughts on crypto’s future.
Today crypto is highly volatile — investing can be a real roller coaster. But that’s changing. We just saw the first public valuation of a cryptocurrency company, with Coinbase coming in at $86 billion. Governments are creating digital currency or at least talking about it.

This article reviews exactly what happened, how attackers gained access, how they used sensitive information and of course, what to do if you were affected. 
This breach was done by very sophisticated attackers who exploited a mistake in how Codecov built docker images. They used this to modify a script which allowed them to send the environment variables from the CI of Codecov customers to a remote server. While the attackers could have conducted multiple attacks from there, we can see based on other disclosures that one path they did take was accessing private git repositories from the git credentials in the CI environment, then exploiting secrets an…</span>

I did not actually use what I got, and reported the bug
I do not suggest people try to score free services through exploitations of lousy systems. This is meant to help secure those that are exposed
My hope is that developers become more vigilant with systems, especially ones that involve personal and medical information of literally everyone that crosses their country&#x27;s border
I do think however, that testing, at home for these kinds of bugs are contributing to the greater good of the internet.

                    <span>Digitization has revolutionized the way we work. Critical business applications and data are just a keystroke away, no matter where the employee is or what time. Perhaps it is this familiarity with data that makes employees feel so connected to it when they change jobs. Even they often take some of it with them. Perhaps that is why most of them do not consider this a criminal act.
Whatever the reasons for this deliberate filtering of data; lack of security can affect the growth of an organization and its ability to maintain a competitive advantage. But with greater visibility into internal threats, organizations can expel bad players and improve overall security.

                    <span>When it comes to information genuineness we tend to trust only renown sources. You know which sources to trust when you are reading information on social media, yes, we are talking about verified accounts on social media. In-order to minimize the continuously exploding phishing frauds in the inbox, Certifying Authorities have taken an initiative to issue verified mark certificates for brands to show their brand logo in the email inbox.
To make this challenging task a reality Google announced full support for the movement. This functionality will use BIMI standards (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) to show the verification mark within email clients.
BIMI provides a secure, global framework enabling email inboxes to display sender-designated logos for authenticated messages. It also includes protections to prevent senders from spoofing logos owned by other organizations


What are the benefits of BIMI? 
BIMI offers several important benefits to end users as well as to marketers across the globe.
BIMI can reduce the amount of phishing activities.
It offers improved email security by using existing email authentication technologies like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.
Provides a great opportunity for every marketers email to get read first because of logo recall.
BIMI increases the confidence in the mind of a recipient as they see a verified logo against the sender name.
What are Verified Mark Certificates ?
Verified Mark Certificate in Action

How to get Verified Mark Certificates?
As of now Google &amp; the BIMI group has not rolled out any specific date of its implementation. As per Google the pilot testing has started and will be made live for all by the end of 2020. An organization would require getting VMCs to show BIMI standard logos.
In case you would like to register for BIMI and want numerous VMC then contact us.  We will get back to you with all the relevant details at the earliest.</span>

                    <span>Internet of Things or IoT is the new age revolution in every business vertical these days. Especially during the pandemic, there has been a constant need for tracking symptoms related to COVID. Now that many countries have vaccinated a significant portion of their population, authorities are also looking to track people not vaccinated. 
While it may seem to be a great idea to use IoT-based solutions for tracking and tracing COVID-related data, security can be a concern here. According to a research paper prepared based on a security survey of more than 40 android apps used for contact tracing of COVID patients, tracking symptoms shows that about 55% of them store sensitive data in cleartext. At the same time, 55% of these applications also have been producing insecure random values.

Target Audience: Developers who want to try out Apple ‘Passkeys’ with their website and / or app and, for that, need to ‘adopt WebAuthn on their server’.
Apple announced at WWDC21 that WebAuthn credentials will be available as “Passkeys” in the iCloud Keychain, as well as the availability of system-wide WebAuthn APIs on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

                    <span>If you are a software developer and the major time write code in JavaScript (or TypeScript) this AutoHotKey can be useful.
with AutoHotKey you can remap some key behavior to write quick and easy all those operators used day to day.
You need to have installed AutoHotKey and create a file called js-remapkeys.ahk with this script.
#NoEnv ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
; #Warn  ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.
SendMode Input ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir% ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.

!7::Send {&amp;}{&amp;} ; Alt+7 -&gt; &amp;&amp;
!9::Send {(}{)}{ }{&#x3D;}{&gt;} ; Alt+9 -&gt; () &#x3D;&gt;
!+9:: Send {&#x3D;}{&gt;} ; Shift+Alt+9 -&gt; &#x3D;&gt;

!.:: Send {?}{.} ; Alt+. -&gt; ?.
!+/:: Send {?}{?} ; Shift+Alt+/ -&gt; ??

Save the file and open it with AutoHotkey.
Finally, we will have a powered keyboard for JS/TS development.

Hello there, This is Darshan Ponikar and today we are going to talk about switching from JavaScript to TypeScript! 
So get ready to resolve all your doubts you are having with TypeScript!

I am assuming that you are totally unaware of TypeScript. TypeScript, As name suggest it is a Type checking language!
TypeScript is not a brand new language! TypeScript is a super-set of JavaScript, which means you can still use the same syntax you have used in JavaScript! 
Before I tell you directly how does things work in TypeScript Let&#x27;s talk about our favourite language JavaScript.
JavaScript is a Runtime Language! That&#x27;s means everything happens at runtime. We cannot compile JavaScript like Java, C++, C.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m Chuck. This will be my first attempt at trying to contribute back to the community in some way and I&#x27;m going to try and do it in the realm of testing. So bear with me 🙂.  I appreciate all feedback and constructive feedback is the most helpful.
Throughout my career as a developer I have heard a lot of people agree that testing our code is something that we should all be doing. Conversely, I have not worked at many places that actually do it. Additionally, and surprisingly to me, rarely if ever do you see a tutorial show any kind of testing when they&#x27;re trying to teach something unless they&#x27;re specifically teaching testing.
While I understand that the focus of the lesson may not be testing, I think that if we really want to see testing adopted more widely across our industry then we…</span>

This article is part of what I call the magical directives series. In this series, we will unravel the mystery behind some interesting Angular directives. Afterwards, we can add this little magic to our tool box. I call them magical directives because they play a very important role in building reusable components across our Angular applications.
Below are the directives that we will be looking at in this series.

                    <span>This article outlines my migration from Arch Linux to Debian. The details about the migration are spanned across a few videos, but below is a reasonably short summary.
I moved back from macOS to Linux and I&#x27;m loving it!
Mohammed Ismail Ansari ・ Mar 18 ・ 2 min read
#linux
        #macos
        #setup
      
Arch gave me a fresh new direction to explore and experience Linux the way I never did before. I created a couple of reusable artifacts and it in a way became a base for my second YouTube channel.
Things kept breaking, and I found myself spending more time on fixing things than I expected, even with my prior experience with Linux before I spent four years on macOS.




So I started looking out for alternatives and found the exact thing I was looking for.
I couldn&#x27;t lose the control I had over my Linux setup back with Arch by delegating it to a graphical installer. So I installed Debian in the way we usually do install Arch.




All this learning had to be documented somewhere so I created another video talking about the process in a little bit of detail.
Moving to Debian meant re-setting up the entire machine, even deeper than what I had to do back when I moved the factory-installed Windows to a smaller partition to make space for my primary Linux partition.




The new setup took away a few issues I never got fixed, and in exchange, brought with it a few other ones. I talked about the similarities, differences, negatives, and most importantly, the positives of the migration in a separate video, adding another episode to my series Back to Linux.
As I did last time, I&#x27;ll keep my eyes open for ways to improve my setup and workflow, and will keep documenting my learning to be able to share them with the rest of the community.
Needless to say, I&#x27;m loving the alternate universe with Debian. Do throw in your ideas and thoughts in the comments and hopefully, we can learn something from each other.</span>

Today NGINX servers the majority of the world&#x27;s top 1000 websites and while this growth is largely due to, it&#x27;s also because NGINX is relatively easy to get started with.
There are two methods of installing NGINX on Ubuntu 20.04.
Via the operating system&#x27;s build-in packages manager.
Via building NGINX from the source.
In this guide, we’ll build NGINX from the source on Ubuntu 20.04.
To complete this tutorial, you will need to have an Ubuntu 20.04 server. for the sake of simplicity, we&#x27;ll be working as root during this guide.
In order to build NGINX from the source first, we need to install a couple of dependencies for NGINX.
Login to your server via SSH terminal.

BASH or Bourne Again Shell is an interface(program) between the user and the Operating System. BASH is just an application just like others, but not an ordinary one. It is quite powerful when used to its potential. It is used in various aspects of computing. No, it&#x27;s not only for server admins, but it specializes in that field though. We&#x27;ll see how we can use Bash to perform several tasks quite powerfully. Not just automation, you&#x27;ll be surprised what Bash is capable of.
BASH is just like any other shell such as z-shell, c-shell, Korn shell, and Bourne shell. BASH is a variant or update version of the BOURNE shell. Technically it has quite advanced features than the Bourne shell, such as arithmetic operators, signal handling, command-line completion, and tons of quality of l…</span>

                    <span>Hi, I want to write about some technical discussion about system designs, architecture designs, programming techniques and how to deal with troubles in real-world but I&#x27;ve found that it is very difficult to just explain topics via multiple arbitrary and unconnected examples. I&#x27;ve got some topics in my mind but I cannot convey them into words. My writing is not good enough. So I&#x27;m thinking of implementing some real product while writing about it at a same time. I can post all the design considerations here and will receive feedbacks which will help me (and maybe other people) a lot.
The problem is that I cannot think of any ideas about software/applications that are not only practical but also useful for real-life use cases. Simple case studies are good but I&#x27;m afraid of that the readers will lose the interest. So any suggestion would be welcome and appreciate.
Thank you very much.</span>

Before discussing dependency injection lets understand what are dependencies first
Dependencies are services or objects that the class needs to perform its function
Dependency Injection is a design pattern in which a class/ component request dependencies from external sources rather than creating them.
In Angular, Component or services are injected with dependencies via the constructor arguments.  Angular DI&#x27;s framework will provide dependencies calling the factory function to instantiate the dependencies. 
How Services are exposed to Inject?
Its using @Injectable decorator and dependency injection provider which is declared in service.

In the above service named AngProvidedDepService the if provided In is removed then you will get following error

                    <span>Introduction


Most of us have come across terms like multithreading, parallel processing, multiprocessing, concurrency, etc., though each of these terms has its own meaning. In a broader sense, we need these because we want to avoid some kind of latency (or have an illusion of doing so) in the execution of regular programs.
To do this, we try to write code that doesn’t necessarily runs in order (non-sequential) and all this boils down to two different concepts — concurrency and parallelism.
I came across concurrency when I was trying to download ~5000 images from the web. I had collected image URLs from Flickr, and these images had to be passed on to a team doing annotation (labelling).
This is how a sequential program to download images would look like:
import requests

                    <span>Today in this digital era developing a web application requires a reliable and dependable software stack. Modern-day developers are utilizing a blend of advanced technologies to get swifter and enhanced outcomes through their projects.
Increasing the use of MEAN Stack is one of the primary examples of this scenario. MEAN JS is utilized to craft robust and scalable web applications. Let’s explore what exactly is Mean Stack and how it can assist your business.
What is the MEAN stack?
Mean stack is the compilation and synergy of technologies applied to build web applications. MEAN is used by several Web App Development Companies, and it precisely stands for “MongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js.”
How does Mean stack architecture work?

The Mean Stack Architecture works in five stages.
Stage 1: Angular as a client-side language is the foremost one to work on the client request.
Stage 2: The client request then goes into NodeJS being the JavaScript server-side language.
Stage 3: ExpressJS is then into the process and makes a database request.
Stage 4: Then MongoDB retrieves the data and sends the response to ExpressJS.
Stage 5: NodeJS returns the data to the AngularJS to showcase the outcomes, and in return, the data is taken back from the ExpressJS.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>
