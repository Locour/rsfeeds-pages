                    <span>How to create a super simple accordion component in Angular. Using the power of content projection in Angular, we are going to build an accordion/expansion panel that can be customized in multiple ways.
Accordions in general are vertically stacked lists of headers when clicked reveals some content. Accordions or expandable sections are seen as part of almost all the UI libraries out there.
If we take a look at Angular material, we have Expansion Panel (ref) and in Ng Bootstrap its called simple Accordion (ref).
What we are gonna build is a much simpler version of these. And as always, the whole idea behind this is to help you explore some possibilities of Angular. This blog post would be mostly about how we can use Content Projection (ref) in Angular to create reusable and customizable UI …</span>

I find all the JS UI frameworks confusing. There are so many of them, each has its own syntax and structure, many components, and doesn&#x27;t use &quot;traditional&quot; JS/TS, but many placeholders that get &quot;replaced&quot; later on. I reached this conclusion recently when I started a new project (with a new company) and the UI part was done purely in Angular and the UI communicated with the BE using REST calls. The project had less than a month since it started, so I wasn&#x27;t quite from the start so I could not impose my view :D
This brings me to my next rant. The UI does soo many calls to the backe…</span>

                    <span>An immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) is often used to group related functionality into a single object or module. 
Ex:




let isCuteMixin &#x3D; function(obj) {
  obj.isCute &#x3D; function() {
    return true;
  };
};
let singMixin &#x3D; function(obj) {
  obj.sing &#x3D; function() {
    console.log(&quot;Singing to an awesome tune&quot;);
  };
};

We can group these mixins into a module as follows:




let funModule &#x3D; (function() {
  return {
    isCuteMixin: function(obj) {
      obj.isCute &#x3D; function() {
        return true;
      };
    },
    singMixin: function(obj) {
      obj.sing &#x3D; function() {
        console.log(&quot;Singing to an awesome tune&quot;);
      };
    }
  };
})();

Note that you have an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that returns an object funModule. This returned object contains all of the mixin behaviors as properties of the object. The advantage of the module pattern is that all of the motion behaviors can be packaged into a single object that can then be used by other parts of your code.</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(2 min)</span>
                    <span>A common pattern in JavaScript is to execute a function as soon as it is declared:




(function () {
  console.log(&quot;Chirp, chirp!&quot;);
})();

This is an anonymous function expression that executes right away, and outputs Chirp, chirp! immediately.
Note that the function has no name and is not stored in a variable. The two parentheses () at the end of the function expression cause it to be immediately executed or invoked. This pattern is known as an immediately invoked function expression or IIFE.


Let&#x27;s rewrite the function makeNest and remove its call so instead it&#x27;s an anonymous immediately invoked function expression (IIFE).




function makeNest() {
  console.log(&quot;A cozy nest is ready&quot;);
}

makeNest();

Answer:




(function () {
  console.log(&quot;A cozy nest is ready&quot;);
})();</span>

                    <span>In the previous post, bird had a public property name. It is considered public because it can be accessed and changed outside of bird&#x27;s definition.




bird.name &#x3D; &quot;Duffy&quot;;

Therefore, any part of your code can easily change the name of bird to any value. Think about things like passwords and bank accounts being easily changeable by any part of your codebase. That could cause a lot of issues.


The simplest way to make this public property private is by creating a variable within the constructor function. This changes the scope of that variable to be within the constructor function versus available globally. This way, the variable can only be accessed and changed by methods also within the constructor function.




function Bird() {
  let weight &#x3D; 15;

  this.getWeight &#x3D; function() {
    return weight;
  }
}
let ducky &#x3D; new Bird();
console.log(ducky.getWeight()); // will display 15

Here getWeight is a privileged method, because it has access to the private variable weight. This is possible because weight is declared in the same context as getWeight. In JavaScript, a function always has access to the context in which it was created. This is called closure.</span>

                    <span>As you have seen, behavior is shared through inheritance. However, there are cases when inheritance is not the best solution. Inheritance does not work well for unrelated objects like Bird and Airplane. They can both fly, but a Bird is not a type of Airplane and vice versa.
For unrelated objects, it&#x27;s better to use mixins. A mixin allows other objects to use a collection of functions.




let flyMixin &#x3D; function(obj) {
  obj.fly &#x3D; function() {
    console.log(&quot;Flying, wooosh!&quot;);
  }
};

The flyMixin takes any object and gives it the fly method.




let bird &#x3D; {
  name: &quot;Donald&quot;,
  numLegs: 2
};

let plane &#x3D; {
  model: &quot;777&quot;,
  numPassengers: 524
};

flyMixin(bird);
flyMixin(plane);

Here bird and plane are passed into flyMixin, which then assigns the fly function to each object. Now bird and plane can both fly:




bird.fly();
plane.fly();

The console would display the string Flying, wooosh! twice, once for each .fly() call.</span>

                    <span>In previous posts, you learned that an object can inherit its behavior (methods) from another object by referencing its prototype object:




ChildObject.prototype &#x3D; Object.create(ParentObject.prototype);

Then the ChildObject received its own methods by chaining them onto its prototype:




ChildObject.prototype.methodName &#x3D; function() {...};

It&#x27;s possible to override an inherited method. It&#x27;s done the same way - by adding a method to ChildObject.prototype using the same method name as the one to override. Here&#x27;s an example of Dog overriding the eat() method inherited from Animal:




function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat &#x3D; function() {
  return &quot;nom nom nom&quot;;
};

function Dog() { }
Dog.prototype &#x3D; Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.eat &#x3D; function() {
  return &quot;chew chew chew&quot;;
};

If you have an instance let beagle &#x3D; new Dog(); and you call beagle.eat(), this is how JavaScript looks for the method on beagle’s prototype chain:
beagle &#x3D;&gt; Is eat() defined here? No.


Dog &#x3D;&gt; Is eat() defined here? &#x3D;&gt; Yes. Execute it and stop searching.


Animal &#x3D;&gt; eat() is also defined, but JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.


Object &#x3D;&gt; JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.</span>

So far, Fusuma has only allowed you to set one type of action for a gesture globally.
In this article, we will install fusuma-plugin-appmatcher and configure application-specific settings on Fusuma&#x27;s config.yml.
Run the following command in a terminal
$ sudo gem install fusuma-plugin-appmatcher

To get application name (WM_CLASS) to specify in config.yml, use $ fusuma-appmatcher -l.
-l option, only foreground application names are retrieved.
$ fusuma-appmatcher -l

                    <span>Node.js is a very popular open source javascript runtime environment which is used to develop network applications. Node JS has gained massive popularity and now is used by thousands of developers all over the world for server-side programming.
Node.js is a platform built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses event-driven, non-blocking I/O for file system access, networking, and other API calls, allowing it to support thousands of concurrent connections with near-zero programming latency.
You can make really cool real-time web applications using Node Js. There are a whole bunch of libraries and modules available to help you achieve this.   
Node JS is a fast growing platform for running JS based applications outside of the browser. 
Node JS has rocked the world of web application and making some big waves in the tech market. It’s been around for quite some time back in 2009 but is now widely used. (Initial release    May 27, 2009)

When I call another software from Node.js, I use &quot;child_process&quot; like this.
[Windows][Node.js][TypeScript] Get installed printer driver names
&quot;child_process&quot; has four kind of methods(exclude &quot;Sync&quot; mehtods).
exec
execFile
fork
spawn
Because I wanted to know how to use them properly, I will try them.
Node.js ver.16.3.0
ts-node ver.10.0.0
TypeScript ver.4.3.2
According to the documents, they are based on &quot;child_process.spawn()&quot;.
import { exec, execFile, fork, spawn } from &quot;child_process&quot;;
import path, { resolve } from &quot;path/posix&quot;;

function start() {
    spawnSample(&#x27;powershell&#x27;,[&#x27;node&#x27;, &#x27;-v&#x27;]);
}

                    <span>Define npm scripts in your package.json:
&quot;start&quot;: &quot;ember serve&quot;,
&quot;test&quot;: &quot;ember exam --load-balance --parallel&#x3D;4&quot;,
&quot;lint&quot;: &quot;npm-run-all --parallel --aggregate-output lint:**&quot;,

and use those scripts, don&#x27;t use global commands.
Bad: ember test (yes, it&#x27;s bad even if you see it in the official docs)
Good: npm test
There are several benefits to using npm scripts instead of global commands:
No chance of local vs global package version mismatch that can lead to inexplicable errors
No chance of using the wrong command and/or options (for example, the default command for running tests in Ember projects is ember test, but a project might use ember exam and/or additional options like --load-balance --parallel&#x3D;4)
No need to remember specific commands for each type of project, because npm start and npm test are standard commands used by virtually every JavaScript project, be it an Ember project, a React project, or an Express project
No need to install global packages, keep track of their versions, and update them
If you really need to run a one-off command, use npx, it will protect you from local vs global package version mismatch (because it uses local package if it detects one):

                    <span>JavaScript has three ways to declare variables.





var width &#x3D; 100;
let height &#x3D; 200;
const key &#x3D; &quot;Tech Talks&quot;;

The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is limited to the “function” within which it is defined.
If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global.
var is function scoped



Block Example
{
 var a &#x3D; 10;
 console.log(a);
} //block 1
{
 a++;
 console.log(a);
} //block 2

We are using the keyword var to define the variable a, the scope of a is limited to the function within which it is defined.
Since a is not defined within any function, the scope of the variable a is global, which means that a is recognized within block 2
Function Example
function fun1() {
 var a &#x3D; 10;
 console.log(a);
} //function scope of fun1

function fun2() {
 a++;

                    <span>Olá, hoje quero falar sobre as operações de CRUD do AdonisJS.
AdonisJS é um framework MVC completo para o NodeJS.
Para programadores PHP o AdonisJS é comparado ao Laravel, a sua sintaxe é quase semelhante, sem falar que os dois usam Template Engine.
O AdonisJS é um framework NodeJS e para isso precisamos do NodeJS instalado no nosso computador. Para ser mais especifico, precisamos do NodeJS na versão igual ou superior a 14.15.4 e precisamos também do NPM instalado na versão igual ou superior a 6.0.0.
Você pode criar um novo projecto utilizando o npm init ou yarn create. Os dois comandos vão instalar os pacotes do AdonisJS no seu computador.
Nesse caso vamos usar o NPM.
Vamos abrir o terminal e escrever:
npm init adonis-ts-app@latest crud-operations
Depois de executar o comando no terminal você pode escolher entre 3 opções a sua estrutura de projecto.
web: estrutura de projecto ideal para a criação de aplicações clássicos renderizados para servidores. Nessa selecção vai ser configurado suporte para sessões e também o template engine do AdonisJS


api: estrutura de projecto ideal para criação de um servidor API


slim: estrutura de projecto ideal para criar a menor aplicação AdonisJS possível e não instala nenhum pacote adicional, expecto o núcleo do framework.



Para o nosso projecto vamos selecionar a estrutura API.
Podes ver mais sobre instalação de um projecto AdonisJS aqui.</span>

                    <span>What Is SSH?


SSH or Secure Shell allows people to have remote access to their servers. It uses cryptographic techniques to make sure all communication to and from the server happens in an encrypted way.
It gives you a method of authenticating remote users, transferring inputs from the client to the host and relay information back to the client.
Linux and macOS users can use the terminal to SSH into their remote server directly. Windows users have to use something like Putty.
You&#x27;re able to use shell commands in the same way you would if you were physically using the remote computer.
The SSH command has three pieces;
ssh {user}@{host}

SSH tells the system that you want to open an encrypted connection.


User is for the account you want to access (root &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; admin for example).

It&#x27;s a common mistake that every developer tends to make, especially early on: adding secrets to source-control or saving them somewhere else in plain-text. A good example of this is an API key stored in the web.config or settings.json.
Saving secrets as plain-text is a bad-practice can be a security risk. But where should you save your secrets? And how much does it cost to implement an alternative solution?
Azure Key Vault (AKV) is a service provided by Microsoft Azure that lets you store encryption keys, secrets and certificates. AKV can be easily integrated with almost any other service in Azure, but it doesn&#x27;t stop there. It can easily be integrated in other environments too: local machines, apps, if you want to go crazy you can even use it in an AWS environment.

                    <span>Hello Developers 🤩🤩🤩


Let&#x27;s admit it typing effect looks cool and the good news is we can achieve it without any pain 😜.
    npm install typed.js
    or
    yarn add typed.js
    or
    bower install typed.js

Let&#x27;s dive into the code.





import Typed from &quot;typed.js&quot;;
import { useEffect, useRef } from &quot;react&quot;;

export default function App() {
  // Create Ref element.
  const el &#x3D; useRef(null);

  useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
    const typed &#x3D; new Typed(el.current, {
      strings: [&quot;Handy&quot;, &quot;Mandy&quot;, &quot;Candy&quot;, &quot;More Strings&quot;], // Strings to display
      // Speed settings, try diffrent values untill you get good results
      startDelay: 300,
      typeSpeed: 100,
      backSpeed: 100,
      backDelay: 100
    });

    // Destropying
    return () &#x3D;&gt; {
      typed.destroy();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    
Hello Developers

    
 {
    const typed &#x3D; new Typed(el.current, {
      strings: [&quot;Handy&quot;, &quot;Mandy&quot;, &quot;Candy&quot;, &quot;More Strings&quot;], // Strings to display
      // Speed settings, try diffrent values untill you get good results
      startDelay: 300,
      typeSpeed: 100,
      backSpeed: 100,
      backDelay: 100,
      smartBackspace: true,
      loop: true,
      showCursor: true,
      cursorChar: &quot;!&quot;
    });

    // Destropying
    return () &#x3D;&gt; {
      typed.destroy();
    };
  }, []);
    ...


For TypeScript lovers it provide types by default.

When I call another software from Node.js, I use &quot;child_process&quot; like this.

&quot;child_process&quot; has four kind of methods(exclude &quot;Sync&quot; mehtods).
exec
execFile
fork
spawn
Because I wanted to know how to use them properly, I will try them.
Node.js ver.16.3.0
ts-node ver.10.0.0
TypeScript ver.4.3.2
According to the documents, they are based on &quot;child_process.spawn()&quot;.
import { exec, execFile, fork, spawn } from &quot;child_process&quot;;
import path, { resolve } from &quot;path/posix&quot;;

function start() {
    spawnSample(&#x27;powershell&#x27;,[&#x27;node&#x27;, &#x27;-v&#x27;]);

                    <span>How to create a super simple accordion component in Angular. Using the power of content projection in Angular, we are going to build an accordion/expansion panel that can be customized in multiple ways.
Accordions in general are vertically stacked lists of headers when clicked reveals some content. Accordions or expandable sections are seen as part of almost all the UI libraries out there.
If we take a look at Angular material, we have Expansion Panel (ref) and in Ng Bootstrap its called simple Accordion (ref).
What we are gonna build is a much simpler version of these. And as always, the whole idea behind this is to help you explore some possibilities of Angular. This blog post would be mostly about how we can use Content Projection (ref) in Angular to create reusable and customizable UI …</span>

                    <span>Hello there,
When I posted it, nueva can only render simple elements like div, p, h1 and others.
But now we can render it as a component. So that we can make it much cleaner and easy to build complex UI&#x27;s. Check the repo for an example
It is currently on v-0.0.9-full. We can add reactive values and all to the Element.
Check out the project:-
https://github.com/codingwith3dv/nueva
https://npmjs.org/package/nueva
Before you go please try contribute to the project and help it grow.
Thanks for reading till here

                    <span>In this post, you will learn how different ways declaring a ref with useRef hook influence the immutability of the current ref property. We will be looking at how to make the current property immutable, mutable, and know without much effort if the ref is one or the other.
All the behavior I&#x27;m going to talk about is only relevant in the context of TypeScript. The mutability / immutability is enforced at type level, not runtime level.
current property


The immutable semantics of the useRef hooks are usually used with DOM elements. A common use-case might be to get the ref of an element and focus that element whenever a button is clicked.
Here is how I would write that.
import * as React from &quot;react&quot;;

const Component &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
  const inputRef &#x3D; React.useRef(null);

                    <span>I&#x27;ve reached a point where I&#x27;m now really enjoying working with Typescript. I remember one of the senior engineers in my team telling me when I first started that I would find myself being a Typescript convert one day. I didn&#x27;t really believe it then, as TS seemed to be so much more of a hindrance than help in the early days (it wouldn&#x27;t even allow me to run my code to debug it!)...but I&#x27;m happy to say he was right. ✌🏻
I&#x27;ve reached the tipping point, where it now feels weird to NOT have Typescript switched on for a Javascript repo. There are, for sure, still days when I&#x27;m trying to get a specific scenario typed properly and I&#x27;m finding it difficult to even know what to Google for... but it gets easier over time as you start to build a bank of knowledge and realise that the same patterns k…</span>

I recently published an article about the compatibility opt-in preview version of Ivy in version 8 and what I experienced attempting to upgrade. This is a follow-on to show what the current upgrade path looks like using Angular v9.0.0-next.6 pre-beta, which contains optimizations for bundle size and performance as well as some bug fixes that were not present in v8’s preview.
As a reminder, Ivy is not ready for production. This is still a compatibility opt-in preview. Use at your own risk. Your mileage may vary.
I’ll be upgrading a large commercial application that leverages many third-party dependencies and a wide gamut of the Angular framework.
The initial step is to upgrade Angular:

                    <span>I started learning React 1 year ago. There was only one thing in my mind How Awesome is React.
Gradually I started thinking about my own website and came over an idea to launch a website, where I can share some technical stuff among people.
I started thinking and thinking🤔 about its architecture (Obviously I am not an architect🤪).
I got some options like ReactJS (Or NextJS), Angular, VueJS or Plain HTML-CSS-JS. Now it was totally on me, which one should I choose, obviously it was going to affect my audience and performance of website too.
I was also aware about the SEO part,🥰 obviously how could I forgot that, because that was the entrypoint of my orgaic readers.
Finally I had these options:
Angular
React (Or NextJS)
VueJS (Or NuxtJS)
Now I compared all of these and found something in Angular and React, which does not fits to my requirements.
Angular Too Hactic🤯
React Server Side Rendering was complex to achieve for a production grade application.😩
NextJS Server Side Rendering was supported, but deployment on personal server was removing some important features.😡
Now the last one
VueJS  I explored VueJS and found that there is a awesome framework on the top of Vue, NuxtJS. I explored it more and more and found these keypoints:
Server Side Rendering Support
Built on Top of VueJS
Lightweight
Can be deployed to own servers, without any performance loss
Open Source
Lot of Options For handling SEO
At this point, I had no doubts &amp; no questions. I had decided that I will go with NuxtJS and create this awesome site.
Now its been 1 month passed, everything is running fine and smoothly with NuxtJS.
Hashcodec.com now. We are planning to launch it on 01st June 2021.
Thanks For Reading This Guys.😇
Don&#x27;t forgot to visit our website Hashcodec.com

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic has turned the job market inside out. It&#x27;s now easier, and in some cases more profitable, for people to stay at home and look for a job. So the faster you can bring great talent onto your team, the better.
Speed and organization are necessary to keep a good applicant from slipping through the cracks. How are you going to meet that standard if your company receives hundreds of applications a day?

An applicant tracking system is software used by human resources that acts as a database for job applicants. They&#x27;re one of those hot little items that are becoming the norm for today&#x27;s HR teams. They allow companies of all sizes to organize, search, and communicate with large groups of applicants.

                    <span>Scenario:


You encountered a production issue. Immediately you stopped doing whatever you were working on and started fixing the bug. After fixing the bug you observe that you fixed the bug on a different branch. Now you want to move a certain number of commits from a branch A to branch B.
To move a small number of commits from A to B, use the git cherry-pick command
Say, you have the following branches
P ----- Q ----- R ------ S
F ----- G ----- H
(Note: P, Q, R, S, F, G, H are all commit hashes/ids)
and you want to move commits Q &amp; R to B(in front of H). You can do the following by
git checkout branchB
git cherry-pick Q
git cherry-pick R

This will result in
Branch B
F ----- G ----- H ----- Q ----- R
Basically, we first checkout to the branch where we want to add the commits, and cherry-pick the commits we want to move, in the order in which they appear in the first branch. Ensuring that the commits being cherry-picked are in sequential order is important or can result in complications.
Like I said, this method works if the number of commits is small, but to move a large number of commits we can use a better method
git checkout 
  
git rebase HEAD 

So, for the above example - moving Q &amp; R to branch B, the commands would be
git checkout branchB
git rebase --onto H P R
git rebase HEAD branchB

These two tricks should be enough for moving commits between branches.

                    <span>Azure Bicep is the new domain-specific language to deploy your resources in Azure using a declarative syntax. The main difference with ARM templates, Bicep uses a more concise syntax and helps you to scale your deployment without having to pull out your hairs. 
Bicep Doc in Microsoft Doc and Microsoft Learn
One of the big changes, Bicep is no longer only present on GitHub. Bicep is now present on Microsoft Doc.
Microsoft Learn 
Installation
You can install Bicep by using Howbrew on MacOs, by Windows Installer or Chocolatey on Windows, or by downloading the binary files on Linux. 
az bicep install

If you want to upgrade your current installation, you can use
az bicep upgrade

But if you use Azure CLI to install bicep, it will not update PATH, so you will need to do it manually after.

To do this, we strove to be early birds in the development world. We introduced new methodologies and were the first to try promising tools and offer them to our clients. To prevent the quality of work from suffering during our expansion, we decided to develop an internal product development metrics dashboard for controlling the quality of projects.
In six months, we developed a Ruby on Rails application called Pulse: a quality management dashboard that displayed all current projects and their statuses on one screen.</span>

                    <span>Session Manager Overview
Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that lets you manage your Amazon EC2 instances through an interactive one-click browser-based shell or through the AWS CLI.


Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.


Session Manager also makes it easy to comply with corporate policies that require controlled access to instances, strict security practices, and fully auditable logs with instance access details, while still providing end users with simple one-click cross-platform access to your Amazon EC2 instances.

Concepts used: Routing tables and Netmask
In this practical, We are going to use three Redhat Enterprise Linux Virtual Machines which are hosting by Oracle VirtualBox.
I already explained these Routing table and Netmask concepts in my previous blog, if you want to know these basic concepts then please refer this
Note: Before starting these VM&#x27;s, make sure that it is connected in Host-only adapter mode and the adapter name should be the same in all three VMs.

First step is to change the IP and set the Netmask by running the following command.

A way to do that, I want to show my way.
After that goes to deep folder, first searching files with regular expressions (Added asterix to code due to passing asterix cause passing all filenames to function) and executing that filename with our ${2} given function.
[[ -n ${2} ]] &amp;&amp; (${2} ${file})

Good, now can prepare change filename function and give it to this script. As you see ${file} will be our first argument ${1}.
function changeFileName() { mv $(pwd)/${1} $(pwd)/_${1}; }
export -f changeFileName

Ok than,
./check.sh .scss changeFileName

Now I added prefix underscore for all my related files in all folders.</span>

After I found out you could enable Vim mode in bash 
set -o vi is always the first line I add to by .bashrc.

Get the SQL Server on Linux for Docker Engine image



I&#x27;m running Docker on MacOS, I will use the SQL Server on Linux for Docker Engine at Docker Hub
   docker pull microsoft/mssql-server-linux

Set the settings and start the container
SQL Server on Linux for Docker Engine requires an environment setting to accept the EULA and set a strong SA password:
   ACCEPT_EULA &#x3D; Y
   SA_PASSWORD &#x3D; 

Run this in the terminal:
   docker run -e &#x27;ACCEPT_EULA&#x3D;Y&#x27; -e &#x27;SA_PASSWORD&#x3D;yourStrong(!)Password&#x27; -p 1433:1433 -d microsoft/mssql-server-linux

Copy a backup to the container




   docker cp &#x27;/tmp/DatabaseName.bak&#x27; mssql-server-linux:/tmp

Restore the backup




   RESTORE DATABASE DatabaseName FROM DISK&#x3D;&#x27;/tmp/DatabaseName.bak&#x27;
   WITH MOVE &#x27;DatabaseName&#x27; TO &#x27;/var/opt/mssql/data/DatabaseName.MDF&#x27;,
   MOVE &#x27;DatabaseName_log&#x27; TO &#x27;/var/opt/mssql/data/DatabaseName_log.ldf&#x27;
   Go

Connect with a docker command or an IDE like DataGrip




Using SQL Server for Linux in Docker has allowed me to continue to develop using a Linux distro or macOS without needing to set up a VM to run the database backend.</span>

                    <span>Javascript is a prototype-based language. It means that every native function can receive custom functions or having its original functions modified.
In this article, we will create a custom filter function. For who doesn&#x27;t know, the filter function is an array prototype function that returns all elements that match against the callback passed as argument. For more information about filter you can check the MDN Doc.
So, without further ado, let&#x27;s code!
const data &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

Array.prototype.myCustomFilter &#x3D; function (fn) {
  const filtered &#x3D; []; // it will receive all values that match to condition passed in fn callback.

  for (let i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; this.length; i++) {
    if (fn(this[i])) {
      filtered.push(this[i]);
    }
  }

                    <span>Getting your battery capacity in GNU/Linux is pretty simple since it does not rely on any third-party libraries or programs. You can just read it directly from a file. Using Node, this operation gets very trivial and can be as simple as below.
$ touch index.js

const {promises: {readFile}} &#x3D; require(&quot;fs&quot;);

const append &#x3D;
  newString &#x3D;&gt;
    string &#x3D;&gt;

    string.trim();

const main &#x3D; async () &#x3D;&gt; {
  const capacity &#x3D;

                    <span>If you are using Node.js but don’t like its package manager npm, or want a more secure Javascript runtime environment than Node.js, then Deno is for you. It is a program for running Javascript and Typescript code outside of a browser. It is an attempt to reimagine Node.js with the advances in Javascript since 2009, including Typescript compiler. Like Node.js, Deno is basically a shell around the Google V8 JavaScript engine, although dissimilar to Node.js it includes the TypeScript compiler for its executable image. If you are still confused between Deno and Node.js, then this article is for you. Here we’ll discuss the comparison of Deno and Node.js. But before digging to the comparison let’s see the overview of each one.
It executes Typescript and JavaScript to asynchronous desktop servers and apps. Deno is the new implementation which uses modern features of JS language. It is a secure runtime for Typescript and Javascript that uses Google’s V8 and core is built in Rust. Here are some of the advantages of Deno.
Benefits Of Deno-
Supports Typescript
Uses a single executable file
It has a well designed module system
Built-in dependency inspector
It has a code formatter
It takes care of security
Node.js is a server-side javascript environment, based on Google’s JS engine. It is focused on the event-driven HTTP servers. Node.js is an easy-to-built platform which is a scalable and fast network application. It has an event-driven I/O model and non-blocking Node.js which makes it highly efficient. Also, it is a great solution for data-intensive and real-time apps that can run on distributed devices.

Imagine a really big airport, like Hartsfield–Jackson Airport in Atlanta (U.S) or Beijing International Airport (China) with hundreds of airline offices, a lot of flights arriving and leaving, employees doing their different jobs, and many people going around. Even if we don&#x27;t know exactly how everything works in an airport, we can be sure that it works.

Well, to understand Identity access management (IAM) we can think of Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a big Airport with hundreds of services (airlines), traffic between services (flights), and many users with different roles taking advantage of cloud services (people).

Mystery malware steals 26M passwords from millions of PCs. Are you affected?


I know, it&#x27;s terrifying!.
Excerpt from the article:
The stash also included over 1 million images and more than 650,000 Word and .pdf files. Additionally, the malware made a screenshot after it infected the computer and took a picture using the device’s webcam. Stolen data also came from apps for messaging, email, gaming, and file-sharing. The data was extracted between 2018 and 2020 from more than 3 million PCs.

                    <span>The landscape of malware has shifted dramatically in the past decade or so. Computer viruses that were developed to wreak havoc on companies and individuals by self-replicating, and slowing down or wiping out systems have evolved into big business. Not to diminish the severity of these types of malware, some of them caused billions of dollars in damage. However, the cost of these early viruses usually came in the form of lost revenue due to downtime while the systems were repaired, along with the hit to a company&#x27;s reputation and customer confidence. Many also resulted in stolen data, leading to compromised credentials and identity theft. But more and more, attackers are shifting to a different type of malware for their attacks.

Lastly but by no means least, carrying on from my previous blog about website security week, we&#x27;re going to talk about CSP or Content Security Policy.
CSP is Content Security Policy this is one of the most powerful tools in your arsenal to secure your website.
These are two ways to to set your content security policy, either as a header Content-Security-Policy or via a meta tag in your HTML for example:





The content policy is made up of directives (the thing to restrict) and the value(s) on how it can be restricted. We won&#x27;t cover all all the possible directives in this blog but you can find a list…</span>

                    <span>📕 Learn how to build a realtime chat application with Spring Boot, Auth0 and Ably.


When developing a service, one of the main hurdles to consider is authentication. For every action, you’ll need to both authorize the user (check they are who they say they are) and then ensure they can only do actions which they have permission to do.
Auth0, an authentication and authorization platform, simplifies this process immensely. Not only does it allow for easy integration with your own login systems, it makes integrating other login services such as Google and Twitter simple. It allows for a simple setup of permissions, roles with set permissions attached, and for these roles to be assigned to users. These users can then make use of various login systems to access the same account and thus have the same permissions associated with them.
With Spring Boot, this is extremely powerful, partially due to the strong integration of Auth0 with it. A simple redirect to an Auth0 login page will return a token which a Spring Boot server can use to verify the user and access their associated permissions.
This token can then be used to correctly generate access to other services. For example, Ably, a real-time communications solution, makes use of tokens to authenticate with an Ably App. Once a user has authenticated with Auth0 and has an Auth0 token, they can use this to request a token from a Spring Boot server to authenticate directly with Ably, with the appropriate permissions and access granted.
In this tutorial, we’ll be going through the basics of setting up an interoperating system as described above. The actual service we’ll be providing is a chat application, which will:
Allow users to sign in using a Google account
Signed in users will be able to publish messages to a group chat
Non-signed in users will be able to subscribe and read messages published
Users will be able to see who is online in the chat
Users will, when joining, be able to load the last 20 messages of conversation they’ve missed

                    <span>I have lost count of the number of times I&#x27;ve forgotten the password to the local or development CMS.
My natural instinct is to click the Forgot Password link but, obviously, there&#x27;s no way to trigger that email from the local system.
I&#x27;ve spent too long hunting through articles on how to recover the forgotten password. The quickest and easiest solution that I&#x27;ve found is to change the password manually in the database.

WordPress stores passwords in the wp_users table. The prefix may be different if you have elected to change that in the wp-config.php file. It&#x27;s good practice to do that for security.
When you look at the table, it&#x27;ll look a little like this…



ID
user_login
user_pass

WordPress stores your password as an MD5 hashed string. This prevents anyone with access to the database seeing confidential information in plain text.
If this wasn&#x27;t obfuscated like this, we&#x27;d be able to copy our password and paste it into the login form…but we can&#x27;t - and for good reason!
So, to fix our little problem, we need to replace the existing hashed password with a new hashed password - we can&#x27;t overwrite the MD5 hash with plain text because that won&#x27;t work.
I have Hasher installed as a plugin in VS Code. If you don&#x27;t use VS Code or don&#x27;t want to use this extension, MD5 Hash Generator Online works pretty well.
I would recommend that you don&#x27;t create your &quot;forever password&quot; using these hash generators though. Overwrite the existing password with something easy to remember and very, very temporary - a favourite of mine is Pa55word! —

Once the password has been changed, you can log in with your new password and immediately change it to something more secure.
I hope this helps you as much as it has helped me. 😎</span>

                    <span>Working with arrays in a functional way has mostly become the default when working with JavaScript these days. Why should you use a traditional imperative loop, like for, for..of, while, do..while, etc., when you can use map, filter, and forEach?
These functional methods have one caveat, though: You can never throw from them without aborting the whole pipeline.
someArray.map((value) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (someConditionMet) {
    throw new Error(&#x27;...&#x27;); // this is not the best idea...
  }
  // ...
  return someValidValue;
});

So what do you do then? Well, you can return null to mark that you have an invalid result.
someArray.map((value) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (someConditionMet) {
    return null; // now the pipeline can continue
  }
  // ...
  return someValidValue;
});

The beauty of typescript is supposed to be safety. But safety is hard to achieve and at some point typescript may not let you do something that you can tell will work.
This is good. It will make you write a bit more code to explain yourself to typescript.
Let&#x27;s say you want to write a function that can take 2 arguments, and return an array between those two values.
range(3, 5) // returns [3, 4, 5]

So far this is not too dificult with typescript. Let&#x27;s make a little for loop to do it.
function range(start: number, end: number): number[] {
  let newArr: number[] &#x3D; [start]
  for (let i&#x3D;start+1; i&lt;&#x3D; newEnd; i++) {
    newArr.push(i)
  }
  return newArr
}

                    <span>TypeScript provides some built-in utility types that help facilitate transformations of types from one form to another.
These utilities are available globally. They can be quite handy in various situations.
Before understanding the TypeScript utility types, it is important to understand type aliases and generics. You can create type aliases for any existing type in TypeScript.
type MyString &#x3D; string;

let helloWorldMessage: MyString &#x3D; &#x27;Hello Wisdom Geek&#x27;;

Type generics are used to create reusable type aliases. Let us say we had an identity function which returns whatever value is passed back in:

                    <span>Have you ever written code like this?
const myFunction &#x3D; (argument) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (argument &#x3D;&#x3D; null) {
    throw new Error(&#x27;argument is a required argument&#x27;);
  }
}

Guarding against invalid arguments is perfectly fine. It&#x27;s way better than failing at some random point in your function with a usually pretty obscure error message. But writing guard statements over and over again can bloat code pretty fast.
You could, of course, write a helper function for this, like the one below, which is already better.
const assertPresent &#x3D; (value, name) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (value &#x3D;&#x3D; null) throw new Error(&#x60;${name} is a required argument&#x60;);
};

You can then assert the presence of a parameter on the first lines of your function like this:
const myFunction &#x3D; (argument) &#x3D;&gt; {
  assertPresent(argument, &#x27;argument&#x27;);

We write JavaScript and get .ts feedback, its a nice middle-ground, I have never considered, I want the benefits of TS without the overhead of scaring others who don&#x27;t know it (know your audience of developers).
In our product, we have some java classes injected into Rhino, and so I want type defs for when I write unit tests in our Mocha like Rhino framework. 
jar tf TicTacToe.jar to get the contents, aka the com.path.to.Class structure in slash format
I do some string transforms to stdout and write all possilbe

                    <span>As awesome as flexbox is, what it’s doing under the hood is actually a little strange because, by default, it is doing two things at once. It first looks at the content size which is what we would get if by declaring width: max-content on an element. But on top of that, flex-shrink is also doing some work allowing the items to be smaller, but only if needed.
Let’s break those two down and see how they work together.

                    <span>In this example I am going to explain you that You can use library to generate breadcrumbs, and also set each page title dynamically.
first you need to install this library to your angular project.
npm install set-title-with-breadcrumbs
This will install library called set-title-with-breadcrumbs, this library is used to generate breadcrumbs component and also you can set page title using angular router. After installing this library..
Go to your app.module.ts file and add below code
import { SetTitleWithBreadcrumbsModule} from &#x27;set-title-with-breadcrumbs&#x27;;
    @NgModule({
        imports : [SetTitleWithBreadcrumbsModule]
    })

in side your app-routing.module.ts file you have to add new data:{} object with breadcrumbs and title object property.
const routes: Routes &#x3D; [
  {
    path: &#x27;home&#x27;,
    component: HomeComponent,
    data: { title: &#x27;Home Page&#x27;, breadcrums: &#x27;Home&#x27; },
    children: [
      {
        path: &#x27;records&#x27;,
        component: RecordsComponent,
        data: { title: &#x27;Find Records Page&#x27;, breadcrums: &#x27;Find-Records&#x27; },
        children: [
          {
            path: &#x27;child&#x27;,
            component: ChildComponent,
            data: { title: &#x27;Child Record Page&#x27;, breadcrums: &#x27;Child-Record&#x27; }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]

as you can see above, each router-path has data object with two property - breadcrumbs and title.
Now inside your app.component.html file you need to add component of library.

                    <span>Hello everyone 👋,
In this article, we are going to cover what is Angular Pipe, how to create it and utilize it in our template. Additionally, we will learn how to boost performance with a custom Pipe. 
From  Angular Documentation, 
Use pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, and other data for display. Pipes are simple functions you can use in template expressions to accept an input value and return a transformed value.
Usecase of pipe:
Use DatePipe to convert the Date object to a human-readable format.
UpperCasePipe can be used to convert text to Uppercase.
CurrencyPipe helps to transform a number to a currency string, formatted according to locale rules.
The best advantage to use Pipe is, while transforming the data, it doesn&#x27;t modify the original data. Let&#x27;s see it in acti…</span>

                    <span>One of the more daunting thing of developing, is to get to know how to deploy, as it&#x27;s almost guaranteed that you will incur in some kind of cost, so before doing the big jump to trying a VPS (as a service), I decided to make a local Virtual Server to do some testing in setting up server environments.
Well, to give a little explanation of what I was doing, I need to explain how to web works.
Now and then I have been mentioning about Front-end and Back-end, in some way, you can rename both to Client-Side and Server-Side. The Client is often you, the end-user, whoever visits the web app or webpage, technically the client-side code is executed by the browser and do whatever needs to be done. Typically, it means to fetch, display, and update data.

                    <span>wp-content/uploads was done quickly, but Wordpress Media Library didn’t “see” the files. 
After some quick reading I found out that they need to be imported into the Library, and after some more reading I found wp-cli works with ‘xargs’ in Bash.
Helpful links at Dev Notes and StackOverflow
The command I ended using is as follows through SSH:
find /tmp -name &#x27;*.pdf&#x27; -or -name &#x27;*.doc&#x27; -or -name &#x27;*.jpg&#x27; -or -name &#x27;*.xls&#x27; -or -name &#x27;*.docx&#x27; -or -name &#x27;*.xlsx&#x27; | xarg wp media import

Then you can regenerate all the thumbnails using
wp media regenerate --all

I recommend using screen as the import could stop if the connection gets down, because for me on a Digital Ocean server with 2gb took around 2-3 hours.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>
