                    <span>What is the dependency inversion principle?


The dependency inversion principle is one of the standard guiding rules of software design and development to ensure component extensibility and loosely-coupled components.
Simply said, the dependency inversion principle states that we need to rely on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
System coupling is defined as the constraining state of one item to another item inside a system. Coupling occurs on context information. For example, in an air-conditioner, the compressor is said to be coupled to the internal cooling refrigerant and cooling mechanism, since these components together make up the entirety of the cooling system.
Coupling can be of two types: tight coupling and loose coupling. These refer to how a system would react ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Hi, I want to write about some technical discussion about system designs, architecture designs, programming techniques and how to deal with troubles in real-world but I&#x27;ve found that it is very difficult to just explain topics via multiple arbitrary and unconnected examples. I&#x27;ve got some topics in my mind but I cannot convey them into words. My writing is not good enough. So I&#x27;m thinking of implementing some real product while writing about it at a same time. I can post all the design considerations here and will receive feedbacks which will help me (and maybe other people) a lot.
The problem is that I cannot think of any ideas about software/applications that are not only practical but also useful for real-life use cases. Simple case studies are good but I&#x27;m afraid of that the readers will lose the interest. So any suggestion would be welcome and appreciate.
Thank you very much.</span>

Before discussing dependency injection lets understand what are dependencies first
Dependencies are services or objects that the class needs to perform its function
Dependency Injection is a design pattern in which a class/ component request dependencies from external sources rather than creating them.
In Angular, Component or services are injected with dependencies via the constructor arguments.  Angular DI&#x27;s framework will provide dependencies calling the factory function to instantiate the dependencies. 
How Services are exposed to Inject?
Its using @Injectable decorator and dependency injection provider which is declared in service.

In the above service named AngProvidedDepService the if provided In is removed then you will get following error

                    <span>Introduction


Most of us have come across terms like multithreading, parallel processing, multiprocessing, concurrency, etc., though each of these terms has its own meaning. In a broader sense, we need these because we want to avoid some kind of latency (or have an illusion of doing so) in the execution of regular programs.
To do this, we try to write code that doesn‚Äôt necessarily runs in order (non-sequential) and all this boils down to two different concepts ‚Äî concurrency and parallelism.
I came across concurrency when I was trying to download ~5000 images from the web. I had collected image URLs from Flickr, and these images had to be passed on to a team doing annotation (labelling).
This is how a sequential program to download images would look like:

Hearing of Fedora thirty-four which has just officially launched, doing a fresh install of the operating system (OS) had been emerging in my mind, all the time. But how could clean installation clean up the mess? Nay, that is not possible! Once I got my hands dirty, everything will not be alright. Consequently, I have thoughts of keeping myself away from messing around for this time.
As many of people in many different communities have mentioned what is new in the thirty-four edition, followed by how-tos when installing Fedora for the first time, or even again, I have nothing more to share. Still and all, it is rather not a bad idea to capture and talk about decisions I have made.‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>What is a Middleware?:


According to wikiperdia, 
Middleware is a type of computer software that provides services to software applications beyond those available from the operating system. It can be described as &quot;software glue&quot;.
In our case, express js middleware is a functionality that runs between a request to the server and the response from the server.
Built-in Middleware:
express.static: serves static assets such as HTML files, images, and so on.
express.json: parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.
express.urlencoded: parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads.
Third Party Middleware:
Middleware installed via npm
Custom Middleware:
Created by you - the developer - for a project.
Application or Route Level:




const express &#x3D; require(&#x27;express&#x27;);

//Start express app.
const app &#x3D; expree();

//Apply a single middleware
app.use(middleware);

//Apply multiple middleware
app.use(middleware1, middleware2);

//Or via an array 
const middlewareArr &#x3D; [middleware1, middleware2];
app.use(middlewareArr);

Endpoint Level:




//Apply a single middleware
app.get(&#x27;/&#x27;, middleware, (res, req) &#x3D;&gt; {};

//Apply multiple middleware
app.get(&#x27;/&#x27;, middleware1, middleware2, (res, req) &#x3D;&gt; {};

//Or via an array 
const middlewareArr &#x3D; [middleware1, middleware2];

                    <span>What is ESLint?


ESLint is an open-source Javascript linting utility originally created by Nicholas C. Zakas in June 2013. It is frequently used to find problematic patterns or code that doesn‚Äôt adhere to certain style guidelines. ESLint is written using Node.js to provide a fast runtime environment and easy installation via npm.
JavaScript, being a dynamic and loosely-typed language, is especially prone to developer error. ESLint lets you put guidelines over coding standard and helps you to minimize those errors. The main reason for imposing those guide is because every developer has her style of writing (like naming conventions/tabs/single or double quotes for a string). And, with different styling techniques, your codebase may look weird, more error-prone and vulnerable. Especially whe‚Ä¶</span>

When I upload large files in ASP.NET Core applications, I slice the data and send them, after finishing uploading all sliced data, I merge them.

Because both client-side and server-side JavaScript had had &quot;Stream&quot;, so I thought I could send file data by them.

                    <span>Hi, I want to write about some technical discussion about system designs, architecture designs, programming techniques and how to deal with troubles in real-world but I&#x27;ve found that it is very difficult to just explain topics via multiple arbitrary and unconnected examples. I&#x27;ve got some topics in my mind but I cannot convey them into words. My writing is not good enough. So I&#x27;m thinking of implementing some real product while writing about it at a same time. I can post all the design considerations here and will receive feedbacks which will help me (and maybe other people) a lot.
The problem is that I cannot think of any ideas about software/applications that are not only practical but also useful for real-life use cases. Simple case studies are good but I&#x27;m afraid of that the readers will lose the interest. So any suggestion would be welcome and appreciate.
Thank you very much.</span>

Well, NodeJS is neither a framework nor a programming language.

Node.js¬Æ is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome&#x27;s V8 JavaScript engine
Let&#x27;s dig deeper and understand this better.

It all started in 2009, when javascript was primarily used to run inside a browser. We could embed javascript code in a webpage‚Äôs HTML and achieve all sorts of benefits like adding events to pages, calling APIs, adding animations etc.

What is a database?
It‚Äôs just a base/place for data, it&#x27;s as simple as that.
However, the bigger question is ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt you use something like an excel sheet to store data?‚Äù
The answer is yes you can but it depends more on what you‚Äôre trying to do
An excel sheet is perfect if you‚Äôre the only person using/updating the data, now when you scale up to more than say 3 people (in different locations), try to have the excel file store the most up-to-date data as possible, you‚Äôll see exactly why the excel file is a terrible idea.
What are the different types of databases?

Some things you may not know about me: I worked alongside network engineers and cybersecurity professionals for a while before deciding that Software Engineering was the technical discipline that I was drawn to.
When I went back to school to &quot;make it official&quot; (even though I&#x27;ve been a software engineer for years) I picked Software Engineering and Security as my major, because I hadn&#x27;t quite dropped that interest in security.
It never came up in real life until I joined my current team, where my actual title is Senior Product Security Engineer. It was super cool to finally get to apply things from my education to my day to day work.
At this point, I have only a capstone course left in my degree, so I know about as much information as a baccalaureate software security program ‚Ä¶</span>

These conversations have made their way into our lives on a regular basis. Especially during the pandemic, the number of hacks has increased and have made global news. Our lives are so dependent on the internet, knowingly or unknowingly, we put out a lot of information onto the internet which makes it easier for the attackers or ‚ÄúHackers‚Äù to target you. More Information leads to easier targeting of us and our systems. A lot of bank frauds, or any kind of financial frauds, happen mostly due to the information available on the internet and finding other ways to get information from our life.

Well a major limitation of the Web Animation API and consequently @okikio/animate, was that it didn&#x27;t support custom easing, this limitation is on the verge of being removed.

Yeah, you can hack it with keyframes today, but it&#x27;d be nice if it could be could be used within keyframes. Something like linear-easing(0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1) or whatever would be enough.

Here&#x27;s a little demo to test that https://static-misc-3.glitch.me/linear-easing/.
Cases like bounce are tricky due to sudden changes of direction, but 50 points seems to do well.
View on GitHub
Using the fact that WAAPI allows for linear easing, I created a small function that generates a set of arrays that create custom easing effects like bounce, elastic, and spring. As of right now it builds on top of @okikio/animate but that isn&#x27;t absolutely necessary, it just may not be as comfortable as using it with @okikio/animate. 
You can view a demo below,




As of right now if I add this to the @okikio/animate library it will more than double the size of the library (Note: treeshaking the actual package @okikio/animate while custom easing isn&#x27;t in use will cause it to excluded from the final build reducing the size down to ~5.79 KB).
I&#x27;m not sure if I should make Custom Easing a separate package or build it directly into @okikio/animate, please tell me what you think in the comments below.</span>

A primeira caracter√≠stica confusa de var √© a possibilidade de declarar a mesma vari√°vel v√°rias vezes. Ou, em outras palavras, declarar m√∫ltiplas vari√°veis com o mesmo nome:
var x &#x3D; 10;
var x &#x3D; 15; // Vari√°vel &#x60;x&#x60; foi criad‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Over a year ago, a colleague of mine and me were searching for a javascript-component capable for tree-rendering. There were a few must-have aspects we were looking for:
Zero runtime-dependencies (especially no JQuery)
Actively maintained
Framework-agnostic
Good integration with modern bundlers
These requirements did already reduce the number of possible libraries to a considerable degree. In addition, we had to consider the requirements of our product as well:
Text-search through tree-nodes
Mode where the tree is rendered in a container
Dropdown-mode for single-selection
Dropdown-mode for multi-selection
Neither did any component meet our requirements, nor did using two libraries for the different use-cases turn out to be sufficient. So we started considering the effort of ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Angular Dependency Injection


Before discussing dependency injection lets understand what are dependencies first
Dependencies are services or objects that the class needs to perform its function
Dependency Injection is a design pattern in which a class/ component request dependencies from external sources rather than creating them.
In Angular, Component or services are injected with dependencies via the constructor arguments.  Angular DI&#x27;s framework will provide dependencies calling the factory function to instantiate the dependencies. 
How Services are exposed to Inject?
Its using @Injectable decorator and dependency injection provider which is declared in service.

In the above service named AngProvidedDepService the if provided In is removed then you will get following error

  Install





sudo npm install typescript -g

or
brew install typescript

tsc 

If I have a file named &quot;index.ts&quot;
tsc index.ts

The TypeScript compiler essentially converts a TypeScript File to a JavaScript File. It produces a new .js file.
index.ts -&gt; index.js (a new file, doesn&#x27;t overwrite .ts file)

It also checks for errors in your code
It helps you configure your compiler.
tsc -init

You can configure the root to all your typescript files and the destination where you&#x27;d like the converted javascript files to be stored
// tsconfig.json 
{
   &quot;src&quot; : &quot;path to root folder with typescript files&quot;,
   &quot;dist&quot;: &quot;path to the folder where you want converted javascript files to be stored&quot;
}

                    <span>Today in this digital era developing a web application requires a reliable and dependable software stack. Modern-day developers are utilizing a blend of advanced technologies to get swifter and enhanced outcomes through their projects.
Increasing the use of MEAN Stack is one of the primary examples of this scenario. MEAN JS is utilized to craft robust and scalable web applications. Let‚Äôs explore what exactly is Mean Stack and how it can assist your business.
What is the MEAN stack?
Mean stack is the compilation and synergy of technologies applied to build web applications. MEAN is used by several Web App Development Companies, and it precisely stands for ‚ÄúMongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js.‚Äù
How does Mean stack architecture work?

The Mean Stack Architecture works in five stages.
Stage 1: Angular as a client-side language is the foremost one to work on the client request.
Stage 2: The client request then goes into NodeJS being the JavaScript server-side language.
Stage 3: ExpressJS is then into the process and makes a database request.
Stage 4: Then MongoDB retrieves the data and sends the response to ExpressJS.
Stage 5: NodeJS returns the data to the AngularJS to showcase the outcomes, and in return, the data is taken back from the ExpressJS.

This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating your Angular application using Routers. We&#x27;ll learn the basics of Router outlets, navigations, routes, and paths to generate a complete Angular Single Page Application (SPA).  
For you to be able to follow this tutorial along, it&#x27;ll be a necessity to have basic knowledge of Angular.
Angular Router is a core part of Angular that aids in building a single-page application. It&#x27;s located in the @angular/router package.  
It has a complete routing library for constructing multiple route outlets. It also supports several features such as lazy loading and routing guards for access control et cetera.
Routes are objects. At the lowest level, they comprise Angular components and paths, and sometimes redirectTo. This provides ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Welcome to the weird notes of a new DevOps and Backend engineer. This is my (quite open) notebook on what was all the stuff I read and learnt. Not necessarily tech, you can just read on and understand what I am rambling on about.
So, the current opentelemetry sentry-exporter is indeed incomplete right now. I investigated the elastic APM exporter and realised that Sentry one is just not using it&#x27;s full capabilities yet. You need to run span.Events() to get a list of events which can be further converted into *sentry.Event.


Also, in the prometheus-operator helm chart, we figured out how to add additional rules without having to &quot;upgrade the chart&quot; without putting in new values in values.yaml. Just create a new PrometheusRule object as a rule file and the ConfigMaps will auto grab it.
PS: I am talking about this operator here : kube-prometheus




  
  
  Stuff I need to check out tomorrow? üìÖ



How do i link a sentry span and a sentry issue.
Talk with team and refine the requirements because hell no, Sentry is not a logging platform (or I am an idiot)
Get vaccinated ffs üò¢
IF I manage to pull this issue linking stuff off, I think I will contribute this to opentelemetry collector exporter. My first cloud native contribution might be on its way idk man.
Thanks for listening to the rant.

Those guides are great for introducing all the advantages of Docker containers in modern cloud-native development, but creating a container that passes muster in a large-scale application in production is a different story. 
For production-ready containers, there are three key things you want to optimise for when creating a container:
Image Size üì¶
Build Speed üê¢
Security üîê
Image size and build speed ensure that your containers can move through CI/CD and test pipelines easily and efficiently. Security is obviously critical in today&#x27;s software supply chain, and containers have their own set of security i‚Ä¶</span>

Whether you&#x27;ve been working with Azure for some time, or only recently started - You will have likely heard of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates.
Let&#x27;s do a brief level-set, just in case you haven&#x27;t heard of ARM templates! ARM Templates are a type of Infrastructure as Code. They allow you to define your Azure Infrastructure using code in a declarative way. Rather than saying how you want things to be created (e.g. Azure CLI/PowerShell), you specify what you want to be created. Azure then &#x27;makes it happen&#x27;.
Azure Resource Manager hasn&#x27;t always been a part of Azure though. ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Time has gone when people have to stand in a queue to get appointments with their doctors. Even before the advent of a pandemic age, people could consult the doctor over their mobile phone without wasting time standing on a long waiting list. But, with a doctor appointment booking app, users can consult any specialist conveniently while sitting at their place. These apps have some unique features that let doctors to get accurate data of the patients in real-time. Also, healthcare organizations can easily implement the telemedicine concept with the help of on-demand healthcare apps.
Not only patients but also doctors find such apps highly useful. As per the data, around 80% of physicians use medical apps regularly. According to a survey, approximately 1.7 billion smartphone users have a hea‚Ä¶</span>

Those guides are great for introducing all the advantages of Docker containers in modern cloud-native development, but creating a container that passes muster in a large-scale application in production is a different story. 
For production-ready containers, there are three key things you want to optimise for when creating a container:
Image Size üì¶
Build Speed üê¢
Security üîê
Image size and build speed ensure that your containers can move through CI/CD and test pipelines easily and efficiently. Security is obviously critical in today&#x27;s software supply chain, and containers have their own set of security i‚Ä¶</span>

So want to learn how to install multiple versions of PHP on the Ubuntu system? Okay, that‚Äôs great.
Let‚Äôs assume, you have
OS: Ubuntu 16.04
PHP: 7.1 (PHP-FPM)
Nginx: 1.10
And want to install PHP 7.2.
Run the following commands to update the PHP repository &amp; the Ubuntu system
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt update

Now you are able to install the new version of PHP

                    <span>What are &quot;Callbacks&quot;?


A callback function is usually used as a parameter to another function.
The function that receives callback function is normally fetching data from a database, making an API request, downloading a file, which usually takes a while.
Assume getting some data from the API and the request takes around 2 seconds to complete. 

Now, you can either wait for the API call to complete and then display your UI,
OR, you show everything else and show a loader where the API data needs to be shown.
In the API function, we pass some sort of &quot;call back&quot; function that replaces loader with actual data, so once the response is received from API
It calls the callback function with the data and, then our callback function replaces the loader.
Let&#x27;s see this in action:

                    <span>In this short article, we are going to see how we can handle error in JavaScript in Golang style.
I am assuming, you have some experience with JavaScript and you are aware of the issues with error handling like throwing an exception to the parent method from try-catch block or chaining multiple then-blocks and implementing logic inside it. These things can easily mess up with the code making it difficult to read.
Golang avoids these type of problems by handling errors/exceptions atomically.
result, err :&#x3D; methodCall()
if err !&#x3D; nil {
  // handle error
}
// do something with the result

We can use a similar pattern in JavaScript with the help of a try-catch block like this.
const getData &#x3D; async () &#x3D;&gt; {
  try {
    const result &#x3D; await methodCall();
    return [result, null];
  } catch(error) {
    return [null, error];
  }
}

If any error occurs, we are returning the error in the second position of the array and the result as null in the first position.
If there is no error, we are returning the result in the first position and error as null in the second position.
Now we can call the getData method then handle the result and error like this.
const [result, error] &#x3D; await getData();
if (error !&#x3D;&#x3D; null) {
  // handle the error
}
// do something with the result

This pattern of error handling makes it very easy to read and understand the code.
Let me know what do you think about this pattern.

So decided to make a project by myself to remove that doubt from my heart. But now I am not able to decide on what project I can work on. So I am here to get help from my fellas.

Customers should be able to text you, and you should acknowledge their messages and address their concerns. To do this, you can build a Node Expressjs application to receive and respond to incoming SMS messages on a Plivo phone number. In this post, we walk you through how to implement this.
Before you get started, you‚Äôll need:
  A Plivo account ‚Äî sign up for one for free if you don‚Äôt have one already.
  An SMS-enabled Plivo phone number as you want to receive incoming SMS messages. To search for and buy an available number, go to Phone Numbers &gt; Buy Numbers on the Plivo console.
  Expressjs and Plivo npm packages ‚Äî run npm i -S plivo express body-parser to install them.

Apple: WebKit Bugs Exploited to Hack Older iPhones


Earlier in this series, we covered the WebKit bug, as it seems, older iPhones are vulnerable. Therefore, you should update your device if your iPhone device is &quot;old&quot;.
Excerpt from the article:
The two WebKit bugs (CVE-2021-30761 and CVE-2021-30762) are memory corruption and use-after-free issues that Apple says were fixed with improved state management.

                    <span>When using Redux-connected components, there can be as many as¬†three sources of props:
  props passed from the parent component,
  props returned from mapStateToProps,

  props returned from mapDispatchToProps.
When used with TypeScript, all those¬†props need to have types. If it&#x27;s a stateful class-based component, the state needs to be typed as well. This is a lot of manual type declaration, which has to be also maintained in the future. Luckily, starting from the version 7.1.2 of¬†@types/react-redux package it&#x27;s possible to automatically infer types of connected props in the most cases. The way to do that is documented in the React Redux documentation, and in this post we&#x27;ll see the application on a concrete example.¬†

                    <span>Javascript is great but typescript, is (controversially) even better. It adds type safety to a dynamically typed language and provides some cool features like decorators.
Decorators vary for different programming challenges but the basic point is to wrap something in it and change it&#x27;s behaviour.
Although this feature is currently at stage 2 in javascript, the tc39 committee have been working on it since quite some time and they probably won&#x27;t drop it any time soon.
It‚Äôs not yet available in browsers or Node.js, but you can test it out by using compilers like Babel. Having said that, it‚Äôs not exactly a brand new thing; several programming languages, such as Python, Java, and C#, adopted this pattern before JavaScript.

                    <span>LightDM is a light display manager for Linux, which have lots of different greeters/themes to choose. One of these greeters is the previously known as lightdm webkit2 greeter, then named lightdm web greeter, a greeter that allows theming with web technologies like HTML and JavaScript.
Sadly, this greeter was abandoned as Antergos team didn‚Äôt have time to develop their distro. The latest version, 2.2.5 uses an outdated WebKit engine, which could cause some new web technologies to not work in the greeter. Also, the Debian package is not working, a shame.
Luckily, Antergos team were developing a 3.0.0 version, getting rid of WebKit and using the QtWebEngine, based on Chromium, with Python. So, I decided to update some things about this greeter based on this pre-release.
Whither is the ‚Äúnew‚Äù tool that 3.0.0 would be using, developed by Antergos, allows to create web applications in a similar way to Electron.js, but in Python.
So, I‚Äôm here to introduce a new pre-release. You can install it from the GitHub Repository. Though, you need to install the whither sdk to run it.
Command line arguments support, such as ‚Äî-help, ‚Äî-theme, ‚Äî-debug and others
Some fixes with the LightDM API, as power functions didn‚Äôt work
Man pages updated
Every local request is made through web-greeter:/ url scheme
WebKit no longer here. Replaced with Chromium
Some API changes. 2.2.5 deprecated functions and globals were removed
If you are using LightDM, I recommend you to use this greeter, try some themes and create your own!

                    <span>We all are asked to use visual studio code and other rich looking editors as a beginners text editor or an IDE but that makes a habit of a rich and pleasing interface of running and debugging programs, and that is the reason we don&#x27;t feel good to use command line or the terminal. Terminal or Command line are quite important to learn and are powerful as well.  
Vim is a text editor, not any text editor but a special and one of the fastest out there, if you use it wisely. Vim can be used in the terminal which means it can run terminal commands inside the editor interface. That makes it quite a great option to improve your terminal command skills and also for enhancing your Linux knowledge. You can run program files from vim itself just by a few keystrokes.

                    <span>I know in Windows, &quot;file extensions&quot;, the part of a file name after the final period in the file name, are more than just part of the file name, they also act as metadata to tell Windows what kind of file the document should be treated as, and what apps to open them in (i.e. what apps are associated with those file types).
However, I want to start moving to Linux (Ubuntu) which I installed on my PC a while back, so, I recently tried making a new file (&quot;extensionless&quot;), and I wanted to make it a different type, so I tested to see if that would work by testing by renaming it .go, so I could try to open it in VSCode like I normally would on WIndows.
I look up multiple searches, involving how to change the file extension (only getting results using command line), and eventually coming over to a horrifying S.O. answer that horrified me, it gave me the info that &quot;extensions&quot; (file types) are determined by header.
There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way in the &quot;Files&quot; file manager for Ubuntu to change the header type.

What I want is a program that can give me a simple GUI to edit the file type of a file so I can easily go between one or the other as needed/wanted.

                    <span>In security parlance, the term &quot;open ports&quot; are used to refer to a TCP or UDP port number that accepts packets. In contrast, closed ports reject connections and ignore all packets directed at them.
Three types of ports are:
Open Port: A port is open, and someone has left the door unlocked.
Closed Port: A closed port is a black hole that&#x27;s open to attack. Administrators should block ports at the firewall level, and this could be exploited if an attacker has compromised another system. This can cause problems for networks because they&#x27;ll have no way of knowing what kind of traffic will come in or out on these vulnerable holes across their firewalls
Filtered Port: Filtered Port: It&#x27;s no small feat to filter all requests. This is likely due to a filtering device, so be careful!

After completing the process, you can scan/enter the code in an Authenticator App.

A shell is an interface to the underlying operating system. It allows you to execute operations using text and commands, and it provides users with advanced features like being able to create scripts.
So, everytime you want to execute a command you need to type entire command, I think this is one messy thing we need to do each and every time. To boost productivity and to save time for our lazy squad we have something called Fish. So let&#x27;s see what is it all about.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Web fonts are often terrible for web performance and none of the font loading strategies are particularly effective to address that. Upcoming font options may finally deliver on the promise of making it easier to align fallback fonts to the final fonts.</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
