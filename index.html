                    <span>This is an evolution of my previous article. Let&#x27;s suppose you have the following requirement:
In a long page, wait for a specific HTML Element to appear, and only after its generation scroll to it.
It looks simple right? But imagine that this Element exibition could take some time, for instance, it could be a grid with some information provided from a web service, or some data from a slow SQL query. Nevertheless, there&#x27;s no reason to scroll before the data is already shown. So how can we do it? My goals are:
Create a button that will generate a grid at the bottom of a long page;
After the button is clicked, some mechanism is needed to simulate random time;
Scroll to the grid only after it was added to the page.
comment: The table to be scrolled is not added to the page by default. This is…</span>

I frequently hear that it&#x27;s hard to know what to test of an Angular component.
In this blog post, I want to share how I think that we can get the most value out of a test.
To accomplish this, I want to closely mimic a user that uses my application.
To help me writing these tests, I&#x27;m using the Angular Testing Library. When you&#x27;re using the Angular Testing Library, you only need the render method and the screen object to test the basics of your component. For interactions with the component, I&#x27;m also using userEvent from @testing-library/user-event.
Let&#x27;s take a look at the first test for a simple component called EntitiesComponent.

                    <span>You might want to make some changes to the frontend of BitClout but running a node is beyond your league ? Well, you are on the right place of the Internet then!
You can easily run the frontend of BitClout locally on your PC without running node by using some browser hacks :)
docs of BitClout, you will have to run your own node (aka backend) and identity service in order to run the frontend. 
Before you get started make sure you are using the latest version of NodeJS and NPM on your PC. Another prerequisite is to have git installed. The frontend of BitClout is made in AngularJS so you must have atleast some basic knowledge of what single page application is.
Fork and Clone the frontend repository.

The series is perfect to get started and cover multiple different scenarios in different Javascript frameworks and C#. In this post, I wanted to regroup the four videos related to .Net Blazor. I also added the GitHub links part of the references at to end.
How to create a web app in C# with Blazor &amp; Azure Static Web Apps


In this video, we start from scratch. We will build and deploy a brand new static website with .Net Blazor.

How to add a C# API to your Blazor web app


Now that you built your web app with C# and Blazor, what about adding a serverless C# API to it? Have a look!

How to secure your C# API with Azure Static Web Apps


Prevent unwanted users to access your C# API by configuring authentication and authorization in your Blazor Azure Static Web Apps.

I hope those videos will help you to get started. If you have questions and/or comments don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out (comments, DM, GitHub issues), it&#x27;s always a pleasure.
How CI/CD and preview branches work with Azure Static Web Apps


In this video, I wanted to show one of the great features of Azure Static Web App Learn: the creation of pre-production environments. Using the CI/CD workflow, you can preview your pull requests changes before it&#x27;s in production leveraging the automatic creation of pre-production environments!

                    <span>What is Docker?


Docker is a tool that allows developers to package applications and all their dependencies in a container (sandbox) and deploy and run the application on host operating system (Linux). 
A container is a discrete process that has been isolated from all other processes on the host machine. This is made possible by Kernel Namespaces and Cgroups. This decoupling allows applications to run consistently anywhere isolated from the rest of the applications. Containers run images, which contain everything required to run: application code, runtime environment, dependencies, scripts, etc. Containers run layers of stacked images (eg. a base linux image (mostly alpine due to its compact size), node image and application image on top). 
Note that docker containers do not run in their …</span>

                    <span>Software development is a complex process. And it’s constantly reimagined or repurposed with new features. Unlike the production industry or manufacturing industry, increasing the number of people/resources won’t increase the speed of software development proportionately. The reason being, no other engineering discipline uses Intellectual capital as much as software development. Software development is perhaps the most knowledge-intensive engineering branch. So how does one increase or optimize the speed of an engineering discipline which is more abstract than concrete?
Software development as an activity comprises people, processes, and technology. To increase the speed of development, the math is simple. Assuming everything else is normal, reduce the variables which drag the project down…</span>

                    <span>Hi I&#x27;m Waylon


I am currently a Masters&#x27;s candidate studying computer science at Colorado State University. After I completed my bachelor&#x27;s degree in Mathematics and Philosophy, I was employed as a cybersecurity intern by the academic computing and networking services at CSU. I quickly developed a deep passion for cybersecurity and computer science and decide to go back to school to learn more.
While studying for my master&#x27;s, I have been employed as a Junior Systems Administrator for the Computer Science department, managing over 600 Unix machines. This summer I am also working for Hedera Hashgraph as a developer advocate intern providing educational content on how to leverage the Hashgraph distributed network.
I love python, Linux, rust, and cryptography. If you share any of these interests, don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out. I look forward to sharing my technical experiences with all of you hear and learn from the community. Thanks for reading :)</span>

                    <span>Our headless CMS, Strapi requires node version &lt;&#x3D; 14.x.x and we had node version 15 installed in our development machine. So that brought a question to my mind, is there a way like python venv for node to install different versions in the same machine. After doing a quick investigation, I found nvm node version manager that lets you have different versions of node on the same machine and switching between them.
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash


or
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash


To verify installation run nvm --version
To list available versions, you can run
nvm ls-remote

To install specific version you can use nvm install VERSION for example
nvm install 12.18.4

You can use nvm use to switch to a specific version. For example
nvm use 12.18.4</span>

                    <span>At Fonoster, Inc, we want to help companies and individuals that wish to adopt Project Fonos(PF) as their Programmable Telecommunications solution. To help archive this goal, our team uses Cloud-Init for cloud instance initialization.
You can deploy PF to all major public cloud providers, private cloud infrastructure, and bare-metal installations with Cloud-Init.
In this tutorial, we will also use Multipass. 
Multipass is a Canonical project that offers a lightweight VM manager for Linux, Windows, and macOS. With Multipass, you can deploy Project Fonos on Ubuntu in a local environment in a single command. This deployment method is by far the fastest way to get started with PF.

                    <span>What is Prisma?


Prisma is one of the best database libraries I&#x27;ve ever used. In a nutshell, you write a schema, and Prisma can apply the changes to your database, and generate a Typescript client library custom-tailored to your databases.
For this example, I&#x27;ll use a simple blog app. It has a User table, and an Article table. Users can have many Articles, and each Article only has one author.
To install Prisma, run yarn add prisma -D.
In a folder called prisma at the root of your project, you can create a file called schema.prisma. This is where the descriptions (or &quot;schemas&quot;) of your tables will be stored.
Prisma uses this file to apply changes to the database, and generate a custom client for us.

You can ignore the migrations folder for now.
To specify where your database will be, you…</span>

The security hole was a prototype pollution bug – a type of vulnerability that allows attackers to exploit the rules of the JavaScript programming language and compromise applications in various ways.
JavaScript is prototype-based: when new objects are created, they carry over the properties and methods of the prototype “object”, which contains basic functionalities such as toString, constructor and hasOwnProperty.
Object-based inheritance gives JavaScript the flexibility and efficiency that web programmers have come to love – but it also makes it vulnerable to tampering.

                    <span>Have you ever wandered what is .map() function in Javascript? Then this tutorial is for you! Today we will look at how .map() works, and what does it do.
.map()


In Javascript, map function is a method used on arrays, it cycles through every element and executes a callback on each iteration. After finishing iterating through elements, it returns a newly constructed array, that has been constructed according to values returned by callback functions, ran in each iteration.
map() method takes in 2 parameters
Callback Function
ThisArg (Value to use as this, in callback function)




array.map(callback, thisArg);

As an argument, callback has 3 parameters
Current Element
Current Index
Current Array



array.map((element, index, array) &#x3D;&gt; {});

In today&#x27;s example, we aren&#x27;t going to be using Current Array and Index, we&#x27;ll stay on Current Element.
Let&#x27;s now look at how it works. Throughout each iteration, our callback function is execute, and returned by this very same function is an element which is pushed into an array that is returned to us at the end. Don&#x27;t worry, you don&#x27;t need to store array in anywhere through iterations, it is automatically stored in function memory. Let&#x27;s now look at examples of the .map()
EXAMPLE
const numberArray &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const newArray &#x3D; numberArray.map((x) &#x3D;&gt; x * 2)
//newArray is [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];

In the script above, as you can see, it make an array with all of the elements multiplied by 2, and then returns it to us. This is basically the whole functionality for .map().

Labels mean pretty much what they spell. Labels are used to identify a certain loop, and give developer the ability to conitnue or break the loop at will, which would either continue or stop the execution of the loop as you might have realized from the keywords.
Label syntax is fairly simple, only things you need to know are 2 keywords, and syntax
This, down here is an example of syntax
label:
  function

Now I will show you how to use continue and break in labels
let i &#x3D; 0;

label: 
for (i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; 1000000000; i ++) {
  if (i &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 6) {

So let&#x27;s get started.
Redis is an in-memory data store used as a database for storing data
Redis is used for caching purpose. So If your API data is not frequently changing then we can cache the previous API result data and on the next requests re-send the cached data from Redis
As you know some websites which show live score of matches like cricket match updates the data on the website after every fixed second. So If the user clicks on the refresh button or refreshes the page, the cached data is returned to avoid the unnecessary heavy load on the server.

In Javascript, reduce() method is used on arrays, it cycles through every element of an array, and for each it executes a function that you have provided in the method.
.reduce() has 2 parameters, which are:
1. Callback Function
2. Initial Accumulator Value




array.reduce(callbackFunction, initialValue)

Callback method has 4 parameters, which are:
1. Accumulator
2. Current Element
3. Index of Current Element
4. Array Method is Used on




array.reduce(() &#x3D;&gt; {accunulator, currentElement, index, array} &#x3D;&gt; {})

In todays example, we will not be using last 2 parameters, we will keep it to just Accumulator (we&#x27;ll call it a) and Current Element (we&#x27;ll call it b).
Throughout each iteration, returned value from callback function is added to the accumulator, which is stored until the end of the iteration and then returned as a single value.
EXAMPLE
const array &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4];

console.log(array.reduce((a, b) &#x3D;&gt; a + b))
// 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
//Logs out &quot;10&quot;

console.log(array.reduce((a, b) &#x3D;&gt; a + b, 10))
// 10 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
//Logs out &quot;20&quot;

As you can see above, we reduced an array by adding all of the values up into one, single number. If initial values is not provided, then array will take first element&#x27;s value, and start iteration from the index of 1. If array is empty, then it will throw a TypeError stating Reduce of empty array with no initial value. Although if array only has only one element, then it will return an element, without calling the callback function.

                    <span>Hi I&#x27;m Waylon


I am currently a Masters&#x27;s candidate studying computer science at Colorado State University. After I completed my bachelor&#x27;s degree in Mathematics and Philosophy, I was employed as a cybersecurity intern by the academic computing and networking services at CSU. I quickly developed a deep passion for cybersecurity and computer science and decide to go back to school to learn more.
While studying for my master&#x27;s, I have been employed as a Junior Systems Administrator for the Computer Science department, managing over 600 Unix machines. This summer I am also working for Hedera Hashgraph as a developer advocate intern providing educational content on how to leverage the Hashgraph distributed network.
I love python, Linux, rust, and cryptography. If you share any of these interests, don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out. I look forward to sharing my technical experiences with all of you hear and learn from the community. Thanks for reading :)</span>

                    <span>Ok, I&#x27;m gonna try and surf the wave of publicity resulting from Dan Abramov&#x27;s recent post and its discussions. 
Let me address the elephant in the room too. Or talk about how I&#x27;m working to address it.
I&#x27;ve encountered the npm audit fatigue just days after the audit feature was released. It was on a Node.js project. (ok, 20+ of them at once) 
It resulted with the first version of npm-audit-resolver
If you want to know how npm-audit-resolver came to life, I&#x27;ve told the story in this recording:

                    <span>What if we have control over the JavaScript of another website? Let your imagination run wild on this one! What could be the possibilities in this case?
We know that JavaScript has access to the HTML documents via the DOM API&#x27;s which are provided by the browser itself. This means we can manipulate the DOM and make it look different, like changing the styling or the HTML structure of the page or we can read some cookies using document.cookie and send it over to your website via Ajax request or form submission or some other way.
But I think you get the idea that I am trying to convey here, having access to JavaScript on another website in a different user&#x27;s context can be very problematic.
Now the question is can we really inject some JavaScript into another web page? Well, the answer is yes…</span>

                    <span>Over the last month, I&#x27;ve been underground working on a project that I call Crow Authentication or, lovingly, Crow. It spawned when I set about creating a new application for myself that needed basic authentication. I had already implemented authentication in a previous project of mine so I had the nuts and bolts. As I was about to start copying and pasting code from one project into another a much better idea entered my head. I was going to create a service for myself that handled authentication for all of my projects. That naturally spiraled into creating a service and offering it to anyone. I wanted Crow to be Software as a Service, and this was my first venture into writing an application that offered itself up as a service like this.

                    <span>Rails 7 will be introducing a very cool new feature for ActiveRecord - application-level encryption, summoned by the mighty encrypts declaration in a model. This new feature provides a layer of encryption that sits between our application code and the database. In essence, when our data using Active Record Encryption has been loaded into an AR object, it will be unencrypted, and when it is sitting in the database it will be encrypted.
In this post, we will take a high-level look at how to use this functionality, discuss some cool things it can do, and acknowledge some of its limitations.
Before we dive in, I would be remiss if I didn&#x27;t point to the excellent documentation in the Rails guide.

Routing in react is like show and hide some components without reload page so the only part that loaded is the new part only using (virtual Dom), so the transforming between components smooth and easy.
In single page application one of the main concepts is to share data with all components that will use it, so we load it one time and use it many times.
Every time we access any page the application will call again all services that need to call to manage this page although it is called before among of this connecting with Keycloak to get new token even the first not expired

                    <span>One advantage of using React with TypeScript is that you can easily type the props of your (function) components. You don&#x27;t have to use React&#x27;s PropTypes because TypeScript already has its own typing system.
In the following, I will show you how to define custom props for a component in connection with already existing props like children.
PostPreview.tsx
import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;

export interface Props {
  title: string;
}

const PostPreview &#x3D; (props: Props) &#x3D;&gt; {
  return (
    
{props.title}
      {props.children}
    
  );
};

export default PostPreview;

As you can see, our PostPreview component has a title property. The component is supposed to render the title and other components (children) below the title. In technical terms this is called Containment.

I gave quite a thorough answer explaining how it works, and realized that it actually was a description vaguely resembling the synthesis of React and Angular. My dream was born at that moment!
Currently, when it comes to all existing frontend frameworks, those widely popular or not, I prefer React since it has a beautiful integration with the typescript. Using JSX as part of a language is really convenient. It offers a lightweight version with perfect compatibility (4 kB Preact instead of 30), with the possibility to inject it on the Webpack level without changes to your codebase.

What TypeScript is
Main pillars of TypeScript
Main features of TypeScript
Why you should use TypeScript
TypeScript basics to get you started
First, let&#x27;s address the elephant in the room.
TypeScript is a programming language built and maintained by Microsoft.

It is a superset of JavaScript that adds strong type checking and is compiled into plain JavaScript code.
Being a superset means that TypeScript has all the features of JavaScript as well as some additional features.

I frequently hear that it&#x27;s hard to know what to test of an Angular component.
In this blog post, I want to share how I think that we can get the most value out of a test.
To accomplish this, I want to closely mimic a user that uses my application.
To help me writing these tests, I&#x27;m using the Angular Testing Library. When you&#x27;re using the Angular Testing Library, you only need the render method and the screen object to test the basics of your component. For interactions with the component, I&#x27;m also using userEvent from @testing-library/user-event.
Let&#x27;s take a look at the first test for a simple component called EntitiesComponent.

                    <span>Adding code samples to your website is an excellent idea. It shows how the code should look like. It&#x27;s hard to image npm package docs without code samples.
Existing solutions are good when we want to show JavaScript code samples. But what, when we want to show TypeScript code, types alongside with code?
… Shiki Twoslash is the library you are looking for.
Shiki is a syntax highlighter. Is based on text mate grammar. The same technology that powers VS Code syntax highlighting.

Twoslash is a Shiki addon. It’s adding TypeScript compiler hints. Same as we can see in VS Code. You can check which
You can display typescript hints in two types.
Static:
const msg &#x3D; &quot;Hi world&quot; as const;
//    ^?


Dynamic:
ts twoslash
// Removes &#x27;readonly&#x27; attributes from a type&#x27;s properties
type CreateMutable &#x3D; {
  -readonly [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property];
};
type LockedAccount &#x3D; {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly name: string;
};
type UnlockedAccount &#x3D; CreateMutable;


Note: You need to attach JavaScript code to have interactive code hints.
Shiki Twoslash supports more functionalities:
mixing static with dynamic mode
showing typescript errors
vs code themes
Also, we come with plugins for the most popular tools: Eleventy, Docusaurus, Gatsby, and more.
You can read more about all options on shiki twoslash website.

                    <span>Coming from the Angular world back to Javascript can sometimes feel lackluster. The power of types is too much to resist. Lately, I&#x27;ve been playing around with React and Svelte. To be fair, I am liking Svelte a lot for a small single-page website. Combining these two was a must for me, So here is a post penning down the steps you will need to make your Svelte project run on TypeScript.
Clone the svelte repo to your directory with:
npx degit sveltejs/template your-project

Now change the current directory to your-project and run this command to convert your current JavaScript project to TypeScript, and install packages
cd your-project
node .\scripts\setupTypeScript.js
npm i

Install required packages by running the command:
npm i tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9

To add tailwind.config.js to your project:
npx tailwindcss init  tailwind.config.js

Head over to tailwind.config.js file and add this future property at bottom
future: {
    purgeLayersByDefault: true,
    removeDeprecatedGapUtilities: true,
},

To purge unnecessary classes in production modify purge property to:
purge: {
    content: [&quot;./src/**/*.svelte&quot;],
    enabled: isProduction, // disable purge in dev
},

You won&#x27;t want purging to be enabled in dev mode, to identify we can use the ROLLUP_WATCH flag.
const isProduction &#x3D; !process.env.ROLLUP_WATCH;

To enable tailwindss during dev and production builds update preprocess property to
preprocess: sveltePreprocess({
        sourceMap: !production,
        postcss: {
          plugins: [require(&quot;tailwindcss&quot;), require(&quot;autoprefixer&quot;)],
    },
}),

You can add this to your App.svelte or optionally this can also be done by creating a new svelte component and then importing it in App.svelte

  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;


Now you&#x27;re ready to rock🤘, run your Svelte project with:
npm run dev</span>

  Introduction


This article targets beginning to intermediate-level Angular developers and covers a wide variety of topics that arise in production applications. While centered around the concept of editing tabular data, these techniques may be used in a variety of other Angular applications.
For anyone who has read at least one of my articles, you should understand that my background is applied mathematics and scientific computing. So, this article continues the trend of exploring the use of Angular in scientific and business (analytics) applications.

So first thing we will discuss is how to convert the component to the Onpush strategy. Let say we have a Sample component and we are having a default change detection strategy(by default all newly created components are having default change detection), it will be like:
import { ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component, OnInit } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;

If you are trying to search and learn about hoisting, almost everywhere you will be seeing the same definition. May be that&#x27;s beginner friendly but definitely that&#x27;s not true. In JavaScript, Nothing will be moved.

                    <span>Data binding is the automatic synchronization of data between model and view. In Angular, we have 3 fundamental ways to make to-and-fro binding between view and source.
Source to View (one-way)
View to Source (one-way)
View to Source to View (two-way)
This refers to as Property binding method, it includes all following patterns to share data from source to view.
Interpolation refers to embedding expressions into markup text. By default Angular interpolation uses {{ and }} to encapsulates the expression.
{{title}}

 


Apart from element properties, we have element attributes ARIA and SVG for which we can use attribute bindings:
{{actionName}} with Aria

Single class binding
[class.sale]&#x3D;&quot;onSale&quot;

Multiple Class bindings
[class]&#x3D;&quot;&#x27;my-class-1 my-class-2 my-class-3&#x27;&quot;

Single style binding


Multiple styles binding


More specifically, we call this Custom Event binding, utilizing Angular Event Emitter. 
Consider the following code showing button which alerts on click. The alert content is passed through  component template using custom event showMessage():





  
  
  3. View to Source to View (two-way)


Angular two-way data binding is the combination of square brackets [] and parentheses (). [()] refers to property binding followed by event binding.

                    <span>O Manjaro é uma distro Linux baseada no Arch, mas que trás uma instalação muito mais facilitada do que seu irmão maior, a instalação foi feita no Manjaro Gnome, mas os comandos via terminal são todos iguais em qualquer uma das várias interfaces disponíveis para o Manjaro.
A escolha pelo Manjaro ao invés de uma distro mais popular se dá para mim principalmente pela presença do gerenciador de pacotes do Arch, o Pacman, e a possibilidade de acessar o enorme repositório do Arch, considerando o AUR e também a possibilidade de adicionar facilmente o suporte a Flatpack e Snap diretamente no gerenciador de pacotes Pamac, que possui uma GUI, basicamente se existe algo para Linux, então estará disponível para o Manjaro de forma facilitada por meio de algum dos repositórios citados, oficiais ou não. …</span>

This results in a real VM that can boot instantly, while using very limited resources. If done properly, slim can allow you to design and build immutable unikernels for running services, or build tiny and embedded development environments.
Slim currently supports Virtualbox, KVM, and hyperkit (MacOS only) as providers for running VMs. Slim will discover all available providers, defaulting to virtualbox, if more than one provider is available. The -p flag can be used to force Slim to use a specific provider.
You can find repo here
 / 
        slim
      
    
 

slim will build a micro-vm from a Dockerfile. Slim works by building and extracting a rootfs from a Dockerfile, and then merging that filesystem with a small minimal kernel that runs in RAM.
This results in a real VM that can boot instantly, while using very limited resources. If done properly, slim can allow you to design and build immutable unikernels for running services, or build tiny and embedded development environments.
Create a micro-vm from a Dockerfile. Use build command with a directory containing a Dockerfile.
$ slim build images/alpine3.8-simple



This will add a bootable iso in the slim registry. See example Dockerfile.
slim build will use your default provider unless the -p flag is specified (ie -p hyperkit).
See a list of micro-vm images on your machine.
$ slim images

It&#x27;s shocking because sometimes, you just cannot use them whether you have impairments or not.

Labels allow screen readers to voice the input prompt to the user. Unfortunately, many websites use placeholders only.
It&#x27;s a terrible practice as screen readers will try to guess things, for example, by taking texts that precede or follow, which might have nothing to do with the inputs.
Besides, placeholders disappear when the inputs are focused.
So don&#x27;t do that:


Instead, do something like this:

                    <span>JavaScript is a programming language with many useful features—it is built around flexibility, giving you all the capability necessary to do what you want with it. JavaScript’s dynamic nature allowed it to become the de facto language for the browser and the most popular programming language in the world.
One of the most useful JS features is, for example, immediate parsing. This feature means that the browser executes the code right as it downloads content, naturally providing benefits. However, with this level of freedom also comes responsibility.
In this article, weʼd like to delve into the JavaScript security risks and how to protect JavaScript code. This time we will cover only front-end code that runs on the browser, but we have another tutorial on protecting Node.js apps.

                    <span>React recap


Okay so I&#x27;ve written about jpex a few times, particularly in relation to react
Essentially it allows you to do something like this:
import { useResolve } from &#x27;react-jpex&#x27;;

const useMyDep &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
  const dep &#x3D; useResolve();
  return dep.someValue;
};

and this:
import { encase } from &#x27;react-jpex&#x27;;

const useMyDep &#x3D; encase((dep: IDep) &#x3D;&gt; () &#x3D;&gt; {
  return dep.someValue;
})

depending on your preferred flavour.
Jpex uses the service locator pattern to resolve and inject dependencies, plus it&#x27;s super-powered by Typescript inference for a super slick experience. But the really really cool thing about it is you can test your react components with the provider component to stub your dependencies:

Your understanding of the problem you are trying to solve, writing tests will prove that you understand the problem and the software requirements.
That your solution is actually doing what you built it to do? How else can you prove that? We can run it in the browser to check the result of our code but that&#x27;s only good for simple projects where you have a lot of time, and if you are mostly concerned with the look and design.

  Introduction


This article targets beginning to intermediate-level Angular developers and covers a wide variety of topics that arise in production applications. While centered around the concept of editing tabular data, these techniques may be used in a variety of other Angular applications.
For anyone who has read at least one of my articles, you should understand that my background is applied mathematics and scientific computing. So, this article continues the trend of exploring the use of Angular in scientific and business (analytics) applications.
Working with time-series data is a fundamental concept in numerous business and engineering sectors. In this context, f…</span>

                    <span>As I started building forms with React and JsonForms library, I found myself in the need of a custom layout for rendering array of items with eventually nested arrays, without all the whistles and bells of the default material-renderers. After some digging in the source code I was able to come out with a custom array layout with my personal style. I will share in this post how to structure your project in order build great custom JsonForms components.
let&#x27;s create a demo project for our needs. Open a terminal and type:
$ npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript

then install needed dependencies:

                    <span>Data binding is the automatic synchronization of data between model and view. In Angular, we have 3 fundamental ways to make to-and-fro binding between view and source.
Source to View (one-way)
View to Source (one-way)
View to Source to View (two-way)
This refers to as Property binding method, it includes all following patterns to share data from source to view.
Interpolation refers to embedding expressions into markup text. By default Angular interpolation uses {{ and }} to encapsulates the expression.
{{title}}

 


Apart from element properties, we have element attributes ARIA and SVG for which we can use attribute bindings:
{{actionName}} with Aria

Single class binding
[class.sale]&#x3D;&quot;onSale&quot;

Multiple Class bindings
[class]&#x3D;&quot;&#x27;my-class-1 my-class-2 my-class-3&#x27;&quot;

Single style binding


Multiple styles binding


More specifically, we call this Custom Event binding, utilizing Angular Event Emitter. 
Consider the following code showing button which alerts on click. The alert content is passed through  component template using custom event showMessage():





  
  
  3. View to Source to View (two-way)


Angular two-way data binding is the combination of square brackets [] and parentheses (). [()] refers to property binding followed by event binding.

                    <span>Now, We are ready to build our first Flutter AppImage app 🚀


Firstly , we will change our working directory to the project directory.
$ cd flutter_appimage

1- Create folder  AppDir
$ mkdir AppDir

2- Generate the YAML recipe file required to build the AppImage
$ appimage-builder --generate

this command will prompt some questions. Here is the final output :
INFO:Generator:Searching AppDir
? ID [Eg: com.example.app]: com.example.flutter_appimage
? Application Name: Flutter AppImage
? Icon: flutter_appimage_icon

? Arguments [Default: $@]: $@
? Version [Eg: 1.0.0]: latest

                    <span>Flutter is one of the fastest-growing cross-platform UI frameworks with a great and powerful community which has a great part of Flutter success.

Lately, Flutter announced desktop support including Linux which got the attention of big corporates like Canonical (Publisher of Ubuntu), and lately announced that they are rebuilding Ubuntu Desktop Installer using Flutter.
Flutter official docs also have a section on how to build and package Flutter Linux app in Snap (Linux Universal Package Manager) and ship it to Snap Store. here
So it will be interesting if we tried to package Flutter Apps using another universal package manager which is AppImage.
Linux OS (I will use Manjaro)


Flutter with Linux config enabled ( assuming you have latest flutter stable version )

                    <span>Vim and BASH?


Bash Scripting is a powerful skill to have as a programmer because we find Linux almost everywhere and to get through it you must have a command over its interface which is generally the BASH shell. Vim is a great option for doing this, or probably the best out there! Because Vim is pre-installed in almost every Linux distribution. This is not an in-depth setup for BASH on Vim, it is a simple editorial on starting up BASH scripting on the Vim editor. So without wasting time on &quot;Vim features&quot; let&#x27;s dive in with the setup for BASH in Vim.
Setting up a bash script doesn&#x27;t require much code but still in some cases it can be a bit hassle and to avoid the repetitive task, one can easily set up a macro for the boilerplate BASH script.

The goal here is to create a fully-functional forever-updateable system. So the two things that this is not:
it is not just a “live boot”;
this is not just something to then use to install Linux onto the internal hard drive of a computer.
Rather, this is Linux ready to plug into the USB port of any computer that can be told to boot from that. Every time you boot this system, it will inspect and deal with the hardware that it finds.
This way, the external USB drive becomes your &quot;system&quot;, and the computer is just the commodity used at the time. Depending on your use cases:

A Linux-based hardware RAID is hardly a good example of a reliable storage system – if one of the disks within the array gets disconnected, the whole RAID can’t be mounted, and all the information becomes inaccessible in a second. In this case, you will need a special utility to rebuild the array with the remaining (healthy) drives. It will find and display the data which is still there, and restore this information.
We will perform all the tests with Hetman RAID Recovery. Its main purpose is to search and restore information from inoperable drives…</span>

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>
