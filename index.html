Universal allows you to register redirects at server engine router level. e.g. @nguniversal/express-engine

                    <span>I recently had the honor of working with a neighbor beginning his development journey. He is taking a course through his employer and using a work computer with Windows installed.
Initially, I saw that he was using Git Bash ... mostly unsuccessfully. In particular, the Angular CLI was failing with command not found. He apparently had figured out some creative npx commands.
I wanted something simpler for him.
Knowing he had NodeJS installed, we set the path to the Angular CLI and made a custom shortcut to the NodeJS Command Prompt.
We followed the rabbit hole and found the Angular CLI in the following location ...
C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\@angular\cli

Then, we opened the Environment Variables and added this to the Path. This ensures that we are able to reference the CLI in the command prompt later.


Then, we located the NodeJS Command Prompt shortcut ...
C:\Program Files\nodejs

We then copied the shortcut and placed it on the desktop to make things a bit easier.
The biggest change we made to the shortcut was to set the &quot;Start In&quot; folder to the root of his projects folder ... we got to these settings by Right-Clicking and selecting Properties.

This simple setup gave him much more flexibility without any hassles for Angular development using the CLI.</span>

                    <span>What is Angular?


Angular is one type of framework that is used for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript.
Nowadays, Angular is the most preferable front-end framework. Mostly, it is used in developing web apps. To better understand angular, one must have knowledge about how browser work and the security of angular projects. Web Security is also important to protect a site from security attacks and data theft. Now, we talk about some important practices which help us avoid security vulnerabilities in our Angular project/application.
This blog will help you to understand how to build security into your feature development and become a better developer by gaining a higher understanding of the security concepts that are relevant ‚Ä¶</span>

 In React, you can pass props, or properties, to child components.
For example, let&#x27;s say you have an App component which renders a child component called Welcome which is a stateless functional component. You can pass Welcome a user property by writing





  


The property user is passed to the component Welcome. Since Welcome is a stateless functional component, it has access to this value like this.

Emergency Response Africa is a healthcare technology company that is changing how medical emergencies are managed in Africa.

The importance of securing access to resources from these client applications can&#x27;t be overstated. The wrong user having access to the wrong resources can cause a lot of problem.
In this post, I&#x27;ll discuss in detail how we handle Authorization to our internal APIs using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and how we determine the extent of the permissions to assign to the client making the request.
Authorization is the process of verifying the resources a client has access to. While often used interchangeably with authentication, authorization represents a fundamentally different function. To learn more, read this post on Authentication and Authorization by Aut‚Ä¶</span>

C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\@angular\cli

Then, we opened the Environment Variables and added this to the Path. This ensures that we are able to reference the CLI in the command prompt later.


Then, we located the NodeJS Command Prompt shortcut ...
C:\Program Files\nodejs

We then copied the shortcut and placed it on the desktop to make things a bit easier.
The biggest change we made to the shortcut was to set the &quot;Start In&quot; folder to the root of his projects folder ... we got to these settings by Right-Clicking and selecting Properties.

This simple setup gave him much more flexibility without any hassles for Angular development using the CLI.</span>

Something that was not intuitive to me when I was getting into this software development world was how to build the software&#x27;s architecture. Sure, I understood how to write functions, and components but optimally organizing them was not something I learned alone.

By regular interactions with your clients through push notifications, it is possible to release timely updates and stay connected with them. So, let us discuss setting up an Apple push notification service (APN) with a Node.js application today.

                    <span>NodeJs Environment Variables


Environment variables in NodeJs are essential for setting configuration options as well as storing important values securely. NodeJs by default comes with some environment variables that describe various parts of the application and the infrastructure it is being run on.
These variables, along with any custom added ones are available inside the process.env object that can be accessed in any script file within the app.
The environment variables allow you to store API keys and other configuration secrets independently from your main codebase and separate from your git repository so they never get checked in anywhere. 
Being able to configure and consume these variables is essential in creating solid, production-ready NodeJs APIs for all applications.

With lots of frameworks to choose from, and all those strong opinions, it‚Äôs easy to feel a little lost. Comparing frameworks based on the features they list can be a headache, and features are only part of the picture.

You will see that the order of tasks will not change even after reloading.
Even after changing the order of tasks by drag &amp; drop, the drag &amp; drop order change is not saved when reloading.
When you do drag and drop, you need to operate the database on the backend side in addition to the frontend side.
Create a column called index_number in the table. Then, when the task is stored in the database, it will have the number index_number in addition to the id and content.
When adding the new data,

Frameworks like Express Js or Kao Js have made writing APIs a lot easier. Nonetheless, it is expedient that a developer knows how to write code from the ground up using the in-built module like os, fs, and so on. 
Import in-built module
Create a server
Listen to server
Routes
Reading Data
Content-Type and Status

ü•¶  Create a file app.js.

Import the fs and url modules


const fs &#x3D; require (&#x27;fs&#x27;);

const url &#x3D; require(&#x27;url&#x27;);

const http &#x3D; require(&#x27;http&#x27;);


ü•¶ Next, in the sample app.js we create a server.

const server &#x3D; http.createServer((req,res)&#x3D;&gt; {

    console.log(&#x27;puppies are friendly...&#x27;)

    res.end(&#x27;puppies are friendly...&#x27;);

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a broad term to describe how responsibility for some aspect of a system is lifted out of the custom code written by the end developer and into a framework. Martin Fowler describes a framework in terms of IoC:
Inversion of Control is a key part of what makes a framework different from a library. A library is essentially a set of functions that you can call, these days usually organized into classes. Each call does some work and returns control to the client.
A framework embodies some abstract design, with more behavior built-in. In order to use it, you need to insert your behavior into various places in the framework, either by subclassing or by plugging in your ow‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Application security challenges lie not only in the threats and application vulnerabilities themselves but also in the processes and approaches taken within the organization to manage application security. The following below points explain various challenges posed for application security:
Lack of security awareness
Sometimes, even experienced web application developers are overconfident about their coding practices and make big assumptions about the security provided by their programming frameworks and security protocols, resulting in poor programming and attracts hackers to find vulnerability in their application.
Lack of resources and experts
Rapidly growing zero-day vulnerabilities
Increasing functionalities in the application

DevSecOps is a set of practices and tools combining development, security and operations. It enables better application and infrastructure security by smoothly integrating it into existing DevOps security tools and processes. This means security issues are addressed before production, as they occur when they are easier and less costly to resolve.

Angular is one type of framework that is used for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript.
Nowadays, Angular is the most preferable front-end framework. Mostly, it is used in developing web apps. To better understand angular, one must have knowledge about how browser work and the security of angular projects. Web Security is also important to protect a site from security attacks and data theft. Now, we talk about some important practices which help us avoid security vulnerabilities in our Angular project/application.
This blog will help you to understand how to build security into your feature development and become a better developer by gaining a higher understanding of the security concepts that are relevant ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>As I was working on my latest project I wondered what was everyone‚Äôs experience in this category regarding in-house vs. off-the-shelf solutions.
As you most likely already know bots can have a negative impact on your website in a variety of ways:
Wasting server resources, thus slowing down response times for human visitors
Scraping the website content, which was made to be unique
Faking human-generated content (eg. customer reviews)
Performing various malicious action
Also, in the world of eCommerce bots are able to monitor prices, fake orders and monitor stock levels. 
So, if you‚Äôve been using an anti-bot solution, did you have it ‚Äútailor-made‚Äù or was it off-the-shelf? How satisfied are you with it? Were you able to measure if it was a good investment? How did you come to the conclusion that you should use one in the first place?

                    <span>World Wide Web has greatly facilitated access to digitally stored data. Content on the World Wide Web, on the other hand, has only been machine-readable, not fully machine-understandable. Because most information on the World Wide Web is given in natural language, the available documents can only be comprehended entirely by humans. The Semantic Web is built on the content-oriented description of digital documents using defined vocabularies to give machine-readable semantics. As a result, the Web of Links is transformed into a Web of Semantic Web. The classic Web 1.0 experienced an angular shift into Web 2.0, concentrating on categorization, intellectual capacity, and collective wisdom.

Pada tutorial ini kita akan belajar tentang bagaimana cara mengaktifkan GZIP di Nginx untuk mengkompres konten ataupun data, hal ini akan mengurangi ukuran konten yang dikirim ke pengunjung website sehingga proses penyajian konten menjadi lebih cepat, dan juga meningkatkan kinerja dari website tersebut.
Untuk dapat mengaktifkan kompresi GZIP di Nginx, Kamu membutuhkan modul dari Nginx yaitu ngx_http_gzip_module. Modul ini akan mengkompres semua respons HTTP (file) yang valid menggunakan metode GZIP. Modul ini berguna untuk mengurangi ukuran transfer data dan mempercepat halaman web untuk aset statis seperti JavaScript, file CSS, dan lainnya.

Data privacy and security is the priority of every software product and services. During developing any software product or services as a developer first thing we should have to keep in mind that the storage and fetching of data should be secured and protected. 
Understanding of Data Encryption

Encryption is the process of translating plain text data (plaintext) into something that appears to be random and meaningless (ciphertext). Decryption is the process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext.

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve ever used Array.filter to filter a list to certain type of items, you&#x27;ve probably been hit by TypeScript not realizing what type of items your list contains after filtering. To fix this, you can use user-defined type guards.
Let&#x27;s say we have content items of two type: Post and Image.
interface Post {
    text: string;
    title: string;
    date: Date;
}

interface Image {
    url: string;
    alt: string;
    date: Date;
}

We are going to store items of both types in a array.

type Content &#x3D; Post | Image;
const content: Content[] &#x3D; [
    {
        title: &quot;A post&quot;,

    {
        alt: &quot;A image&quot;,
        url: &quot;...&quot;,

There are two alternative methods to set up a refine application.
The recommended way is using the superplate tool. superplate&#x27;s CLI wizard will let you create and customize your application in seconds.
Alternatively, you may use the create-react-app tool to create an empty React application and then add refine module via npm.
I will use superplate-cli and select a Supabase. You can customize other options as you wish.

We should add our Supabase url and key in supabaseClient.tsx

                    <span>When reviewing software with which you have little experience, it&#x27;s pretty common to attempt to compare it to software you have used before. That can help you get a handle on the general ergonomics and decisions behind the two pieces of software in question. However, one thing that this approach is not particularly good at is comparing the new software in situ. You may have spent a good amount of time investigating, researching, and getting comfortable with the software you&#x27;re already using in the context of your particular use case, so much so, that it may even be the best solution available in that context.

                    <span>A while ago I had an idea for a feature which would show the most frequent visited pages upon a 404 (page not found) error. After I let it sit for a while, I realized that this might be possible by using the Google Analytics Data API (which I only discovered in research for this feature).
To follow along, you&#x27;ll need at least some knowledge about building a backend server (could be in any language or framework, but I used TypeScript in combination with NestJS) and some general API knowledge.
You&#x27;ll also need to integrate Google Analytics into your website, but you probably guessed that already. (I also won&#x27;t show that part here)
The code that I used to get the feature working, you can find in this repository. Feel free to fork or re-use in your own projects!

                    <span>Storybook and Angular components


Context : Angular 12, StoryBook 6.3.9
Hey, I started to use Storybook and I would Like to share my experience. Here‚Äôs the use case. I have a simple component which only use content projection:
@Component({
  selector: &quot;adr-label&quot;,
  template: &#x60;&#x60;,
})
_export class_ LabelComponent {}

Here‚Äôs the associated story:
_export default_ {
  title: &quot;atoms/forms/label&quot;,
  component: LabelComponent,
  decorators: [**componentWrapperDecorator** (LabelComponent)],
} _as Meta_;

_const_ BasicTemplate: _Story_ &#x3D; (args) &#x3D;&gt; ({
  moduleMetadata: { declarations: [InputDirective] },
  **template** : &#x60;{{ ngContent }}&#x60;,
  props: { ...args },
});

_export const_ Default &#x3D; BasicTemplate.bind({});
Default.args &#x3D; {
  **ngContent** : &quot;Un label&quot;,
};

The specificity here is to use a componentWrapperDecorator. It allows to wrap our component and to pass it some extras like in my case a text content.
You just have to define a template like in BasicTemplate to emulate the content projection and using it like an input.
In the Default args, I add an ngContent arg to set the content of my label. I choose this name ‚ÄúngContent‚Äù because it appears in the controls list and I find it consistent to let know that‚Äôs a content projection in this way.
You can see the result here:

                    <span>When you get used to the console, there are little reasons for you to leave it; you just work faster keeping your hands on the keyboard. However, there are some of my proyects that have large and complex folder structures, that I need to be navigating back and forth. The regular cd command was a bit slow for me, so I came up with this solution I wanted to share with you.

                    <span>Introduction


VIM is a text editor for writing code, where you navigate around the screen with the Keyboard instead of a Mouse.
VI which came about in 1976 by Bill Joy. It was later improved by Bram Mooleenar in 1991 with bunch of improvements and named VIM.
Why would you use VIM when we have modern IDEs? The answer is, when you write code, your fingers should be bound to keyboard all the time. Every time you touch mouse your work rate is interrupted.
Linux/MacOS: VIM comes preinstalled.
Windows: Download VIM, Download the installer and install it. 
Linux/MacOS: Type &quot;vim filename.txt&quot; in terminal (without quotations)
Windows: Open &quot;gVim8.1&quot; from desktop or search in start menu.
VIM has many modes, but these four are commonly used:

  A tip from the video: snippets.


For some reason I was very reluctant to make my own snippets. A mean I used build-in ones, or the ones that come with extensions, but I never made my own. Until recently I was using css modules and I got really tired typing import for my styles.
So I decided to give it a shot. Turns out even if it does not save you tons of time, I mean typing is like 1% of programming, it surely makes you feel better. So I guess my advice is if you get annoyed about typing something over and over, consider turning that thing into a snippet.
And here is that css modules snippet I was talking about for VS Code.
{
  &quot;Import css module&quot;: 
  {
    &quot;prefix&quot;: &quot;mcss&quot;,
    &quot;body&quot;: [
      &quot;import styles from ./$TM_FILENAME_BASE.module.css&#x27;&quot;
    ]
  }

                    <span>Intro


This time, I will try decorators.
As a result, I couldn&#x27;t do that in this time.
So I just tried using them in this time.
TypeScript ver.4.4.3
Webpack ver.5.56.0
webpack-cli ver.4.8.0
I think the decorators are special kinds of functions for classes and class members.
// Compile error: Decorators are not valid here
@message(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
export function funcSample() {
}

I can add decorators into classes, methods, properties, accessors, and paramters.
import { Sample } from &quot;./sample&quot;;

function init(): void {
    const s &#x3D; new Sample();
    s.userName &#x3D; &#x27;Masanori&#x27;;
    s.greet(&#x27;Hello!&#x27;);
}
init();

import { classDecorator, methodDecorator, methodDecoratorFactory } from &quot;./decoratorSample&quot;;

// Class decorators
@classDecorator
export class Sample
{
    private _userName &#x3D; &#x27;&#x27;;

We will start by creating a new angular application using ng new my-app command present in cli.
In this application we will have a toast module which will show toast on click of a button.

It doesn&#x27;t included basic Angular commands like creating component, module.
Let&#x27;s start then.
As a first use case we will include the toast module in the main app module.
The toast module has a component and a service which is used to create the message and can be called by outside module where its injected, in our use case its app module.

                    <span>Being proactive is essential for any application whether that concerns the API, the web or mobile application. You can capture errors as they happen, with zero involvement from application users. Then of course you can work to fix the error, contact end users or whatever might seem appropriate on each case.
As part of this article we examine how we can setup proactive monitoring using Angular 12 and Datadog, by following two different approaches. The implementation should be similar for React and Vue and of course this can be adjusted to use Sentry or any other Datadog alternative.
Datadog is mostly popular as a cloud and infrastructure monitoring but it can be also used as a centralized logging platform. Personally I find that you get better application insights when you combine infrastru‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
highcharts is a rich and interactive charts library based on SVG.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the application with the Angular base structure using the @angular/cli with the route file and the SCSS style format.
ng new angular-highcharts
? Would you like to add Angular routing? Yes
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? SCSS   [ https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss                ]

                    <span>The Problem


If you‚Äôre like me and run a home Linux server, you may wish to add some extra security in the form of a VPN connection to ensure traffic is encrypted. In my case, I use a Raspberry Pi to backup things like RAW images from my camera to an off-site location. The extra security gives me a little peace of mind, especially as the server generally uses a cellular connection.
I‚Äôve been using UFW to work as a killswitch and only allow traffic via the VPN connection, but one issue I&#x27;ve had is with my trusted VPN provider is that they regularly rotate IP addresses. UFW uses iptables under the hood, meaning it can only be configured to use IP addresses explicitly and not a domain name. This has left my backup machine without an internet connection fairly frequently.

You can use my referral you will get $100 free usage for 3 months.


And when we open the config file we will see these details.

Kubectl need to connect to the k8s master, we nees:
DNS/IP of the cluster
Authentication Credentials
which will found in kubeconfig.
I&#x27;m setting up in windows. So, will be using below reference.
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/
Download this Kubectl binary

Next Step, Move that Binary to C:\Binaries. If Binaries folder is not there, create one.

Create a Environment Variable to call this Binary.

Move the kubeconfig file to C:\Users\ .kube and name it as config ( removing .yml extension)

To Verify, run kubectl , it will work from any path.

For, linux and MacOS installation refer below link.
