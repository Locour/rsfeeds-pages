Why Docker?
The need for Docker arises from virtual machines on servers being used at large scales. Take a large business for example. For a business that uses hundreds of servers with a cluster of virtual machines for each of their platforms, maintaining these machines is a full-time job. Each server has to have an OS installed, it needs upgrades and patches from time to time, and then dependencies for the applications each machine uses also have to be installed. 
You can see why this quickly becomes very complex. Manually configuring these servers is not feasible, so …</span>

e também uma assinatura no Azure
Você pode criar uma conta no azure e consumir os créditos para teste, mas nesse artigo os recursos que irei consumir são gratuítos.
O Coaltime, aplicação fictícia que apresentei no artigo anterior, recebeu permissão para ser continuado e agora precisamos de mais agilidade de implantação devido a contínuas mudanças no código. Outra coisa é que decidimos implantar o aplicativo em um serviço Linux.
Faça download do Coaltime (não clone)

                    <span>💫 The &quot;magic glue&quot; that connects the view and the model, keeping them both in sync.
Angular Change Detection is one of the most complex topics in software engineering and obviously in Angular as it is relying on that a lot. It can definitely be compared to the &quot;magic glue&quot; that connects the view and the model, keeping them both in sync&quot;.
On a broader scale, it is a mechanism built into Angular that allows Angular to decide what actions can be performed when the state of the app changes. The good news is that most of the time, developers do not have to deal with change detection manually.
However, if you find yourself caught in a loop, the only way to simplify your journey is to follow specific strategies, for example OnPush and trigger change detection manually if you need to. 
There are four ways you can trigger change detection manually. Let’s look at them in detail:
tick() on ApplicationRef **that activates change detection for the entire application by staying consistent and respectful to the strategy component of the change detection.
detectChanges() on ChangeDetectorRef  runs change detection on a current component.
markForCheck() on ChangeDetectorRef controls change detection through the marked components where the OnPush strategy has been set.
run() on NgZone that allows you to execute a function inside the Angular zone. This function, and all asynchronous operations in that function, trigger change detection automatically at the correct time.
Here is a very handy tip, which can simplify your life.

                    <span>Abstract thinking facilities us in solving many problems and solving them efficiently. Ability to say A is like B, helps us cheaply export solutions developed in A to solve B. This further refines the abstract pattern and makes it more robust and reusable (evolution!).
To solve problems in astronomy ancient Greeks developed abstract patterns to study geometry of triangles, Trigonometry. Now trigonometry helps us in solving problems ranging from construction of buildings to measuring current in electrical circuits.
Abstraction in Programming:
One of the primary objectives of programming is to come up with a code to mimic a real world process as precisely as possible. More precision results in bug free code which preforms adequately in most of the circumstances encountered in the process.

In a long page, wait for a specific HTML Element to appear, and only after its generation scroll to it.
It looks simple right? But imagine that this Element exibition could take some time, for instance, it could be a grid with some information provided from a web service, or some data from a slow SQL query. Nevertheless, there&#x27;s no reason to scroll before the data is already shown. So how can we do it? My goals are:
Create a button that will generate a grid at the bottom of a long page;
After the button is clicked, some mechanism is needed to simulate random time;
Scroll to the grid only after it was added to the page.

Recently, I was asked to give a 15 minute introduction on Quality Strategy in DevOps for our upcoming &quot;Efficient DevOps with SAP&quot; course and I happily accepted. And then, to my horror of horrors, I realised that I needed to figure out what a Quality Strategy is and what makes it unique in a DevOps world.
Instead of trying to come up with a definition, I started considering what are some quality specific aspects within the CALMS framework that would help a DevOps transformation.
So, here are a few ideas on the Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement and Sharing aspects to consider that might improve the overall quality of a system, from idea to end user.

                    <span>What is Kustomize?


Kustomize is a tool used to customize Kubernetes objects in a template-free way. It provides several features that allow us to customize the application’s configuration.
We can use Kustomize in two ways: use the standalone version of Kustomize or use kubectl. Kustomize is a part of Kubectl since version 1.14.
Kustomize is easy to learn and use because the customization file is the same as the Kubernetes manifest. It is very handy when you work with Kubernetes. That makes the learning curve low.
One advantage of Kustomize is that it uses a kustomization.yaml file to customize Kubernetes manifests. That avoid us editing directly the manifests. So we can use the original manifests without needing Kustomize.
We will see above, the main features of Kustomize.

                    <span>In this article, we will start by looking at how webhooks work. Then, I will compare the process with other data sharing techniques used by modern architectures in order to pair each technique with the scenarios where you should use them.
After the comparisons comes the answer to the question that might be heaviest on your mind: When should I be using webhooks?
Webhook communication is achieved by sending an HTTP request from a source application to a destination application. When an event takes place in the source application, an HTTP request which might contain data relating to the event is triggered. This HTTP request is sent to the destination application&#x27;s endpoint. This is the endpoint, submitted by the destination application to the source application, where webhook requests are to …</span>

                    <span>In a previous article, we looked at the practice of debugging webhooks. We covered why it is important to debug our webhooks, why webhooks can be difficult to debug, how to know what to debug, and tools that can help make the debugging process easier. In this post, we will put the theory of debugging webhooks into practice by receiving webhooks locally from a Stripe account and debugging them using the Hookdeck CLI.
By the end of this exercise, you will be well equipped to debug webhooks in your development workflows.
In this tutorial, we will go through how to locally receive and debug Stripe webhooks. At the end of this guide, we will have a setup that receives Stripe webhooks locally and gives us visibility into the headers and payload of each webhook request.

Fostering a blameless culture can profoundly boost your organization in powerful ways, from employee retention to developer velocity and innovation. However, there’s an elephant in the room when we talk about blamelessness with executives: accountability. When things go wrong, people still need to get fired, right? 
In a discussion with Ajay Varia, former VPE of MasterClass and COO of Emeritus, he shared an example of a real incident and how he held space for a blameless resolution without sacrificing accountability.

RAID 0 disk arrays are known for relatively high data access time, and that’s why people choose to use them primarily because of the considerable boost in the speed of read and write operations. However, their reliability and fault-tolerance leave much to be desired. Even if one of the drives is out of order, all the data in such a disk array is going to be lost. Recovering the information from this array type is quite a challenge, but even then, all the data you may be able to extract will certainly be damaged.

There are a lot of moving parts and complexity in this process, but this post is about the first part: how Scribe is able to fetch the routes from your app.
In the Laravel version, this process is hella easy: just call Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route::getRoutes(), and you get an array of Route objects, with each object containing the route details, including the path, HTTP methods, and handler (controller/method).

I recently earned my GCP Professional Cloud Architect certification so I was pretty sure I would be using GCP in production. I decided that the easiest way to deploy and manage my apps in production would be to containerize them using Docker. If your not familiar with what a container is I highly recommend reading this overview on the docker site. TLDR; a container packages a software application and its dependencies so that it can execute across different environments without the need to pre-configure those environments.

Começamos acessando o nosso terminal(qualquer um que tenha como diretório a pasta que estamos modificando), damos um yarn init -y ou npm init -y para criarmos nosso package.json.
Quando estivermos com ele ja criado, vamos baixar o koa com yarn add koa --dev para dentro das nossas dependencias de desenvolvimento.
Feito isso, podemos pegar agora nosso arquivo index.js e digitar:




 const koa &#x3D; require(&#x27;koa&#x27;);
 const app &#x3D; koa();
 const port &#x3D; 3000;

 app.listen(port, () &#x3D;&gt; {
     console.log(&#x60;Servidor rodando na porta ${port}&#x60;)
});

Digitamos node index.js no nosso terminal. Se aparecer a mensagem que digitamos no console.log e nosso diretório sumir, é que estamos com o servidor local on-line. Caso você queira derrubar o servidor, basta segurar Ctrl + C, que o próprio terminal vai perguntar se você quer mesmo derrubar o server ou não.
Com isso, já podemos rodar o nosso servidor, porém é recomendável fazer uma configuração com um transpiler (babel-cli e o babel-presets-env) para rodarmos novas features do ES6 como import, export e etc...
Obrigado a todos que leram e espero ter ajudado alguém, qualquer coisa é só mandar um feedback!! Também estou aprendendo e gostaria muito de receber alguns :)</span>

                    <span>We all know that the application makes an API call to get data and display them. so let&#x27;s see how things work. I will keep it crisp.
Firstly, your application makes an HTTP request call to the Node server.
Now, the Node server gets the request function and makes a call to a remote server for the requested service.
Without waiting for the response message from the remote server, the node immediately returns a response. which indicates the request was sent successfully.
When Node receives an HTTP response message from the remote server, it calls the call back function that has been defined in the HTTP request function call.
This callback function returns an HTTP response message to the calling application,
Ok, now let&#x27;s see this in a real-time example.
Let&#x27;s consider you are hungry and order some food, ill leave the choices to you.
First, you will open the APP  to select our choices and place the order. (This is the HTTP request that the application makes to Node JS) 
Now the restaurant receives the order placed and forwards the order to their kitchen.
The restaurant would send an order accepted message to you, without waiting for the food to be actually prepared. (This is the immediate response node, which indicates the status of the request).
Finally, when the food preparation is done, a delivery executive will be assigned for the order. (The delivery executive is the call back function that you defined in the HTTP request).
This executive reaches out and delivers you food. (This is the HTT response message )
I hope, you got an high-level understanding of node calls are processed.
Thank you for being patient with me for my first post, if any beginner errors. I will improve myself in upcoming posts.</span>

If you&#x27;re looking into web-scraping with javascript, then I&#x27;ve got a great, simple project to start you off, because in this tutorial, I will be showing you guys how to scrape the latest Tesla stock prices using Node.js and puppeteer.
Let&#x27;s get started!
First of all, you will need to install puppeteer using &quot;npm i puppeteer&quot;. Now if you don&#x27;t have npm and node_modules setup, here&#x27;s a great tutorial on how to do so: https://www.sitepoint.com/npm-guide/.
After you&#x27;ve installed puppeteer, create a new javascript file and require puppeteer on the first line:
const puppeteer &#x3D; require(&#x27;puppeteer&#x27;);

Then create the async function in which we are going to write our main code:
const puppeteer &#x3D; require(&#x27;puppeteer&#x27;);

async function start() {

}
start();

Hey, welcome to the Dockerize series. Here, I will be discussing how to use docker with your applications during both development and production.
We&#x27;ll also use techniques like Builder pattern, multi stage builds to optimize our production builds.
This will serve as in introduction to upcoming articles where we&#x27;ll dockerize our React, Node, Go applications!

Docker is a software platform for building applications based on containers, which are small and lightweight execution environments.
It also helps to eliminate environment specific issues since you can replicate your production environment locally, which provides consistency across our teams.

                    <span>Cryptography is the backbone of distributed ledger technologies like blockchain and other consensus-oriented distributed networks. If you are interested in building decentralized applications, it&#x27;s essential to understand the wallet generation and transaction signing processes. Both of which rely heavily on underlying cryptographic protocols.
In addition to distributed networks, cryptography is a critical component of cybersecurity. With cybercrime on the rise and cyberattacks costing businesses an average of 2.3 Million dollars per malware attack source, it is increasingly important to have your cybersecurity up to par. With the proper use of cryptography, you could save your business big time by ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive information.

Then it hit me... why shouldn&#x27;t I create the next Facebook of password storage?
1. The app must have a generous free tier. I wanted a personal plan, where you can store your passwords safely across multiple devices without hassle.

                    <span>📜 With modern computers capable of testing millions of password combinations per second, securing your online accounts with only a password may not be sufficient anymore.



  
  
  
For the past 30 years or so, we’ve settled on using a password-username pair as a happy compromise between usability and security. You have some knowledge that no one else has, so it must be you who’s trying to log in.
Passwords, however, aren’t foolproof. People pick bad ones and even the good ones are at risk of being exploited (for example, by keyloggers). That’s why a second factor can be useful. On top of something you know, y_ou must also provide something you _have to be authenticated.
A server can use any of these three options to prove that you own the trusted device:

I am currently working on an application that uses the Stellar blockchain behind the scenes to open up access to capital to farmers in developing countries like Zimbabwe.
The purpose of the blockchain is to provide transparency from the moment the investor parts with their hard-earned money, to the time the farmer starts sharing profits with investors. By nature, blockchain is very complex and the average farmer can not be bothered to worry about setting up wallets, ensuring their keys are safely secured, and all the jargon that is associated with blockchain technologies.
It is essential that we hide the complexity from the end-users, and make their experiences as seamless as possible. Sort of how when we browse websites, we do not even t…</span>

Serverless architectures are cloud-based and service-based. This means that, instead of provisioning and managing their own servers, organizations buy cloud computing services such as the following:
Software as a Service, or SaaS, delivers centrally hosted and managed software on-demand to end-users over the internet (e.g, Slack, Jira, Salesforce, HubSpot, etc).


Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS, delivers resources such as networks, data storage, and computers which must be managed by the end-users and offers essential compute, storage and networking …</span>

The process of adding the latest update and switching from any of the previous versions (for example, Windows 8.1 or Windows 7) to the latest Windows 10 is supposed to be easy, with all your files saved seamlessly just where they belong. However, sometimes the new operating system may behave unpredictably, and your documents, photos, music or videos may disappear after installing the last update.
But even if it happened, there are still grounds for hope, because we have numerous methods to find and restore the missing files.

1. The app must have a generous free tier. I wanted a personal plan, where you can store your passwords safely across multiple devices without hassle.

                    <span>Topological sort is an ordering of the vertices of a directed acyclic graph, in a way that if there is an edge from a vertex A to B, then A comes before B. For example, let&#x27;s say there is a set of projects and some of them depend on other projects:

In this example project B and C depends on project A, and project D depends on projects B and C. Therefore, project A must be executed first, then projects B and C, and finally project D. Resulting in this order: [A, B, C, D] or [A, C, B, D].
Note that we start from node A because it doesn&#x27;t have dependencies and repeat it, that is after A is done, B and C haven&#x27;t dependencies anymore, so we can choose either one to be the next. That&#x27;s why this algorithm works only on acyclic graphs.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s take a look on a minimal webpack configuration needed to build typescript.
index.html loads the js from the default webpack output location



  
Webpack ts example
    

  


The demo code is in src/index.ts - a file that is loaded for the default entry point. The code is simple:
const element &#x3D; document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;);

element.innerHTML &#x3D; &quot;hello world!&quot;;

document.body.append(element);

For this to work, we need 2 configuration files. 
Webpack configuration goes to webpack.config.js:
module.exports &#x3D; {
  resolve: {
    extensions: [&quot;.ts&quot;, &quot;.js&quot;],
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.ts$/i,
        use: [&quot;ts-loader&quot;],
      },
    ],
  },
};

extensions: [&quot;.ts&quot;, &quot;.js&quot;] make webpack attempt to load ts when extension is missing, and makes it try TS before JS. Object added to module.rules[] sets ts-loader for all files that ends .ts.
The ts configuration is in tsconfig.json:
{
  &quot;include&quot;: [&quot;src/**/*&quot;]
}

All dependencies that we need to install:
$ npm install --save-dev webpack ts-loader typescript

This could work would without installing typescript explicitly - but it&#x27;s better idea to specify the dependency ourselves &amp; keep it simple to pin the version if ever we will want to it.
In this article we have seen to what&#x27;s the minimal webpack configuration to build ts files. If you want to play with the code, you can find the repo here:

        webpack-ts

                    <span>In this post, we are going from zero to running a small but nontrivial script that fetches comments from Hacker News in real time using Deno, a new runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript created by Ryan Dahl, the original creator of Node.js.
Oversimplifying, we can say that Deno is an alternative to Node.js.
More precisely, we can read the following description on Deno&#x27;s website:
Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust.
Let&#x27;s delve deeper into three key characteristics that distinguish Deno from Node.js:
Simple: as we will soon see, Deno is simple to install, being shipped as a single executable file; Deno is also simple to use for small and larger scripts thanks to its powerful CLI, modern features and standard library; fi…</span>

                    <span>Var is a great thing. It served people well all across the world for years. But its time has passed. No one likes it anymore and now we all know it can even cause serious problems. Luckily there’s a better solution and it’s been a while since it was released (June 2015!). Why then do people still use var?
Ok, this is not about football, as some of you probably may think. Of course it’s about JavaScript. I’m a React Native developer, right? It has to be about JS.
Let me take you to the point.
Yep, a replacement for var is obviously let and const. How is it different from this var everyone hates now? 
Scope of var is the whole body of the function it’s declared in. Not a tragedy. But when it’s declared outside of a function, the scope is global. Now this is bad news. It can lead you to some unexpected or even unpredictable stuff in your code.
Scope of let and const on the other hand is only a block. A block, means i.e. a function, but also if/else statement, for/while loops, switch/case statements and whatnot. Basically, it’s between the brackets {}. So this is much more reliable and much safer to use because it stays exactly where you declared it. It won’t go outside.
What’s more, const will make you sure the value of what you declared will not be changed in the future. How great is that?
To be honest, I don’t even remember the last time I have used var instead of let or const. I’m not sure of statistics, but it’s also less and less seen in existing legacy projects I work on. Of course var has its use cases, but there aren’t many of them and still, we can do better than that.
Ok, I won’t say more here. There have been a ton of blog posts written since let and const were first introduced, this one is more like a social experiment. I hope you already forgave me the clickbaitish title!</span>

                    <span>Deno is a JavaScript and TypeScript runtime build in Rust. It was created by Ryan Dahl, who is also the original creator of Node.js.
Eventually Deno might take over Node.js but at the moment, it&#x27;s not there yet. Node.js is too popular and is already used in many projects. It has a much bigger community and much more modules/packages available.
Deno does not provide a strong enough incentive for companies to decide to make the switch. At least not yet.
Performance-wise it is comparable to Node.js, another reason not to switch.
So why am I writing an article about it? And what does Deno have that Node.js doesn&#x27;t?
Well, I believe that if Ryan Dahl decided to build a new JS runtime, he must have had a good reason. He actually gave a talk about this.

                    <span>Astro is a brand new framework for building websites. To me, the big thing is that it allows you to build a site like you’re using a JavaScript framework (and you are), but the output is a zero-JavaScript static site. …

I frequently hear that it&#x27;s hard to know what to test of an Angular component.
In this blog post, I want to share how I think that we can get the most value out of a test.
To accomplish this, I want to closely mimic a user that uses my application.
To help me writing these tests, I&#x27;m using the Angular Testing Library. When you&#x27;re using the Angular Testing Library, you only need the render method and the screen object to test the basics of your component. For interactions with the component, I&#x27;m also using userEvent from @testing-library/user-event.
Let&#x27;s take a look at the first test for a simple component called EntitiesComponent.

You can easily run the frontend of BitClout locally on your PC without running node by using some browser hacks :)
docs of BitClout, you will have to run your own node (aka backend) and identity service in order to run the frontend. 
Before you get started make sure you are using the latest version of NodeJS and NPM on your PC. Another prerequisite is to have git installed. The frontend of BitClout is made in AngularJS so you must have atleast some basic knowledge of what single page application is.
Fork and Clone the frontend repository.

I am currently a Masters&#x27;s candidate studying computer science at Colorado State University. After I completed my bachelor&#x27;s degree in Mathematics and Philosophy, I was employed as a cybersecurity intern by the academic computing and networking services at CSU. I quickly developed a deep passion for cybersecurity and computer science and decide to go back to school to learn more.
While studying for my master&#x27;s, I have been employed as a Junior Systems Administrator for the Computer Science department, managing over 600 Unix machines. This summer I am also working for Hedera Hashgraph as a developer advocate intern providing educational content on how to leverage the Hashgraph distributed network.
I love python, Linux, rust, and cryptography. If you share any of these interests, don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out. I look forward to sharing my technical experiences with all of you hear and learn from the community. Thanks for reading :)</span>

                    <span>Our headless CMS, Strapi requires node version &lt;&#x3D; 14.x.x and we had node version 15 installed in our development machine. So that brought a question to my mind, is there a way like python venv for node to install different versions in the same machine. After doing a quick investigation, I found nvm node version manager that lets you have different versions of node on the same machine and switching between them.
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash


or
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash


To verify installation run nvm --version
To list available versions, you can run
nvm ls-remote

To install specific version you can use nvm install VERSION for example
nvm install 12.18.4

You can use nvm use to switch to a specific version. For example
nvm use 12.18.4</span>

In this tutorial, we will also use Multipass. 
Multipass is a Canonical project that offers a lightweight VM manager for Linux, Windows, and macOS. With Multipass, you can deploy Project Fonos on Ubuntu in a local environment in a single command. This deployment method is by far the fastest way to get started with PF.

I&#x27;ve encountered the npm audit fatigue just days after the audit feature was released. It was on a Node.js project. (ok, 20+ of them at once) 
It resulted with the first version of npm-audit-resolver

                    <span>What if we have control over the JavaScript of another website? Let your imagination run wild on this one! What could be the possibilities in this case?
We know that JavaScript has access to the HTML documents via the DOM API&#x27;s which are provided by the browser itself. This means we can manipulate the DOM and make it look different, like changing the styling or the HTML structure of the page or we can read some cookies using document.cookie and send it over to your website via Ajax request or form submission or some other way.
But I think you get the idea that I am trying to convey here, having access to JavaScript on another website in a different user&#x27;s context can be very problematic.
Now the question is can we really inject some JavaScript into another web page? Well, the answer is yes…</span>

Routing in react is like show and hide some components without reload page so the only part that loaded is the new part only using (virtual Dom), so the transforming between components smooth and easy.
In single page application one of the main concepts is to share data with all components that will use it, so we load it one time and use it many times.
Every time we access any page the application will call again all services that need to call to manage this page although it is called before among of this connecting with Keycloak to get new token even the first not expired

                    <span>One advantage of using React with TypeScript is that you can easily type the props of your (function) components. You don&#x27;t have to use React&#x27;s PropTypes because TypeScript already has its own typing system.
In the following, I will show you how to define custom props for a component in connection with already existing props like children.
PostPreview.tsx
import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;

export interface Props {
  heading: string;
}

const PostPreview &#x3D; (props: Props) &#x3D;&gt; {
  return (
    
{props.heading}
      {props.children}
    
  );
};

export default PostPreview;

As you can see, our PostPreview component has a heading property. The component is supposed to render the heading and other components (children) below the heading. In technical terms this is called Cont…</span>

                    <span>Some time ago during one of my interviews, a potential employer asked me to describe a perfect frontend framework in my wildest dreams. I gave quite a thorough answer explaining how it works, and realized that it actually was a description vaguely resembling the synthesis of React and Angular. My dream was born at that moment!
Currently, when it comes to all existing frontend frameworks, those widely popular or not, I prefer React since it has a beautiful integration with the typescript. Using JSX as part of a language is really convenient. It offers a lightweight version with perfect compatibility (4 kB Preact instead of 30), with the possibility to inject it on the Webpack level without changes to your codebase.

  Introduction


This article targets beginning to intermediate-level Angular developers and covers a wide variety of topics that arise in production applications. While centered around the concept of editing tabular data, these techniques may be used in a variety of other Angular applications.
For anyone who has read at least one of my articles, you should understand that my background is applied mathematics and scientific computing. So, this article continues the trend of exploring the use of Angular in scientific and business (analytics) applications.

Video &amp; Streaming don&#x27;t have to be complicated for the web anymore! in this tutorial we will build an Angular app using Amazon IVS &amp; Video.js in less than 15 minutes!!
Amazon IVS (Amazon Interactive Video Service) is a fully managed live streaming solution: simply stream to Amazon IVS, and the service does everything you need to make low-latency live video available to any viewer around the globe. Amazon IVS handles the ingestion, transcoding, packaging, and delivery of your live content, using the same battle-tested technology that powers Twitch.

So first thing we will discuss is how to convert the component to the Onpush strategy. Let say we have a Sample component and we are having a default change detection strategy(by default all newly created components are having default change detection), it will be like:
import { ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component, OnInit } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;

@Component({
  selector: &#x27;app-sample&#x27;,
  templateUrl: &#x27;./sample.component.html&#x27;,

})
export class SampleComponent implements OnInit {

This results in a real VM that can boot instantly, while using very limited resources. If done properly, slim can allow you to design and build immutable unikernels for running services, or build tiny and embedded development environments.
Slim currently supports Virtualbox, KVM, and hyperkit (MacOS only) as providers for running VMs. Slim will discover all available providers, defaulting to virtualbox, if more than one provider is available. The -p flag can be used to force Slim to use a specific provider.
You can find repo here
 / 
        slim
      
    
 

slim will build a micro-vm from a Dockerfile. Slim works by building and extracting a rootfs from a Dockerfile, and then merging that filesystem with a small minimal kernel that runs in RAM.
This results in a real VM that can boot instantly, while using very limited resources. If done properly, slim can allow you to design and build immutable unikernels for running services, or build tiny and embedded development environments.
Create a micro-vm from a Dockerfile. Use build command with a directory containing a Dockerfile.
$ slim build images/alpine3.8-simple



This will add a bootable iso in the slim registry. See example Dockerfile.
slim build will use your default provider unless the -p flag is specified (ie -p hyperkit).

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>
