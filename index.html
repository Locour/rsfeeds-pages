According to the 2020 edition of the IBM/Ponemon Institute Cost of a Data Breach Report, 80% of businesses polled report that customer personally identifiable information (PII) was compromised. At an average cost of $150 per record, this is the most costly data type in the report.  But all data breaches are expensive, both in terms of lost data and in the hit to an organization’s brand reputation.

Some of the notable features of HTTP/2 is as follows:

Here comes Git-flow. Git-flow is a git workflow you can use to streamline your use of version control for your whole application. In today's post, I'll go over the basics of Git-flow and how it can improve you…</span>

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.
A very basic Dockerfile will look like
# Use an existing docker image as a base
FROM alpine


# Download and install the dependency
RUN apk add --update redis


# Tell the image what to do when it starts as a container
CMD ["redis-server"]

It generally have 3 steps :

                      <span>Terraform relies heavily on the concept of providers, a base brick which consists of Go plugins enabling the communication with an API.
Each provider gives access to one or more resource types, and these resources then manage objects on the target API.
Most of the time, a provider's configuration is static, e.g.
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

However, in some cases, it is useful to configure a provider dynamically, using the attribute values from other resources as input for the provider's confi…</span>

                      <span>HTTP/2 is the newest version of the wildly popular Hyper Text Transport Protocol. Based on Google's experimental SPDY protocol, HTTP/2 provides better performance by introducing features like full request and response multiplexing, better compression of header fields, server push and request prioritization.
Some of the notable features of HTTP/2 is as follows:
Binary Protocol - While HTTP/1.x was a text based protocol, HTTP/2 is a binary protocol resulting in less error during data transfer process.

A good example of this is setTimeout. It's a function that takes another function as argument which will be

We are now going to look at Terrascan as our analyses tool and have it running from CI/CD platform Azure DevOps which will also host the Terraform code we want to review.
To follow with the post in configuring this setup, you will need the above mentioned tools with permissions on Azure DevOps to be able to create a Pipeline, add extensions from a marketplace and commit to a repository.

PRIVACY AND DATA CONTROL:

It seems to me that the biggest Flaw that many people point to on Windows 10 is Privacy and Data control and also the forced updates, especially combined with poor quality control on those updates. You probably have heard that windows 10 "spy" on you and collects all sorts of information. Even if its a rumor but it will affect us.

how to add the port 8080/tcp in my system and list all the active ports in a text file called "zones.txt". I use a Linux Mint 20.1 XFCE system and I came across the apt-package named Uncomplicated Firewall. This package allows you to open ports on your system and makes them ready for use using ssh. 
Here is a screenshot on how to progress with the procedures.

I am also attaching my GitHub gist which provides an detailed explanation on how to implement this in your system.

We need to know how to start using TypeScript in our JavaScript project. In examples of this post series, I will use mostly code that written in Node environment. It won't be any specific code that is understandable for only developers who worked with Node before. Because this material is about TypeScript I want to specify more on TypeScript itself.
