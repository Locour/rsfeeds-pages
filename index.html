                    <span>Last month I setup my blog with Angular Universal (Server Side Render) this is about my steps installing SSR in my blog, so keep in mind a simple blog with only text with http request to contentful, so is real scenario, but the simple case to get start with Angular and Server Side render.
First step install Angular universal.
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine@next

Next step was set up the build in netlify
npm run build:ssr

The page is ready with server side render, but my client application need to request the articles, The TransferState service help to send information from the server to the client.
  imports: [
    BlogHeaderModule,
    BrowserModule,
    InfrastructureModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    BrowserModule.withServerTransition({ appId: &#x27;dw&#x27; }),
    TransferHttpCacheModule
  ],

Install it as part of the App module and import into  ServerTransferStateModule in server module.
@NgModule({
  imports: [AppModule, ServerModule, ServerTransferStateModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})

Done
Because my app is only text was easy to get more than 95% but keep in mind the following points.
Not all application are the same, my case is a simple blog, so not issues with images, or authentication.
Use https://contrastchecker.com/ and https://alex-page.github.io/sass-a11ycolor for accesibility issues.
If is your first time, try with an easy proyect like a blog or small app.
Take care about how to use or transfer data between components, I got an issue to send data using this.location.getState().

                    <span>A user is usually authenticated by entering a username, email address, and/or password and then being given access to various resources or services. By its very existence, authentication relies on maintaining the user&#x27;s state. This seems to go against HTTP&#x27;s fundamental property of being a stateless protocol.  
Your Angular app will communicate with a backend that generates tokens. The Angular app can then send the token to the backend as an Authorization header to show they&#x27;re authenticated. The JWT should be checked by the backend, and access should be granted based on its validity.

                    <span>Introduction


In this article, we will see some of the best practices to unsubscribe from subscriptions (aka Observables) and how to keep our code clean and nicely architectured avoiding memory leaks.
In a nutshell, we will use:
the async Angular build-in pipe
RxJS operators (e.g takeUntil)
custom array of subscriptions
the SubSink npm package
the @ngneat/until-destroy npm package
If you have experience in Angular, you already know that RxJS is one of the most powerful packages. It uses the concept of Observables to handle and work with asynchronous and event-based code. More specifically, Observable is an entity that emits multiple data values over time and asynchronously.
It sounds cool, right? Yes, it is cool and powerful, but you already know that!

                    <span>In Angular you have some great internationalisation (i18n) out of the box, which builds the nice compiled and minified bundle your used to. You have a compiled version per language. If you work with another framework which does the same thing (export a language per directory), this approach will work for you as well.
My problem: the separate directories give you nasty URL&#x27;s, something like whatwhat.app/en/. Okay, so that&#x27;s just looks but it can also be a problem with sharing links. For example when user A shares a link with user B, but they have different native languages it will be annoying that the opened link does not have the language correct language for the receiver.
In my case I wanted to make it a setting that the user can adjust, with a default language as a fallback. Easy to make…</span>

I frequently hear this question being asked by DevOps, Platform Engineering, and Development teams. Of course, this is a discussion that brings very different views from different people and can result in a very long debate.
Kubernetes, without a doubt, provides far more functionality than the average developer needs. While Kubernetes is robust and provides dozens of types of objects (around 50 the last time I checked), developers don’t care how many replicas of their service are running, what roles it has, or if it’s running via StatefulSets; all they care about is getting an HTTPS endpoint that they can use to deliver their …</span>

At the most basic level, an API acts as a door into a software program, allowing it to interact with other programs without the need for the developer to share its entire code.

Spurwing API is a secure and feature-rich, accessible platform for building integrations using their open-source widgets or even creating your own from scratch.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s Return the factorial of the provided integer.
If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: 5! &#x3D; 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 &#x3D; 120
Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function.
function factorialize(num) {
let result &#x3D; 1;
for (let i &#x3D; 1; i &lt;&#x3D; num; i++) {
result *&#x3D; i; // &lt;--basically going to accumulate all of the numbers.
}
return result; //&lt;-- returns 120;
}

console.log(factorialize(5));

The for loop starts at 1 and increments each time until i is less than or equal to num which in this case is 5. When we console.log(i) we get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 
I also created a variable result which is equal to 1 because if we put 0 there then every time we multiply it by 0 we get zero. the result variable is basically going to accumulate all of the numbers. We follow that by result &#x3D; result times i or just result times equal i which then returns that which in this case is 120;
function factorialize(num) {
  if (num &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return num * factorialize(num - 1);
  }
 }

// factorialize(5);

Notice at the first line we have the terminal condition, i.e a condition to check the end of the recursion. If num &#x3D;&#x3D; 0, then we return 1, i.e. effectively ending the recursion and informing the stack to propagate this value to the upper levels. If we do not have this condition, the recursion would go on until the stack space gets consumed, thereby resulting in a Stack Overflow</span>

                    <span>Let&#x27;s Reverse the provided string.
You may need to turn the string into an array before you can reverse it.
Your result must be a string.




function reverseString(str) {
 return str;
}

reverseString(&quot;hello&quot;);

Answer:




function reverseString(str) {
  let strArr &#x3D; str.split(&quot;&quot;);
  let reverseStrArr &#x3D; strArr.reverse();
  let reverseStr &#x3D; reverseStrArr.join(&quot;&quot;);
  return reverseStr;
}

reverseString(&quot;hello&quot;);

Our goal is to take the input, str, and return it in reverse. Our first step is to split the string by characters using split(&quot;&quot;). Notice that we don’t leave anything in between the single quotes, this tells the function to split the string by each character.
Using the split() function will turn our string into an array of characters, keep that in mind as we move forward.
Next we chain the reverse() function, which takes our array of characters and reverses them.
Finally, we chain join(&quot;&quot;) to put our characters back together into a string. Notice once again that we left no spaces in the argument for join, this makes sure that the array of characters is joined back together by each character.
function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split(&quot;&quot;).reverse().join(&quot;&quot;);
};

just simply return it.</span>

You are given a variable celsius representing a temperature in Celsius. Use the variable fahrenheit already defined and assign it the Fahrenheit temperature equivalent to the given Celsius temperature. Use the algorithm mentioned above to help convert the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit.




function convertToF(celsius) {

convertToF(30);

Answer:





function convertToF(celsius) {
  let fahrenheit &#x3D; celsius * (9 / 5) + 32;
 return fahrenheit;
}

convertToF(30);

convertToF(30) should return a value of 86</span>

                    <span>What is the Client-Server Model?
⦁ In order to build database-backed web applications, we first need to understand how servers, clients, and databases interact.
⦁ A server is a centralized program that communicates over a network (such as the Internet) to serve clients.
⦁ And a client is a program (like the web browser on your computer) that can request data from a server.
⦁ When you go to a web page in your browser, your browser (the client) makes a request to the server—which then returns the data for that page.
Relational Database Clients : 
⦁ A database client is any program that sends requests to a database.
⦁ In some cases, the database client is a web-server! When your browser makes a request, the web server acts as a server (fulfilling that request)
⦁ But when the web server requests data from the database, 
It is acting as a client to that database—and the database is the server (because it is fulfilling the request).
Servers, Clients, Hosts :
⦁ In a Client-Server Model, a server serves many clients.
⦁ The Client can be (Commands line Applications, Graphical users interfaces, Web App).
⦁ Servers and clients are programs that run on hosts.
⦁ The server sometimes refers to both the computer and the process that serves the web app
⦁ Hosts are computers connected over a network (like the internet!).
⦁ The host (computer) of the web server and the database, can be the same computer.
Requests and Responses :
⦁ A client sends a request to the server
⦁ The server&#x27;s job is to fulfill the request with a response it sends back to the client.
⦁ Requests and responses are served via a communication protocol, which sets up the expectations and rules for how the communication occurs between servers and clients.
Note:
Don&#x27;t let this confuse you. 
Since a web server can do both, it sometimes acts as a server and sometimes acts as a client :).</span>

App Engine provides us with two options: the Standard Environment and the Flexible Environment.
The Standard environment is a cloud-native option because it has a very fast spin-up engine that creates instances for our traffic in milliseconds.
The Flexible environment, on the other hand, is different due to its container-based environment that relies on Compute Engine VMs. This is important for many use cases as we can customize our server as per our usage and requirement. This can be the installation of custom packages like ImageMagick, MuPDF libraries, or SSH into our server or run our own bash script, etc. We can use any ty…</span>

                    <span>A temporary table in SQL Server, as the name suggests, is a database table that exists temporarily on the database server. A temporary table stores a subset of data from a normal table for a certain period of time.
Temporary tables are particularly useful when you have a large number of records in a table and you repeatedly need to interact with a small subset of those records. In such cases instead of filtering the data again and again to fetch the subset, you can filter the data once and store it in a temporary table. You can then execute your queries on that temporary table. Temporary tables are stored inside “tempdb” which is a system database. Let’s take a look at how you can use a temporary data in a simple scenario.

If you are not familiar with Argo Rollouts, it is a Kubernetes Controller that deploys applications on your cluster. It replaces the default rolling-update strategy of Kubernetes with more advanced deployment methods such as blue/green and canary deployments.
In addition, it supports integration with several metrics providers to automatically promote/roll back your deployment according to live metrics.
We have already covered some example scenarios in previous blog posts:
Blue/Green deployments with Smoke tests
Canary deployments with Prometheus

These days, we ask questions like what browsers will an application run in and does it support mobile platforms such as Android and iOS.
When we build the same application for several platforms, we encounter challenges that seem trivial for one platform, but become huge obstacles. These are issues such as: How do you manage translations? How do you maintain colors? What about image assets?

                    <span>I often found myself starting temporary containers to transfer data between the local file-system and container volumes. Or sometimes, between volumes. And the entire process was a bit tedious. Starting a temporary container, mounting the volume, mounting the local file-system, and finally transferring the data.
So I made a python script which would make this easy. I call it cvcp - container volume cp (copy). It actually does not use cp though. It uses rsync for the data transfer. So it&#x27;s necessary to have a container image with rsync installed.
You can find the script at https://github.com/jeet-parekh/cvcp. The repository also contains a Dockerfile which would build an image with rsync installed.

1. Linux comes in distributions 😁
Linux and related software come in distribution. A Linux distribution is an operating system, while Linux is the code that makes the operating system work (the kernel).
These distributions have a different user experience and target. Some distributions are very beginner orientated while others are oriented towards the power user. There are many different Linux distributions 
Some of the more popular Linux distributions are Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora and Suse. Each Linux distribution has a different target audience, such as Kali which is very security orientated.

When I started coding Expressive Tea almost two years ago, it was just a tool to increase my laziness (as most engineers) avoid setting up a project on ExpressJS. I was thinking about combining a language that I started to learn (Typescript) and making easier a configuration for ExpressJS; by that moment, I did not know about NestJS, a very mature and fantastic Framework. I did not have a chance to research, just because I got the idea to start working in this new (at that moment) personal library.
In September 2019, that personal library turned into a microframework to help build server-side applications in NodeJS and use modern Javascript powered by Typescript. Also, one of the main goals is to make this compatible with all the express middleware and plugins available when…</span>

This post assumes you are following along with the baseline project tutorial, but the concepts apply to any Typescript project.
User service


We now have a solid foundation for building an express server. Next, we will create a simple User service that will illustrate one possible architecture for implementing features in express. We are going to create a directory located at src/user that will contain all of the User-specific logic for our application:
src/

│  ├─ service.ts

This is my first attempt at writing a technical post. Hope you find it helpful.
Recently, I encountered a requirement where I had to extract all the zip files present inside a main zip file which had a random folder structure and any of the folders can have a zip file present inside it at any level.
Find Library for extracting
Extract the main zip file i.e demo.zip

Figure out a way to traverse the whole folder structure recursively
Then extract the .zip file whenever it is found.
extract-zip library used to extract the zip files.
It takes two input arguments source and target. 
source should be absolute path of the zip file, 
target is where the folder will get extracted.

Once logged into our account, in the services menu select the Lambda option.

It shows three different options, select &quot;Crear desde cero&quot; to create from scratch.

Inside the panel of the Lambda, go to the code section.
As we can see, the handler object is that returns the Lambda, so we must always export a handler.
exports.handler &#x3D; async (event) &#x3D;&gt; {
        // TODO implement
        const response &#x3D; {
                statusCode: 200,
                body: JSON.stringify(&#x27;Hello from Lambda!&#x27;),
        };
        return response;
};

Pass the function up, and down export the handler, in the end it&#x27;s the same but a little easier to understand. (The function is now assigned to the export handler).

There are way too many HTTP status codes. If you&#x27;re like me, you find it difficult to memorize these codes. Fortunately, we don&#x27;t usually use every HTTP status code out there. There are the common ones that people use often and we can limit our knowledge to just the ones we need.
It would have been great if we had only codes to remember but these codes have meanings (as far HTTP is concerned). So remembering the code only is not enough, we also have to remember what they mean and when to use them. The meanings given to these codes are standard meanings, so if we aim to develop APIs that follows the HTTP standard, it is imperative we use these codes appropriately else we end up creating APIs that others can&#x27;t understand or use.

Seja por: 
Polling(e tempos em tempos o navegador pergunta ao servidor se tem algo novo) 
WebSocket o queridinho(é um long polling, o cliente se conecta ao servidor e uma conexão fica aberta entre ambos, as vezes o cliente pede alguma info ao servidor) 
Tanto polling como websocket são bons e servem bem ao seus propósitos.
Polling, pedir informações de tempos em tempos custa banda e conexões do servidor. Se o número de clientes for pequeno, tudo bem!? E se o número for bizarramente grande? Se seu servidor não aguentar o número de conexões vai cair(senhor obvio).  
Websocket é ótimo, para um chat, onde cliente sempre ou quase sempre fala com o servidor. Eu creio que seja perfeito para chats e aplicações onde a comunicação constante entre clientes e servidore…</span>

                    <span>Atualizando documentos


No MongoDB temos diversos métodos que nos ajudam a atualizar nossos documentos, por exemplo: adicionar um novo campo ou removê-lo e até adicionar um novo item em uma array ou remover.
Nesse artigo, vou mostrar alguns dos métodos que mais utilizo para atualizar documentos juntamente com alguns operadores de atualização. Vamos usar como exemplo o documento abaixo:
Nosso Documento
{
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Emanuel&quot;,
    &quot;password&quot;: &quot;123456&quot;,
    &quot;email&quot;: &quot;emanuel@gmail.com&quot;
}

No MongoDB possuímos mais de 5 métodos que nos auxiliam na atualização de documentos, mas no nosso artigo iremos utilizar 2 em específico que são: updateOne e updateMany.
Ambos não retornam o documento, mas vou estar deixando o retorno para demonstração. Caso queira o retorno do documento utilize o método …</span>

                    <span>Como surgiu a ideia


Eu estava em minha última semana de férias do trabalho, já estava naquele momento em que você já fica com tédio de tanto tempo livre que tem. Foi então que resolvi revirar algumas anotações de ideias de pequenos projetos. Importante dizer aqui que, eu já trabalho com desenvolvimento web há quase 10 anos e já estudava sobre chatbots há um tempinho, porém sem ter colocado os conhecimentos em prática. Como no último ano eu trabalhei desenvolvendo integrações de empresas de frete em uma plataforma internacional de e-commerce, eu tinha muito claro na minha cabeça como funciona esse tipo de integração e as dificuldades de se rastrear uma compra feita na internet.
O problema

                    <span>Why is it essential for startups to hire a MERN stack developer?
• The whole web development cycle to back-end developing from front-end by using JavaScript falls under this.
• Facilitates MVC architecture for making the process of development flow seamlessly.
• It is imperative for MERN developers to be proficient in JSON and JavaScript.
• Open-source framework, which is backed by comprehensive community support.
• Facilitates using pre-built testing tools.
Conclusion
In the article mentioned above, we discussed MERN briefly and the reasons behind the popularity of MERN stack development. All these aspects help to make MERN a feasible technology candidate for any business at present.

                    <span>In this article, we will share several ideas on how to download files with Playwright. Automating file downloads can sometimes be confusing. You need to handle a download location, download multiple files simultaneously, support streaming, and even more. Unfortunately, not all the cases are well documented. Let&#x27;s go through several examples and take a deep dive into Playwright&#x27;s APIs used for file download.
The pretty typical case of a file download from the website is leading by the button click. By the fast Google&#x27;ing of the sample files storages I&#x27;ve found the following resource: https://file-examples.com/

                    <span>As video conference calls are now part of my daily life, I decided to investigate how I can look better in front of my webcam. After some research, I bought an Elgato Key Light Air to help illuminate my face better.
So far, I&#x27;m delighted with the purchase. The key light has definitely improved how I look on video calls. But having to turn it on every time I have a video call and then turn it off when the call ends is a pain.
I considered leaving the light on throughout the work day, but the light can be quite searing to my eyes when it&#x27;s shining at me for an extended period of time.
I then put on my software engineering hat and wondered, &quot;Can I automate this inconvenience away?&quot;. As it turns out, I can.
The Elgato Key Light and Key Light Air devices actually have a web server (listening on port 9123) built in. The web server exposes a REST API:
GET /elgato/lights

This endpoint returns the status of the key light.
Sample Response
{
    &quot;numberOfLights&quot;: 1,
    &quot;lights&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;on&quot;: 1,
            &quot;brightness&quot;: 9,
            &quot;temperature&quot;: 262
        }
    ]
}

For updating the key light, there&#x27;s a PUT action endpoint:
PUT /elgato/lights

Content-Type: &#x27;application/json&#x27;
--data-raw &#x27;{
  &quot;Lights&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;Temperature&quot;: 344,
      &quot;Brightness&quot;: 100,
      &quot;On&quot;: 1
    }
  ]
}&#x27;

This endpoint allows you to set the attributes of the key light. You can set the brightness and temperature, including turning it on or off.
This means that I can turn the Elgato Key Light off and on by interfacing with its REST API endpoints.
I created  a Node.js script that toggles on and off the Elgato Key Light. I then bound the execution of the script to a keyboard macro. So now, I can tap a key to turn the Key Light on and off. :D
It is relatively easy for one to interface with an Elgato Key Light or Key Light Air using its built-in REST API. You can even integrate it into your smart home via something like  Homebridge .</span>

If you are slightly into malware analysis you probably know about Intezer. One of the things I like the most about that tool is the ability of analyzing genes, meaning it compares already known malware strings and Libraries in order to determine if a sample is similar enough (considering the percentage of similarities).

  Intro 


Continuing on from my previous blog about website security week, we&#x27;re going to talk about Features and Permissions for websites.
These are set as headers on your site when it is served up.



The feature policy was introduced several years ago and allows you to limit the web features that your website and anything embedded including iframes can use.
This helps protect your users from anything running that shouldn&#x27;t be and accessing any web features that you didn&#x27;t intend.
Here are some of the most important features to enable/disable:
accelerometer
camera
geolocation
gyroscope
magnetometer

                    <span>Dear Coder,
Let’s talk about the person who matters the most in our field.
No, it’s not you (though you’re enduringly important to me, dear Coder).
I’m talking about the user.
I want the user to have a good user experience, so I build a model that inherits from AspNetCore’s IdentityUser. By doing this, I inherit a set of robust properties without having to write too much new code.
Let’s start with the User model:

In my ToonSpace project, I create a model named “ToonUser” and add some custom properties that IdentityUser doesn’t already cover, including:
FirstName
LastName
DisplayName
FullName
ImageData
ContentType

I also inherit the properties of IdentityUser by using the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity namespace and inheriting from Identity user when I name the class:

What properties does IdentityUser grant me access to? A lot.

With these properties appended to my ToonUser, I have the tools I need to allow users to register accounts and interact with my application.
In my data folder, I access my ApplicationDbContext file and inherit IdentityDbContext of type ToonUser.

Then I add the ToonUser to my Identity service, along with Default UI and DefaultTokenProviders.

Now I’m ready to scaffold Identity pages for user accounts. I add a Scaffolded Item in my Areas &gt; Identity folder and select “Identity.” 

I override all files and select ApplicationDbContext as my data context class. Once I add the scaffolded Identity pages, my Identity folder will be filled with boilerplate razor pages.

I access the code behind for the “register” view and add properties for First Name and Last Name because those properties are not the default with Identity pages. I also add fields to the View for the user to enter this information.

Now that I have registration pages scaffolded and augmented to fit my ToonUser model, users can register an account on my application.
I hope these letters find you well, dearest Coder.
Until next time, godspeed in your keystrokes.
Clickity Clacks,
Kasey</span>

                    <span>There’s a monumental cybersecurity shift happening in organizations across the country. Every day, companies are transforming their operations, adopting new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with technology to keep up in a highly competitive digital landscape. 
And with that change comes risk. 
There’s danger involved in dealing with data and peril in opening systems to the world. Access is risky too and everyday seems to bring more news of some kind of cyberattack. Implementing a cybersecurity program in your organization is an important first step in not only staying competitive but also combating cybersecurity threats, securing your organization’s data, and protecting profits.

                    <span>🔑 Biometrics are measurable human traits or characteristics that are often used in biometric authentication to verify a user’s identity for cybersecurity purposes.



  
  
  
Biometrics are measurable human traits, characteristics, or behaviors that can be used to verify a person&#x27;s identity. For example, a person&#x27;s face or fingerprints are unique to them and can be measured. So they&#x27;re often used to identify a person in law enforcement applications.
Biometrics have been used for identity verification since 1883 when French criminologist Alphonse Bertillon first used body measurements to identify repeat offenders. Today, biometric authentication is growing in popularity for enterprises because biometrics are an effective way to control access to sensitive information, devices, or physical locations.
However, biometrics aren&#x27;t impenetrable and come with increased privacy risks. So any organization seeking to utilize biometrics to verify employees or end users should pay close attention to how they implement biometric identification systems.
Below is what executives need to know about using biometrics for their organization.

                    <span>Summary


That short made me really troubled meanwhile😅
OS: OpenBSD 6.9
Web: OpenBSD httpd

App: PHP + PHP-FPM 
CMS: Drupal 9
I have installed Drupal 8/9 on OpenBSD several times.
Drupal admin panel has the function to look up &quot;Available update&quot; in &quot;Report&quot; pages.

Fig.1 Failed

  
  
  Solution


I found it was because of TLS connection failure, after struggling and being empowered by the official documentation:
Drupal - PHP OpenSSL requirements 
To fix it, place cacert.pem under chroot&#x27;s root and configure PHP aka php.ini.
First, get the certificate.
$ # /etc in &#x60;chroot&#x60; is &#x60;/var/www/etc&#x60; in actual
$ cd /var/www/etc

$ doas mkdir ssl
$ cd ssl

$ # get the cacert.pem
$ doas ftp https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem
$ doas chmod a-w cacert.pem

It looks like:
$ pwd
/var/www/etc/ssl
$ ls -l
total 448
-r--r--r--  1 root  daemon  206919 Apr 13 12:12 cacert.pem

Then, edit php.ini.
$ doas nvim /etc/php-7.4.ini

to add the line:
  [curl]
  ; A default value for the CURLOPT_CAINFO option. This is required to be an
  ; absolute path.   
  ;curl.cainfo &#x3D;
+ curl.cainfo &#x3D; &quot;/etc/ssl/cacert.pem&quot;

Finally, restart the PHP-FPM daemon.
$ doas rcctl restart php74_fpm

Happily, my site got the update information🙂

                    <span>Introduction


When I started coding Expressive Tea almost two years ago, it was just a tool to increase my laziness (as most engineers) avoid setting up a project on ExpressJS. I was thinking about combining a language that I started to learn (Typescript) and making easier a configuration for ExpressJS; by that moment, I did not know about NestJS, a very mature and fantastic Framework. I did not have a chance to research, just because I got the idea to start working in this new (at that moment) personal library.
In September 2019, that personal library turned into a microframework to help build server-side applications in NodeJS and use modern Javascript powered by Typescript. Also, one of the main goals is to make this compatible with all the express middleware and plugins available when…</span>

  The baseline project


This post assumes you are following along with the baseline project tutorial, but the concepts apply to any Typescript project.
User service


We now have a solid foundation for building an express server. Next, we will create a simple User service that will illustrate one possible architecture for implementing features in express. We are going to create a directory located at src/user that will contain all of the User-specific logic for our application:
src/
├─ user/
│  ├─ controller.ts
│  ├─ service.ts
│  ├─ repo.ts
│  ├─ types.ts
├─ util/
│  ├─ error.ts
│  ├─ load-config.ts
│  ├─ logger.ts
├─ app.ts
├─ config.ts
├─ index.ts

Let&#x27;s go ahead and create the src/usr directory and the files that we will be working with:

The goal of this tutorial is to write &quot;strong&quot; state management with 100% type inference from the javascript code.
Final example of the state management is available on github
or you can find a fully working example at the end of this article.
React introduced hooks about 2 years ago.
redux or mobx and we&#x27;ll still have nice minimalist code.
We were able to do the same even before the hooks were introduced,

Nueva is a component based UI library for making user interfaces. Many features are not implemented like reactivity updation, applying props. Just to name a few.
I would like you guys reading this check that out.
It is currently on v 0.0.2-alpha03 while writing this post.

                    <span>Question:
Quick answer:
Longer answer:
previous post, there are pure and impure functions. 
Pure functions are basically functions that return the same result if you pass the same data and they don&#x27;t change anything outside of its scope.
let pureAdd &#x3D; (a, b) &#x3D;&gt; a + b

This pureAdd function doesn&#x27;t change anything outside it just returns the answer and it always returns the same answer for the same arguments.
With these restrictions come the benefits. If the result is the same every time we run the functions, then why don&#x27;t we just calculate it once and save the result?
// Don&#x27;t reuse it, it is just an example
let memo &#x3D; (func) &#x3D;&gt; {
  let cache &#x3D; {}
  return (...args) &#x3D;&gt; {
    if (cache[args]) {
      console.log(&#x27;Cache hit :)&#x27;)
      return cache[args]
    }
    console.log(&#x27;Cache miss :(&#x27;)
    let result &#x3D; func(...args)
    cache[args] &#x3D; result
    return result
  }
}

function sleep(ms) {
  var start &#x3D; new Date().getTime(), expire &#x3D; start + ms;
  while (new Date().getTime()  {
  sleep(1000)
  return a + b
}

let memoAdd &#x3D; memo(slowAdd)
console.log(memoAdd(1, 2))
// * waiting for 1 sec *
// Cache miss :(
// 3
console.log(memoAdd(1, 2))
// No waiting
// Cache hit :)
// 3

Real-life applications:
For example, there is React.memo which does memoization.
If your component renders the same result given the same props ... React will skip rendering the component, and reuse the last rendered result.
Also, there is a useMemo hook, which also does memoization.
useMemo will only recompute the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed. This optimization helps to avoid expensive calculations on every render.

                    <span>Introduction


In this article, we will see some of the best practices to unsubscribe from subscriptions (aka Observables) and how to keep our code clean and nicely architectured avoiding memory leaks.
In a nutshell, we will use:
the async Angular build-in pipe
RxJS operators (e.g takeUntil)
custom array of subscriptions
the SubSink npm package
the @ngneat/until-destroy npm package
If you have experience in Angular, you already know that RxJS is one of the most powerful packages. It uses the concept of Observables to handle and work with asynchronous and event-based code. More specifically, Observable is an entity that emits multiple data values over time and asynchronously.
It sounds cool, right? Yes, it is cool and powerful, but you already know that!

Next.js is a super cool React framework, that gives you an amazing developer experience. In this episode, I&#x27;ll show you how to test the Next pages with few useful libraries. This setup will allow us to create integration tests with mocking calls to the API. You can check the working example here.
First of all, set up your Next app with Typescript and React Testing Library. I explained how to do it in one of the previous episodes.
When it&#x27;s done, install rest of the needed dependencies:
MSW - API mocking tool
Next Page Tester - DOM integration testing tool for Next.js
Axios - you can use any fetching library, but we will go with this one

TLDR @okikio/animate is basically animejs but built on the Web Animation API.
@okikio/animate is an animation library for the modern web. It was inspired by animate plus, and animejs; @okikio/animate is a Javascript animation library focused on performance and ease of use. It  utilizes the Web Animation API to deliver butter smooth animations at a small size, it weighs ~5.36 KB (minified and gzipped).

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

                    <span>Vim is a text editor with a huge following. It&#x27;s installed by  default on every Linux system and even on Mac OS X.
Vim is a tool that wants you to succeed. if you want something to happen, you can make it happen. It works completely by keyboard shortcuts. 

It gives you the power to manipulate text at a fundamental level. you can operate on individual characters, words or lines of text this gives vim a really powerful interactive feel.
If you are new to vim, I recommend these exercises
I am often connecting to remote machines and editing config files. 
This was cumbersome, as I would have to use SFTP to copy files, manually updating the buffer when the file was modified on the remote machine. 
It was too easy to get distracted and lose track of what I was doing.
If you want to edit files on a remote server, try this command:
vim scp://you@remote_ip//path/file.txt

and change username to your username, your remote ip, the path and the filename.
vim scp://frank@192.168.2.7//home/frank/hello.txt

If you have vim open, you can also do :e scp://you@remote_ip//path/file.txt
You can use sftp too:
vim sftp://user@remote_ip//path/file

Change it with your username, remote ip and path to the file.
vim sftp://frank@192.168.2.7//home/frank/hello.txt

If you want to use the old unencrypted ftp protocol
:e ftp://[user@]machine/path/

Vim is relentlessly awesome. It does everything an editor should do and nothing it shouldn&#x27;t. There are no gimmicks, no silly settings, no bloat. It just works. all the time. no exceptions.</span>

                    <span>Are you tired of scanning images and trying to shrink them under 25 mbs just so you can send them via email ? Look no further, I am here to save you from this trouble. (that kinda rhymed.)
This basic shell script uses ghostscript to compress your scanned pdfs significantly. Just yesterday I scanned 100 pages of documents and it was over 90 mbs. I searched for a way to compress them under 25 mbs and voila. Here I was with only 6 mbs of pdfs. Much wow. Such compression.
Why we need it,
Fast.
Ez.
No need to go online. Especially no need to upload company top-secret documents to any website you see on the Internet.
Possible huge compression without notable loss.
Command usage:
./shrinkpdf.sh in.pdf out.pdf
ghostscript.





If you are in a situation exactly like me where there are 100 pdf files under one folder that you want to compress altogether, a simple for loop will suffice.
import os
import subprocess
import sys

infolder &#x3D; sys.argv[1]
outfolder &#x3D; &quot;compressed_&quot; + infolder
os.mkdir(outfolder)

for f in os.listdir(infolder):
    subprocess.run([&quot;./shrinkpdf.sh&quot;, os.path.join(infolder, f), os.path.join(outfolder, f)])

Run this python script,
python shrink.py pdfs/
and all of your pdfs will be put under compressed_pdfs/.

                    <span>Introduction


Hey now, you have probably went through numerous job-hunting websites and you memorized all the buzzwords (Junior Sysadmin; Junior Site Reliability Engineer; NOC Engineer; System support; etc.) that can get you in IT with zero experience, or even zero education. Well, let me tell you - you are on the right track! However, there are some insights that a lot of you don&#x27;t know as you haven&#x27;t got a real Linux job. Well now, except you are on the right track, you are on the post, as well!
I am going to note down &amp; explain the top 10 Linux skills (in the opinion of a person who had a Linux job as a first) that you should have before rushing into the interview.
Linux skills? But I know a lot of commands already!

                    <span>The Linux command line is for power users. It is not for the faint of heart or for people who are afraid to take a risk. 
If you are new to Linux and are afraid to take the plunge into using the command line interface, then this tutorial is a good start. 
Linux is an open source operating system that is used on everything from smart phones to main frame computers. 
Linux provides a command line interface (CLI) that provides a quick and powerful way to control and manipulate your computer. Once mastered, the Linux CLI can save you time and provide a powerful tool to aid in your daily tasks.
The command line can be intimidating but learning the basics will give you access to a world of scripts and automation tools that will make your life a lot easier and more productive.
The Basics: You will be using the command line to type various commands and tasks. Commands are what Linux runs. In Linux, the Command Line can be used for various things.

To start, open up a terminal. Now, let&#x27;s try using some basic Linux commands! 
Most of these commands are applicable for all Linux distributions. Linux is case sensitive (capitalization matters).
Navigation
ls    List directory
cd DIR Change the current directory to the DIR directory
cd ~  Change to home directory
cd /      Change the current directory to the root directory
cd ..     Go one directory lower
pwd   Show name of current working directory 
File Commands
mkdir -p DIR Create directory DIR 
rm FILE Remove FILE
rm -r DIR Remove DIR and its contents recursively
rm -f FILE Force remove FILE 
System Info
date  Print or set the system date and time
cal   Displays a calendar
uptime Tell how long the system has been running
w     Show who is logged on and what they are doing
whoami  Print effective userid</span>

                    <span>Vim is the most famous text editor many programmers use for coding on the Linux terminal.
Vim is a text editor for Linux. Many people have grown up using Vim, that and its ubiquitous nature means it can be found on any Unix/Linux system. 
Many “power users” swear by the power and functionality of Vim, however many people see it as intimidating and complicated. If you are new to vim, I recommend these exercises
Vim can be downloaded and installed from a software repository. Vim is often installed by default on Linux systems and even on Mac OS X.
You can install vim with your package manager
sudo apt-get install vim

The reasons for this are simple: it&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s powerful, and it comes in both a terminal emulator and a GUI version. 
You can use it locally or over an ssh connection. It can even be used inside IDEs as a plugin.
Vim allows programmers to edit text quickly and efficiently. You can jump to the end of file using G, top of file using gg and to line 10 using 10G. Vim allows you to record and replay keystrokes and has many many more features.

Vim 8 comes with built-in support for Python, PHP, Perl, Ruby and Tcl programming languages.
Vim as a code editor but it&#x27;s much more powerful than you may think. Before you do anything else, you should know that:
Vim is not a text editor that uses a mouse. It&#x27;s a program that uses keyboard shortcuts to perform all of the tasks.
Vim is hard to learn. You will have to spend a lot of time practising and mastering your skills before using it effectively.</span>

                    <span>WhatsApp is an instant messaging application that Facebook owns. It is the third most used messaging application, according to Messenger People. Although it uses end-to-end encryption, it still collects more metadata on its users than other messaging applications like Signal. 
In January 2021, news circulated that WhatsApp planned to roll out in-app notifications to users, informing an update in its Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It was up to the user to accept the new WhatsApp Privacy Policy and Terms of Service to continue to use the messaging application.
The company tweaked its terms of service and privacy policy which notified users once they entered the application. Users had to accept these updates to continue to use the application, and these changes were scheduled to be implemented on February 8th, 2021. The following were the updates made in terms of service and privacy policy:
WhatsApp’s service and how we process your data
How businesses can use Facebook hosted services to store and 
manage their WhatsApp chats
How they partner with Facebook to offer integrations across the 
Facebook Company Products

                    <span>CSRF (cross-site request forgery) is a type of attack on a site that is carried out using a fraudulent site or a script that causes the user&#x27;s browser to perform an undesirable action on a trusted site where the user is logged in.
Usually, to do this, the user must click on a fraudulent link (which can be changed using a link shortener).
For example, Jane, who is logged in to the bank&#x27;s website, checks her email. They may click on a phishing link that includes a request to transfer money to the fraudster&#x27;s account.
Due to the fact that it is authorized on the bank&#x27;s website, the bank will process the transfer request.
The GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE methods are not subject to CSRF, because they are intended only for retrieving information and do not change the server state.

  The baseline project


This post assumes you are following along with the baseline project tutorial, but the concepts apply to any Typescript project.
As our codebase expands, so does the risk of introducing bugs and inconsistent styling. We are going to use two tools to help enforce some Typescript best practices and general code formatting guidelines:
ESLint
eslint is a linter, which is a static code analysis tools that can scan our codebase and throw errors and warnings if there are any issues in our codebase.
Prettier
prettier is an automatic code formatter that automatically formats our code with consistent styling.
We can manually run these tools to lint and format our codebase, but we are also going to enforce these rules by setting up git hooks - sc…</span>

Runtime Templates Using String Identifiers
Many of the applications I develop for clients most often involve mathematical sciences, ranging from physics and engineering to financial modeling to data analytics. These applications regularly employ components in which the majority of the component’s runtime display is driven by external data. We are all familiar with using binding to alter some portion of a component. A fully data-driven component will also have other aspects of its display controlled by external data.
For example, it is common in the utility industry to display, analyze, and even edit load profiles. Each profile contains one or more time series such as ‘raw data,’ ‘cleansed data’, ‘gross’, ‘AMI’, etc. Each of these series has some meaning t…</span>

                    <span>Schematics in Angular provide a way to automate common tasks, such as generating files, reading, and updating configuration files, and modifying your codebase. Angular Schematics are built using the Angular Devkit, which consists of many lower-level APIs, along with a few concepts to learn such as the Virtual Filesystem, Trees, Rules, Actions, Context and more. Learning these concepts and APIs can be challenging for developers looking to write schematics for Angular applications and libraries.
The Nx Devkit is an underlying part of the Nx build framework that provides utilities for building generators and executors.

                    <span>For the last couple of years, I have been in the Linux space and mostly tried to find the best distro, best file manager, best terminal etc. I was caught up in the loop of finding the best programs to handle a job. This approach, unless controlled, usually leads to low productivity in the long term.
How so you might ask ? Well, this behavior is really relatable for some people. When I am talking about this subject, some of you might probably say, &quot;Oh yes I have been there&quot;. In Linux world, there is even a term for this. Ricing.
Ricing means tweaking the configuration of your working environment to suit your personal needs. At particular level, one might consider this useful, and it indeed is. There are some workflow approaches, shortcuts and others that helps the developer access files and folders faster, learn by muscle memory and perform some set of actions quicker. Past that particular level and you are now in the over-ricing zone. Where you are essentially tweaking every aspect of each program, work environment to your needs, but at the same time you are never satisfied so you keep tweaking and changing settings, configs and what not. It reduces your productivity and at the end of the day when you look back, you realize you have done nothing but tweaking some stuff to find the best work environment.
This is what I call the loop (referring to the Bandersnatch here). You are in the loop. You need to get out and you need to get sh*t done. Don&#x27;t worry about using the best tool out there, don&#x27;t try to find the absolute efficient program. Just get it done.
This is in actuality a paradox. The paradox goes as such, &quot;The more choices you have, the less satisfied you are&quot;. Seems about right when you think for a bit.</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using Ubuntu/Debian/Nitrux/Manjaro ARM as my main go-to OS&#x27; for several years now. I absolutely love being part of this vast community of great individuals.
&quot;Linux is difficult&quot; - &quot;Packaging is hard&quot; was once the most predominant ways for software companies to tell users, why they didn&#x27;t support Linux. 
But these days we got things like AppImages[1], which I think is very underappreciated within the community (just a feeling, no figures to back it up). Actually I&#x27;m unaware why AppImages aren&#x27;t already part of all Linux distros out there. I guess it&#x27;s because everyone is trying to roll their own distribution formats?
Anyway, An AppImage is a container format much akin to Mac Applications. You just download an AppImage from e.g. AppImageHub[2], set the execute permission on the file and off you go. No installation required - you can even place the AppImage file where ever you&#x27;d like. If you want to skip the &quot;set execute bit&quot; step and need tighter GUI integration there&#x27;s a daemon called appimaged[3] that you can run beforehand which will take care of all this.

sudo virsh list --all. # to all the VM in the Host Machine 
sudo virsh destroy  # Stopping or Shutting down the VM
sudo virsh dumpxml vm-name &gt; vm-name.xml # Export the VM setting in XML Formate
sudo cat vm-name.xml | grep source # to list the attached Partition
sudo lvremove /partition/name # remove the LVM Partition 
sudo rm -rf /RootParition/Centos.img # To remove the .img and .qcow2 partitions
sudo virsh undefine  # Removing the VM from the Host Machine, before execute
sudo virsh vncdisplay # to display the VNC port number

Host Machine should have the Public and Private Network and VM should configured via bridge network from Privat network. 
Using SSH tunnel we can connect the VM, before pls install VNC viewer in your local - https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/
From Local Machine
ssh -L localhost:5900:VM-IP:VNC-Port-Number username@hostmachine.com

For Example
HostMachine: dhanesh.vm-test.com (Public IP)
ssh -L localhost:5900:192.168.100.100:5912 dhanesh@dhanesh.vm-test.com

Finally open the VNC viewer and type localhost:5900 you can able to see the VM from your local machine. 
Ensure that all the Network settings are working fine.</span>

                    <span>For a couple of days, I was looking for a simple terminal-based text editor for taking simple code notes or basic code fixing kinds of stuff.
As an aspiring developer, I really like the concept of coding without touching the mouse.
So I downloaded the king of CLI text editors, Vim.
Now, guess what happened.
Yeah, you&#x27;re right. I stuck inside vim and couldn&#x27;t even quit from there.
Then, I started watching a bunch of tutorials and started reading vim&#x27;s documentation.
This tutorial from Ben Awad helped me to get started.
But then I realized, I have to learn a lot of things only to operate vim and it&#x27;s a pretty lengthy process.
At that time, I really needed a very simple text editor for doing basic stuff.
But, vim is not simple... you know :)
So, I had to come back to &#x27;nano&#x27; &amp; I was not happy …</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
