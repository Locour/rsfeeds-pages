                    <span>Vim is a text editor with a huge following. It&#x27;s installed by  default on every Linux system and even on Mac OS X.
Vim is a tool that wants you to succeed. if you want something to happen, you can make it happen. It works completely by keyboard shortcuts. 

It gives you the power to manipulate text at a fundamental level. you can operate on individual characters, words or lines of text this gives vim a really powerful interactive feel.
If you are new to vim, I recommend these exercises
I am often connecting to remote machines and editing config files. 
This was cumbersome, as I would have to use SFTP to copy files, manually updating the buffer when the file was modified on the remote machine. 
It was too easy to get distracted and lose track of what I was doing.
If you want to edit files on a remote server, try this command:
vim scp://you@remote_ip//path/file.txt

and change username to your username, your remote ip, the path and the filename.
vim scp://frank@192.168.2.7//home/frank/hello.txt

If you have vim open, you can also do :e scp://you@remote_ip//path/file.txt
You can use sftp too:
vim sftp://user@remote_ip//path/file

Change it with your username, remote ip and path to the file.
vim sftp://frank@192.168.2.7//home/frank/hello.txt

If you want to use the old unencrypted ftp protocol
:e ftp://[user@]machine/path/

Vim is relentlessly awesome. It does everything an editor should do and nothing it shouldn&#x27;t. There are no gimmicks, no silly settings, no bloat. It just works. all the time. no exceptions.</span>

                    <span>Are you tired of scanning images and trying to shrink them under 25 mbs just so you can send them via email ? Look no further, I am here to save you from this trouble. (that kinda rhymed.)
This basic shell script uses ghostscript to compress your scanned pdfs significantly. Just yesterday I scanned 100 pages of documents and it was over 90 mbs. I searched for a way to compress them under 25 mbs and voila. Here I was with only 6 mbs of pdfs. Much wow. Such compression.
Why we need it,
Fast.
Ez.
No need to go online. Especially no need to upload company top-secret documents to any website you see on the Internet.
Possible huge compression without notable loss.
Command usage:
./shrinkpdf.sh in.pdf out.pdf
ghostscript.





If you are in a situation exactly like me where there are 100 pdf files under one folder that you want to compress altogether, a simple for loop will suffice.
import os
import subprocess
import sys

infolder &#x3D; sys.argv[1]
outfolder &#x3D; &quot;compressed_&quot; + infolder
os.mkdir(outfolder)

for f in os.listdir(infolder):
    subprocess.run([&quot;./shrinkpdf.sh&quot;, os.path.join(infolder, f), os.path.join(outfolder, f)])

Run this python script,
python shrink.py pdfs/
and all of your pdfs will be put under compressed_pdfs/.

                    <span>Introduction


Hey now, you have probably went through numerous job-hunting websites and you memorized all the buzzwords (Junior Sysadmin; Junior Site Reliability Engineer; NOC Engineer; System support; etc.) that can get you in IT with zero experience, or even zero education. Well, let me tell you - you are on the right track! However, there are some insights that a lot of you don&#x27;t know as you haven&#x27;t got a real Linux job. Well now, except you are on the right track, you are on the post, as well!
I am going to note down &amp; explain the top 10 Linux skills (in the opinion of a person who had a Linux job as a first) that you should have before rushing into the interview.

                    <span>The Linux command line is for power users. It is not for the faint of heart or for people who are afraid to take a risk. 
If you are new to Linux and are afraid to take the plunge into using the command line interface, then this tutorial is a good start. 
Linux is an open source operating system that is used on everything from smart phones to main frame computers. 
Linux provides a command line interface (CLI) that provides a quick and powerful way to control and manipulate your computer. Once mastered, the Linux CLI can save you time and provide a powerful tool to aid in your daily tasks.
The command line can be intimidating but learning the basics will give you access to a world of scripts and automation tools that will make your life a lot easier and more productive.
The Basics: You will be using the command line to type various commands and tasks. Commands are what Linux runs. In Linux, the Command Line can be used for various things.

To start, open up a terminal. Now, let&#x27;s try using some basic Linux commands! 
Most of these commands are applicable for all Linux distributions. Linux is case sensitive (capitalization matters).
Navigation
ls    List directory
cd DIR Change the current directory to the DIR directory
cd ~  Change to home directory
cd /      Change the current directory to the root directory
cd ..     Go one directory lower
pwd   Show name of current working directory 
File Commands
mkdir -p DIR Create directory DIR 
rm FILE Remove FILE
rm -r DIR Remove DIR and its contents recursively
rm -f FILE Force remove FILE 
System Info
date  Print or set the system date and time
cal   Displays a calendar
uptime Tell how long the system has been running
w     Show who is logged on and what they are doing
whoami  Print effective userid</span>

                    <span>Vim is the most famous text editor many programmers use for coding on the Linux terminal.
Vim is a text editor for Linux. Many people have grown up using Vim, that and its ubiquitous nature means it can be found on any Unix/Linux system. 
Many “power users” swear by the power and functionality of Vim, however many people see it as intimidating and complicated. If you are new to vim, I recommend these exercises
Vim can be downloaded and installed from a software repository. Vim is often installed by default on Linux systems and even on Mac OS X.
You can install vim with your package manager
sudo apt-get install vim

The reasons for this are simple: it&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s powerful, and it comes in both a terminal emulator and a GUI version. 
You can use it locally or over an ssh connection. It can even be used inside IDEs as a plugin.
Vim allows programmers to edit text quickly and efficiently. You can jump to the end of file using G, top of file using gg and to line 10 using 10G. Vim allows you to record and replay keystrokes and has many many more features.

Vim 8 comes with built-in support for Python, PHP, Perl, Ruby and Tcl programming languages.
Vim as a code editor but it&#x27;s much more powerful than you may think. Before you do anything else, you should know that:
Vim is not a text editor that uses a mouse. It&#x27;s a program that uses keyboard shortcuts to perform all of the tasks.
Vim is hard to learn. You will have to spend a lot of time practising and mastering your skills before using it effectively.</span>

                    <span>How you can use Node.js to send messages via WhatsApp with Twilio&#x27;s API.



  
  
  First, here the things that you need:



Node and npm installed
Create an account with  Twilio  (it&#x27;s free)
And finally, Twilio and dotenv library
Once you sign up for the Twilio account, activate the Sandbox for Whatsapp. This enable you a shared phone number and allows you to test with WhatsApp service. 
Then you have to opt in sending a message to the phone number provided from the sandbox. The message should say &quot;join mass-there&quot;, if everything is ok you will receive a confirmation response. 

Once you are in the directory where is created the project, in the terminal run the following commands:
npm init -y

npm install twilio@3.30.0 dotenv

The first one to iniciate a package.json and the second one for install the dependencies.
The next step is create the file index.js with the following code:
const { config } &#x3D; require(&#x27;./config&#x27;);

const accountSid &#x3D; config.sid;
const authToken &#x3D; config.token;
const client &#x3D; require(&#x27;twilio&#x27;) (accountSid, authToken);

client.messages.create({
    from: &#x27;whatsapp:+14155238886&#x27;,
    body: &#x27;Hello world this is CarlosVldz!!!&#x27;,
    to: &#x27;whatsapp:+5215555555555&#x27;
}).then(message &#x3D;&gt; console.log(message.sid));

(Don&#x27;t forget replace the phone numbers in this example with your sandbox number and a personal number.)
Finally I used dotenv to configure the environment variables TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID and TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN with their values from the account credentials. You can find both in your Twilio console. 
.env.example
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID &#x3D; &quot;Your account sid&quot;

TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN &#x3D; &quot;Your auth token&quot;

In your terminal run this last command to send the WhatsApp message:
node index.js

In your phone check WhatsApp and you should have a new chat like this.

Hope you liked! (:</span>

                    <span>This time we learn to create a secure API REST with CRUD operations like Create, Read, Update and Delete.
This development include a public and private API, for security we use JWT for authentication and Bcrypt for hashing our passwords. The database engine is run by MongoDB.
REST API: it&#x27;s an interface between systems that use HTTP protocol for obtain data and perform operations. In this case we will use the most important operations: POST, GET, PUT and DELETE.
Node.Js: it&#x27;s a runtime environment based in JavaScript for the server side, is asynchronous and event oriented architecture. Based on Google&#x27;s V8 engine.
JWT: it&#x27;s an open standard ( RFC-7519 ) based in JSON to create a token that serves to send data between applications and services, guaranteeing that is authentic.
Bcrypt: is a p…</span>

  The baseline project


This post assumes you are following along with the baseline project tutorial, but the concepts apply to any Typescript project.
As our codebase expands, so does the risk of introducing bugs and inconsistent styling. We are going to use two tools to help enforce some Typescript best practices and general code formatting guidelines:
ESLint
eslint is a linter, which is a static code analysis tools that can scan our codebase and throw errors and warnings if there are any issues in our codebase.
Prettier
prettier is an automatic code formatter that automatically formats our code with consistent styling.
We can manually run these tools to lint and format our codebase, but we are also going to enforce these rules by setting up git hooks - sc…</span>

                    <span>Auto-instrumenting AWS Lambda Monitoring didn’t originate through a focus group or business plan. It started as a hackathon project that addressed the tedium of removing manual code instrumentation. Developer environments often include hundreds of AWS Lambda functions. And our existing instrumentation required initialization code to be manually placed on every single function. So to fix this, our growth team used Amazon CloudWatch to build a prototype that could instrument AWS Lambda functions.
This prototype began by using AWS CloudFormation stack to automatically create resources in a customer environment. Then we streamed Amazon CloudWatch Logs to Sentry through the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. This made it so all you had to do was put in your AWS account ID and create the stack using …</span>

                    <span>If you want to be a full-stack web developer and stuck at just beginner projects, here is the chance to improve your skills and create something real. I decided to share my 9 hours tutorial series on YouTube for free.
We are going to create a social media application from scratch. And this project is not going to include just a basic couple of methods and an unpleasant design, it&#x27;s going to include a complete web API, impressive React components, and chat functionality.
Let&#x27;s dive into it!
In this section, we are going to create an Express server and the MongoDB connection. You are going to learn how to create Models and Routes. And after the section, you will be able to create your own web API, login and register operations, and CRUD for users and posts.





  
  
  Designing React Components


In this section, we are going to design Facebook like website using reusable React components and React Hooks.





  
  
  Creating MERN Stack Social Media App


In this 3rd section, we are going to combine our Rest API and React UI design. You are going to learn real-world usage of a MERN application.





  
  
  React Chat App Using Socket.io


In the final section, we are going to design a React messenger component and some additional routes in Node.js to get and post chat messages. And finally you are going to learn how to use Socket.io to send instant messages and notifications.




I hope it was useful. If you want to learn more about web development and practice with real-world projects, you can check my channel out.

                    <span>Métodos


Para fazer uma busca por documento no MongoDB utilizamos os métodos find() e findOne(), que recebem dois tipos de parâmetro: a query, que irá fazer a busca no nosso banco de dados e o segundo parâmetro, que dizemos o que será retornado.
Nosso Documento
{
    &quot;name&quot;: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    &quot;password&quot;: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    &quot;email&quot;: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    }
}

Exemplo do Comando
const query &#x3D; { name: &quot;Emanuel&quot;}
const retorno &#x3D; { name: 1, email: 1, password: 1}
const users &#x3D; User.find(query, retorno)

O Método find retorna uma array com todos os documentos que foram encontrados utilizando o campo name. 
Query
const users &#x3D; User.find({ name: Emanuel })

Retorno

                    <span>scriptum is a type validator and a functional library build upon it. A type validator is distinguished by a static type checker like Typescript by operating at runtime. Besides it doesn&#x27;t infere types from terms but only checks applications.
Doing without type inference sounds like a silly idea but fortunately the validator can resort to Javascript&#x27;s introspection means, so the developer only has to annotate function types.
Technically speaking scriptum is based on the Hindler-Milner type system extended by higher-kinded/rank types and row polymorphism. 
A runtime type system can never attain the soundness of a static one. You can think of it more as a tool for gradual typing. Here is a complex, real world example that should give an intuition how expressive this approach is.

                    <span>Creating the bot


Go to the discord developer portal and click on create new application. Now choose the name and click create. Now click on Bot and click add bot, next click yes, do it. 
To invite the bot, click on oauth2, then choose the bot scope now scroll down and give the bot the admin permission. Now copy the link and paste it into your browser and you will be able to invite it to any server you own. 
Open up your text editor of choice and execute

npm init -y &amp;&amp; npm i discord.js 


Explanation: npm init -y creates our package.json and npm i discord.js installs the discord.js libary in order to interact with the discord api. 
index.js and paste in the following code:

var discord &#x3D; require(&quot;discord.js&quot;); // imports the discord.js libary
var client &#x3D; new discord.Client(); // this is the main way we interact with the discord api   
client.on(&#x27;ready&#x27;, () &#x3D;&gt; { // executes when the bot is online
    console.log(&quot;Bot online&quot;)
})
client.on(&quot;message&quot;, (msg) &#x3D;&gt; { // executes on a new message
    if(msg.content &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;!ping&quot;){
        msg.reply(&quot;pong&quot;)
    }
})
client.login(&quot;your-token&quot;) // replace &quot;your-token&quot; with your bot token from https://discord.com/developers/applications


Now replace &quot;your-token&quot; with your bot token from the discord developer portal. Next, run the following command:

node index.js


You should see in the console: Bot online and if you send  !ping in your discord server with the bot you&#x27;ll see the bot reply with pong.

Unforgettable year 2020, new company and new team. I remember, with Selenium and Java in resume joining new work place. The rationale for switching to WebdriverIO started with a project member saying “Start exploring WEBDRIVERIO” in call. A quick search on the YouTube and I landed on channel called Naveen Automation Labs where I started the playlist and I was able to write my first test. I recommend everyone to check it out as you will gain enough knowledge to start your journey.

                    <span>Maybe you have been developing Apis to be consumed by a website, mobile or desktop application. And one of the points that you need to learn in a quick and simple way is how to implement authentication and authorization in your Api.
Obviously, there are several strategies, from the most popular, such as cookies, sessions and JWT. However, in recent years there has been a huge popularity in the use of third party services like OAuth. However, I am always reticent about whether or not I will give the sensitive data of my users to another company.
I would also add that implementing OAuth can be challenging, at least on the server side. However, in this article I will talk about JWT and I will give a simple example of its implementation.

                    <span>Version 2.4 of Foal has been released! Here are the improvements that it brings.
$data references for validation


Version 2.4 allows you to enable the AJV $data option so that you can use the verified data values as validators for other values.
config/default.json
{
  &quot;settings&quot;: {
    &quot;ajv&quot;: {
      &quot;$data&quot;: true
    }
  }
}

Example of auth controller
import { Context, Post, ValidateBody } from &#x27;@foal/core&#x27;;

export class AuthController {
  @Post(&#x27;/signup&#x27;)
  @ValidateBody({
    type: &#x27;object&#x27;,
    properties: {
      username: { type: &#x27;string&#x27; },
      password: { type: &#x27;string&#x27; },
      // &quot;password&quot; and &quot;confirmPassword&quot; should be identical.
      confirmPassword: {
        const: {
          $data: &#x27;1/password&#x27;,
        },
        type: &#x27;string&#x27;,
      },
    }
    required: [ &#x27;username&#x27;, &#x27;password&#x27;, &#x27;confirmPassword&#x27; ],
    additionalProperties: false
  })
  signup(ctx: Context) {
    // Do something.
  }
}


Starting from version 2.4 the Disk.createHttpResponse method accepts an optional parameter to specify the value of the Cache-Control header.
import { Context, dependency, Get } from &#x27;@foal/core&#x27;;
import { Disk } from &#x27;@foal/storage&#x27;;

import { User } from &#x27;../entities&#x27;;

export class ProfileController {
  @dependency
  disk: Disk;

  @Get(&#x27;/avatar&#x27;)
  async readProfileImage(ctx: Context) {
    return this.disk.createHttpResponse(ctx.user.avatar, {
      cache: &#x27;no-cache&#x27;
    });
  }

                    <span>WhatsApp is an instant messaging application that Facebook owns. It is the third most used messaging application, according to Messenger People. Although it uses end-to-end encryption, it still collects more metadata on its users than other messaging applications like Signal. 
In January 2021, news circulated that WhatsApp planned to roll out in-app notifications to users, informing an update in its Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It was up to the user to accept the new WhatsApp Privacy Policy and Terms of Service to continue to use the messaging application.
The company tweaked its terms of service and privacy policy which notified users once they entered the application. Users had to accept these updates to continue to use the application, and these changes were scheduled to be implemented on February 8th, 2021. The following were the updates made in terms of service and privacy policy:
WhatsApp’s service and how we process your data
How businesses can use Facebook hosted services to store and 
manage their WhatsApp chats
How they partner with Facebook to offer integrations across the 
Facebook Company Products

                    <span>CSRF (cross-site request forgery) is a type of attack on a site that is carried out using a fraudulent site or a script that causes the user&#x27;s browser to perform an undesirable action on a trusted site where the user is logged in.
Usually, to do this, the user must click on a fraudulent link (which can be changed using a link shortener).
For example, Jane, who is logged in to the bank&#x27;s website, checks her email. They may click on a phishing link that includes a request to transfer money to the fraudster&#x27;s account.
Due to the fact that it is authorized on the bank&#x27;s website, the bank will process the transfer request.

                    <span>🖥 Let’s see why caching has become one of the most crucial concepts in computer science. We will dive into the concept of caching, understanding what it is, how it works, and what are the most important types of caching.



  
  
  
Over the past few years, information technology has been improving whatever kind of business drastically. Meanwhile, software architectures have become increasingly complex, and the number of their users has grown exponentially. This has represented a performance challenge for any application. Slow performance can undermine the strategic goals of any company, which is why finding smart ways to improve it is critical. As a consequence, avoiding overhead and reducing data retrieval and processing time has become imperative. This is where caching comes into play …</span>

                    <span>Dear Coder,
If you&#x27;re working on an application that allows users to register an account, you&#x27;ve likely encountered the issue of role-based security.
What is role-based security and why do we need it?
Say you&#x27;re working on an application that allows users to share webcomics with each other. You&#x27;ve already built in the features that allow the user to securely upload photos to your database, and you&#x27;ve implemented features that allow users to register an account and log in.
But now you need to ask what features should be accessible to any user regardless of if they&#x27;ve registered an account, what features should be accessible to registered users, and what features should be available to privileged users.
This is where role-based security comes in.
For the sake of my illustration, let&#x27;s catego…</span>

Have you noticed the number of Indian startups making international news lately? Well, the world media and investors sure have, and with good reason. The startup scene in India has not only weathered the last year of global uncertainty, it’s managing to thrive by staying focused on core offerings. According to a report from KPMG and Pitchbook, that worked out to 2019 Q3 returns in the $3.6 billion range. 
Fortune India reports that as of the end of 2019, India was home to 26 unicorns. And according to Inc42, by the end of 2020, 11 more were added to the ranks. That’s an increase of 42%, during a global pandemic no less. The keys to this success are v…</span>

                    <span>Hey guys,
I&#x27;m building an online e-learning platform for hackers (you can see some screenshots/videos here), and two of the demographics I&#x27;m trying to reach are: 
Experienced developers who already know how to create backend or full-stack applications but don&#x27;t necessarily know about all of the security hazards or how to exploit them as an attacker.


Beginner developers who know what a variable or a function is but don&#x27;t yet understand how the HTTP protocol or browsers or web applications in general really work.



Because it&#x27;s difficult to really put oneself in someone else&#x27;s shoes, I humbly ask for your help. If you belong to either of the two demographics, and are interested in the topic, what would be most important to you in an e-learning platform that aims to teach about hacking and defending against the attacks?
Feel free to suggest specific content, features, or anything at all. The page I linked above should give a pretty good overview of the current idea that I have about what it could look like.
Thanks in advance! And sorry I know this is a bit of a plug but there is no better place to ask (:</span>

  The baseline project


This post assumes you are following along with the baseline project tutorial, but the concepts apply to any Typescript project.
As our codebase expands, so does the risk of introducing bugs and inconsistent styling. We are going to use two tools to help enforce some Typescript best practices and general code formatting guidelines:
ESLint
eslint is a linter, which is a static code analysis tools that can scan our codebase and throw errors and warnings if there are any issues in our codebase.
Prettier
prettier is an automatic code formatter that automatically formats our code with consistent styling.
We can manually run these tools to lint and format our codebase, but we are also going to enforce these rules by setting up git hooks - sc…</span>

                    <span>scriptum is a type validator and a functional library build upon it. A type validator is distinguished by a static type checker like Typescript by operating at runtime. Besides it doesn&#x27;t infere types from terms but only checks applications.
Doing without type inference sounds like a silly idea but fortunately the validator can resort to Javascript&#x27;s introspection means, so the developer only has to annotate function types.
Technically speaking scriptum is based on the Hindler-Milner type system extended by higher-kinded/rank types and row polymorphism. 
A runtime type system can never attain the soundness of a static one. You can think of it more as a tool for gradual typing. Here is a complex, real world example that should give an intuition how expressive this approach is.

Unforgettable year 2020, new company and new team. I remember, with Selenium and Java in resume joining new work place. The rationale for switching to WebdriverIO started with a project member saying “Start exploring WEBDRIVERIO” in call. A quick search on the YouTube and I landed on channel called Naveen Automation Labs where I started the playlist and I was able to write my first test. I recommend everyone to check it out as you will gain enough knowledge to start your journey.

                    <span>Version 2.4 of Foal has been released! Here are the improvements that it brings.
$data references for validation


Version 2.4 allows you to enable the AJV $data option so that you can use the verified data values as validators for other values.
config/default.json
{
  &quot;settings&quot;: {
    &quot;ajv&quot;: {
      &quot;$data&quot;: true
    }
  }
}

Example of auth controller
import { Context, Post, ValidateBody } from &#x27;@foal/core&#x27;;

export class AuthController {
  @Post(&#x27;/signup&#x27;)
  @ValidateBody({
    type: &#x27;object&#x27;,
    properties: {
      username: { type: &#x27;string&#x27; },
      password: { type: &#x27;string&#x27; },
      // &quot;password&quot; and &quot;confirmPassword&quot; should be identical.
      confirmPassword: {
        const: {
          $data: &#x27;1/password&#x27;,
        },
        type: &#x27;string&#x27;,
      },
    }
    required: [ &#x27;username&#x27;, &#x27;password&#x27;, &#x27;confirmPassword&#x27; ],
    additionalProperties: false
  })
  signup(ctx: Context) {
    // Do something.
  }
}


Starting from version 2.4 the Disk.createHttpResponse method accepts an optional parameter to specify the value of the Cache-Control header.
import { Context, dependency, Get } from &#x27;@foal/core&#x27;;
import { Disk } from &#x27;@foal/storage&#x27;;

import { User } from &#x27;../entities&#x27;;

export class ProfileController {
  @dependency
  disk: Disk;

  @Get(&#x27;/avatar&#x27;)
  async readProfileImage(ctx: Context) {
    return this.disk.createHttpResponse(ctx.user.avatar, {
      cache: &#x27;no-cache&#x27;
    });
  }

                    <span>JSDoc refers to JavaScript documentation through comment blocks, it is similar to the JavaDoc. With it, it is possible to type-check your JavaScript code and avoid setting up a build/compilation step in your project. This method still requires TypeScript, but only for developing, not to ship your code.
Why would anyone want to use JSDoc instead of TypeScript for type-checking?
If you&#x27;re building a frontend application using a library like React, you will probably use a tool such as Webpack (or Vite) to bundle/compile your code into JavaScript that browsers can understand. In that case you might as well use TypeScript because you already have a build step. Though, if you think the Hot Reloading or the build step are too slow, JSDoc could still be of help.
Now if you&#x27;re building a library, t…</span>

Runtime Templates Using String Identifiers
Many of the applications I develop for clients most often involve mathematical sciences, ranging from physics and engineering to financial modeling to data analytics. These applications regularly employ components in which the majority of the component’s runtime display is driven by external data. We are all familiar with using binding to alter some portion of a component. A fully data-driven component will also have other aspects of its display controlled by external data.
For example, it is common in the utility industry to display, analyze, and even edit load profiles. Each profile contains one or more time series such as ‘raw data,’ ‘cleansed data’, ‘gross’, ‘AMI’, etc. Each of these series has some meaning t…</span>

Besides being a specialist in front-end and back-end development, a full-stack developer is likewise proficient in several other fields. Full-stack programmers will be able to play the role of web developers and mean-stack developers
plus DevOps developers. They need to be theoretically sound in just about all aspects of development and technology.
Some programming languages which full-stack developers must get better at happen to be JavaScript, React.js, MongoDB, node, in addition to Python. The future of the majority of the full-stack developers is great because o…</span>

                    <span>I’m a big fan of Angular, I’ve been using it for years now, for a variety of projects. I’ve written about it and helped others learn it. One thing that I have noticed that a lot of developers who start using Angular who have come from a different technology stack, is that they try to apply the style and approach they have in another framework or language to Angular. This can lead to extremely messy code or Angular code that is hard to maintain as a project grows.
The reason I feel this happens is Angular is an opinionated framework, there is an approach you take to write Angular apps. If you try to ‘build’ an Angular app in a way that goes against this approach, then things can start to go wrong.
In Angular there are some things you should do:
Split your functionality into modules

                    <span>When should I use NgRx or Redux?


&quot;When should I use NgRx&quot; is a question whose answers have changed several times over the years, and personally I find a lot of the guidance available online to be a little too &quot;does it feel right&quot; and “can something else handle what you are doing”. While informative and a great way to learn about some new libraries, this is largely not helpful for deciding when to say “yes, I would benefit from using NgRx for this project”. Over the last several years I’ve tried to come up with a mental framework for deciding whether or not a project would benefit from NgRx, and decided to share what I’ve come up with and see what others think.
Obviously this is subjective and I would love to hear what others have to say and see what the community would add or remove to t…</span>

Host Machine should have the Public and Private Network and VM should configured via bridge network from Privat network. 
Using SSH tunnel we can connect the VM, before pls install VNC viewer in your local - https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/
From Local Machine
ssh -L localhost:5900:VM-IP:VNC-Port-Number username@hostmachine.com

For Example
HostMachine: dhanesh.vm-test.com (Public IP)
ssh -L localhost:5900:192.168.100.100:5912 dhanesh@dhanesh.vm-test.com

Finally open the VNC viewer and type localhost:5900 you can able to see the VM from your local machine. 
Ensure that all the Network settings are working fine.</span>

                    <span>What are Azure Roles and Custom Definitions?


When you start working more and more with Azure permissions you will undoubtedly have used Azure RBAC (also known as IAM) and have most likely used some of the great built-in roles that have been created and provided by Microsoft, but sometimes you may come across a requirement or a need to have a very specific role tailored with a set of permissions that are more granular than what comes out of the box in a standard Azure (RBAC) built-in role.
Luckily Azure offers a great deal of flexibility when it comes to defining your own custom roles vs built-in roles. This is where Custom Role Definitions comes into play.

Understanding of AWS CDK (Cloud development kit)
Understanding of AWS Custom resources
All through the blog I will be mentioning terms custom resource lambda and custom resource. Both terms look similar but actually are different. Custom resource lambda refers to the lambda that is responsible for implementing the logic. Custom resource is the resource itself that is created by invoking the custom resource lambda.
In this blog I am covering a niche scenario related to AWS custom resources when all your custom resource lambda needs is to call an AWS API. Usual use case of doing so would be when cloudformation does not support a resource and it is only available with an API.
For all other use cases, please refer to my earlier blog Custom Resources with AWS CDK.

                    <span>The high-availability features of MySQL InnoDB Cluster in its open source (Community) edition have come a long way, and in recent years the 8.x versions have delivered immense improvements in this area over the veteran 5.7 versions. I&#x27;ve found that monitoring such a cluster with OSS tools to be more involved, and through this post I hope to shed some light and share what has worked for me and my team.
TL;DR



8.x InnoDB Clusters (single Primary) are more tolerant to network failures (Auto Rejoin)

5.7.x InnoDB Clusters can also be managed using MySQL Shell from the 8.x series, although you will miss some of the newest management features (e.g. Clone)
Prometheus  and MySQL Exporter will enable you to monitor cluster members as reported in the replication_group_members table.

                    <span>Computer Vision(CV) is a field of Artificial Intelligence(AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs- and make recommended output based on that.


If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.
CV trains their machine to do such work but it should do those work in lesser time with the use of cameras or algorithms as compare to retina or nerves.
48.6 billion by 2022.



  
  
  How does Computer vision works?


Computer vision requires lots of data for getting good accuracy.
openCV 
There are many research has done in this field, but apart from it there are many uses of CV in business, entertainment, transportation, healthcare and everyday life.
Image Classification:
It sees an image and can classify it (a dog, an apple, a person’s face).
Object detection:
It can use image classification to identify a certain class of image and then detect and tabulate their appearance in an image or video.
Object Tracking:
It follows or tracks an object once it is detected. This task is executed by with image capturing in sequence or real-time.
Content-based image retrieval:
It uses computer vision to browse, search and retrieve images from large data stores, based on the content of the images rather than metadata tags associated with them.(PS:This is most useful application of CV)
You can check out my github repository where I have made many projects based on CV.

                    <span>For the last couple of years, I have been in the Linux space and mostly tried to find the best distro, best file manager, best terminal etc. I was caught up in the loop of finding the best programs to handle a job. This approach, unless controlled, usually leads to low productivity in the long term.
How so you might ask ? Well, this behavior is really relatable for some people. When I am talking about this subject, some of you might probably say, &quot;Oh yes I have been there&quot;. In Linux world, there is even a term for this. Ricing.
Ricing means tweaking the configuration of your working environment to suit your personal needs. At particular level, one might consider this useful, and it indeed is. There are some workflow approaches, shortcuts and others that helps the developer access files and folders faster, learn by muscle memory and perform some set of actions quicker. Past that particular level and you are now in the over-ricing zone. Where you are essentially tweaking every aspect of each program, work environment to your needs, but at the same time you are never satisfied so you keep tweaking and changing settings, configs and what not. It reduces your productivity and at the end of the day when you look back, you realize you have done nothing but tweaking some stuff to find the best work environment.
This is what I call the loop (referring to the Bandersnatch here). You are in the loop. You need to get out and you need to get sh*t done. Don&#x27;t worry about using the best tool out there, don&#x27;t try to find the absolute efficient program. Just get it done.
This is in actuality a paradox. The paradox goes as such, &quot;The more choices you have, the less satisfied you are&quot;. Seems about right when you think for a bit.</span>

&quot;Linux is difficult&quot; - &quot;Packaging is hard&quot; was once the most predominant ways for software companies to tell users, why they didn&#x27;t support Linux. 
But these days we got things like AppImages[1], which I think is very underappreciated within the community (just a feeling, no figures to back it up). Actually I&#x27;m unaware why AppImages aren&#x27;t already part of all Linux distros out there. I guess it&#x27;s because everyone is trying to roll their own distribution formats?
Anyway, An AppImage is a container format much akin to Mac Applications. You just download an AppImage from e.g. AppImageHub[2], set the execute permission on the file and off you go. No installation required - you can even place the AppImage file where ever you&#x27;d like. If you want to skip the &quot;set execute bit&quot; step and need tighter GUI integration there&#x27;s a daemon called appimaged[3] that you can run beforehand which will take care of all this.

sudo virsh list --all. # to all the VM in the Host Machine 
sudo virsh destroy  # Stopping or Shutting down the VM
sudo virsh dumpxml vm-name &gt; vm-name.xml # Export the VM setting in XML Formate
sudo cat vm-name.xml | grep source # to list the attached Partition
sudo lvremove /partition/name # remove the LVM Partition 
sudo rm -rf /RootParition/Centos.img # To remove the .img and .qcow2 partitions
sudo virsh undefine  # Removing the VM from the Host Machine, before execute
sudo virsh vncdisplay # to display the VNC port number

Host Machine should have the Public and Private Network and VM should configured via bridge network from Privat network. 
Using SSH tunnel we can connect the VM, before pls install VNC viewer in your local - https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/
From Local Machine
ssh -L localhost:5900:VM-IP:VNC-Port-Number username@hostmachine.com

For Example
HostMachine: dhanesh.vm-test.com (Public IP)
ssh -L localhost:5900:192.168.100.100:5912 dhanesh@dhanesh.vm-test.com

Finally open the VNC viewer and type localhost:5900 you can able to see the VM from your local machine. 
Ensure that all the Network settings are working fine.</span>

                    <span>For a couple of days, I was looking for a simple terminal-based text editor for taking simple code notes or basic code fixing kinds of stuff.
As an aspiring developer, I really like the concept of coding without touching the mouse.
So I downloaded the king of CLI text editors, Vim.
Now, guess what happened.
Yeah, you&#x27;re right. I stuck inside vim and couldn&#x27;t even quit from there.
Then, I started watching a bunch of tutorials and started reading vim&#x27;s documentation.
This tutorial from Ben Awad helped me to get started.
But then I realized, I have to learn a lot of things only to operate vim and it&#x27;s a pretty lengthy process.
At that time, I really needed a very simple text editor for doing basic stuff.
But, vim is not simple... you know :)
So, I had to come back to &#x27;nano&#x27; &amp; I was not happy …</span>

                    <span>Hi, first of all I would like to tell you what IRC is, I will explain it in simple words so that even non-technical people can start playing with IRC.
Today I will describe how to start chat with IRC with my favorite IRC Weechat client, it&#x27;s a terminal client, but don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s very easy to configure and use on a daily basis, and if you have your own server you can even set it up in screen -S weechat :)
Shall we get started? Here we go!
First we need to install our new IRC client, there are many ways to install it, depending on which system you use.
pacman -S weechat and on macOS brew install weechat.
No worries as you saw the word compile, weechat is very easy to compile :)
You can skip the compilation step and download the finished weechat from weechat.org. But what fun is that?

                    <span>Vim is a  text editor which is highly efficient. It is an improved variant of the vi editor, that is distributed with UNIX systems. 
Vim is often called a &quot;programmer&#x27;s editor,&quot; and so useful for programming that many consider it an entire IDE. It&#x27;s not just for programmers, though. Vim is perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing configuration files.
The vim text editor is an extremely powerful tool for developers, but it can be difficult to master.  If you are new to vim, I recommend these exercises
If you&#x27;re using a Mac or a Linux machine, it&#x27;s likely that your terminal has vim built in, so it&#x27;s worth being familiar with to work on those systems. 
If not, you can install vim with your package manager or test if vi is installed.
To install vim for Ubuntu, follow these instructions.
1: Open a terminal window and type sudo apt-get install vim
sudo apt-get install vim

2: If you want to get updated version of vim, open a terminal window and type sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get update

3: Then type sudo apt-get install vim
sudo apt-get install vim

The installation process will take some time, after which all the commands of vim will be available.

To start vim, just type vim in the command line
vim

Then you can type ESC followed by :e filename to open filename.
To open a vim directly from the command line, type:
vim filename

Press ZQ to quit vim without saving. Press ZZ to save and exit.
To move the cursor, you can press ESC and use the keys h,j,k,l.  You can also use the arrow keys in vim.

Vim has modes. To switch to writing mode, press the i key or the insert key. To switch to command mode, press the ESC key.
To save your file press ESC followed by :w.
Press :Explore to open the file explorer. Use the j and k keys and press enter to open the file. You can also use :LExplore</span>

                    <span>Learning Linux commands is one of those things that help you in your everyday life as a programmer, systems administrator or IT professional. So today I compiled a list of everyday linux commands that you might find useful in real life.
Linux is solid, but you don’t realize how much you depend on it until something goes wrong. Whether it’s a simple fix or you have no idea what’s going on. We’ll start with the basics:
ls : List contents of directory
$ ls
public_html

$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 owner group 0 Jan 23 13:09 index.html

$ ls -l /tmp/
total 616
drwxrwxrwt 27 root root 4096 Oct 22 14:09 .

cd : Change directory
user@hostname:~$ cd /etc
user@hostname:/etc

user@hostname:~$ cd /usr/local/bin
user@hostname:/usr/local/bin

pwd : Show current directory
user@hostname:/usr/local/bin$ pwd
/usr/local/bin
user@hostname:/usr/local/bin$ 

sudo : run command as root (admin)
$ sudo ls
[sudo] password for user: 

run a program
$ ./app

As a Linux user, you have more commands than you can count at the tip of your fingers.
In fact, you have enough commands to do every day tasks, including:
Using git version control for your project
Connecting to your web server over ssh
Controlling your file system
Searching for files containing a particular word in the file path
Backup databases or interact with them
See your web server logs for security attacks
Opening up a terminal-based text editor either locally or remotely

                    <span>A brief and useful content about the mechanics on Cross-Origin Read Blocking, Cross-Origin Resource Policy and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing against Meltdown, Spectre and CSRF Attacks.
By design, Cross-Origin Read Blocking validates browser requests before they even reach the server using their MIME type as a validation rule.
To enable it, send the HTTP header X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff  from the server.
Cross-Origin Resource Policy is a complementary CORB mechanism for validation applied to requests flagged with no-cors to invalidate them if they came from different domains or origin.
Send the header Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy from the server with values same-origin or same-site to invalidate no-cors requests from different domains or origin.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a logical context mechanism that ensures minimal security in the way that users consume web content using browsers instructing how the browser will validate the origin of the requests.
To define rules about how the origin of the request will be identified, send the HTTP header Access-Control-Allow-Origin using values like  and even a more generic approaches using *.
Hope that now you understand a bit better why to use these Cross-Origin Resource features
Try don&#x27;t disable or ignore them in your web applications. Spectre, CSRF, and Meltdown attacks are really dangerous.

                    <span>Recently I start to explore the Azure SignalR Service for one of my chat based web wpplication.
Azure SignalR Service simplifies the process of adding real-time web functionality to applications over HTTP. This real-time functionality allows the service to push content updates to connected clients, such as a single page web or mobile application. As a result, clients are updated without the need to poll the server or submit new HTTP requests for updates.
To put more simple word Azure SignalR is a PaaS helps us to update the Client (UI) without refreshing the Page - So Cool😎 Is it?
For that I need to come-up with a architecture, So I start doing a POC - &quot;How to securely connect a Azure SignalR Service from a simple ChatBased Application&quot; ?

Blame Netflix or Spotify.
In fact, take your pick of any of the digital brands that have made seamless and beautiful UX a staple part of daily life. From one-click checkouts on Amazon to Single Sign-On across all of Google’s services, consumers have never had it better for digital experiences….and they are now expecting it everywhere they go online. 

Login boxes are the first thing many people engage with on a website. Yet, the importance of them can sometimes be relegated to “as long as it works, it works.”
The challenge is consumers don’t just want things that work; they want things that work so well they never even notice it. 
And so here are five ways in which your login box is turning your customers away from your brand.

                    <span>Storing sensitive values in Octopus Deploy solves many problems. If your organization has standardized on a secrets manager though, that might mean storing sensitive values twice, making secrets management more complicated.
Octopus has supported the concept of sensitive variables since Octopus 2.0, but customers often ask about support for secret managers. One in particular is HashiCorp Vault.
In this post, I walk through a number of new HashiCorp Vault step templates designed to retrieve secrets from Vault for use in your deployments or runbooks.

                    <span>Motivation to create Ditsmod


Before creating Ditsmod, of course, I was looking for: &quot;Are there ready-made solutions for my purposes?&quot;.
I believe that the set of the following features is unique at the moment:
The framework is written in TypeScript (and under the hood there is no ExpressJS or Fastify ;).
Modular architecture with decorators.
Has a hierarchical Dependency Injection that allows you to use classes as a search token, rather than their names.
Clearly delineated providers arrays for DI injectors at the application, module, route, or request level.
Built-in support for nested routes, such as /api/posts/:postId/comments/:commentId.
Check for collisions when importing providers. This feature allows you to detect situations where you import two or more modules that export providers…</span>

                    <span>As an Angular developer, one of my biggest challenges was shifting my thought process from mutable-, to immutable state.
In an Angular service, you can simply assign a new value to a property, and like magic - the change detection would kick in and update any component using the property. 
Switching over to React, suddenly immutable state is the way to go! Then, suddenly Redux - actions, reducers, middleware, dispatchers, and the list goes on. 
The first time I saw Redux toolkit, the very first thing that hit me, in Reducers:
...
reducers: {
    increment: state &#x3D;&gt; {
        state.value +&#x3D; 1;
    }
}
...

Assignment operator in a Reducer? For a brief moment I thought I somehow ended up in the Vuex documentation, this is how you update state in mutations. But No, it was Redux Toolkit.

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
