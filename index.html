A few months back, I was working on a web-based project where a feature was required that is to take a screenshot of an HTML div in the browser and show it to the user. I was like, sorry this is not possible. Then I did some research and got to know about this library called html2canvas.
So in this article, I will show how can we capture a screenshot of a web page or any element of it using html2canvas.

One of the neat features about GitHub is the generation of permalinks urls that highlights a range of line numbers. This is particularly useful when you want to highlight a chunk of code or a line to show it to someone else. 
To do so, just navigate to the file you want on github and click on one line, hit the Shift key and click on the end line for the code block. This generates a URL with the highlighted block content that you can then use for sharing.

Head-up displays are also transforming the retail sector, especially in small stores where there is limited space to showcase all the products. For example, car dealership does not have to showcase latest car models in store, but customers can view them virtually, configure them according to their requirement, and get an idea of their purchase.

AWS application workloads requiring high-throughput IOPS and/or low-latency often leverage io1/io2 EBS volumes. Similar to the benefits realized from migrating general purpose EBS volumes, you can also upgrade provisioned volumes to gp3 and reduce your cloud spend in the majority of use cases. In this article, we discuss when it makes sense to upgrade your io1/io2 volumes, how to do it yourself manually, and an alternative solution called CloudFix which automates this process at scale acr…</span>

Prior to users enjoying the app, there is only one more thing left to do- release the app to the App Store! Surely, you think it shouldn’t take longer than a few minutes of your time?
Oh, you’re completely wrong.

                      <span>The next method we will cover is slice(). Rather than modifying an array, slice() copies or extracts a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it is called upon untouched. slice() takes only 2 parameters — the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction (extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index). 
Ex:




function forecast(arr) {
 let todaysWeather = arr.slice(2, 4)
 return todaysWeather;

                      <span>What if we want to remove an element from somewhere in the middle? Or remove more than one element at once? Well, that's where splice() comes in. splice() allows us to do just that: remove any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array.
splice() can take up to 3 parameters, but for now, we'll focus on just the first 2. The first two parameters of splice() are integers which represent indexes, or positions, of the array that splice() is being called upon. And remember, arrays are zero-indexed, …</span>

                      <span>pop() removes an element from the end of an array, while shift() removes an element from the beginning. The key difference between pop() and shift() and their cousins push() and unshift(), is that neither method takes parameters, and each only allows an array to be modified by a single element at a time.


Let's take a look:




function popShift(arr) {
  let popped = arr.pop(); 
  let shifted = arr.shift(); 
  return [shifted, popped];
}

console.log(popShift(['challenge', 'is', 'not', 'complete']));

how to add the port 8080/tcp in my system and list all the active ports in a text file called "zones.txt". I use a Linux Mint 20.1 XFCE system and I came across the apt-package named Uncomplicated Firewall. This package allows you to open ports on your system and makes them ready for use using ssh. 
Here is a screenshot on how to progress with the procedures.

I am also attaching my GitHub gist which provides an detailed explanation on how to implement this in your system.

Then we are going to have a hook which return an object that will map the properties from the object properties one by one and returns the input component with the properties that we passed. For handle the fo…</span>

It won't be any specific code that is understandable for only developers who worked with Node before. Because this material is about TypeScript I want to specify more on TypeScript itself.

Since { appears in the seventh character of the image, we can a find out that the flag format is picoctf{***}. This means that 16→P, 9→I, 3→C, 15→O, 3→C, 20→T, and 6→F are used.

All you need to do is decode A1Z26 with Cyberchef or convert it manually to get the flag.

First, this decorator we use for:
This decorator is listening for a specific event by the host element
Go to the code example:
Each time you click inside the component, the counter will increase by 1
  @HostListener("click", ["$event"])
  onClickEvent(event: Event) {
    this.clicksCounts += 1;
  }

According to the official Typescript document: "TypeScript is an open-source language that builds on JavaScript, one of the world’s most used tools, by adding static type definitions."

This project was started with the idea of being flexible when it comes to styling; it allows the developer to opt-out of the pre-packaged theme, without leaving the theme-specific classes in the markup.
