When developing an Angular application with Angular Material, there comes a point when we need to add icons on our components, or buttons etc‚Ä¶ Angular Material has the Mat-Icon component for doing this. This component works with web fonts like Font-Awesome for instance, simply by adding the name of the image required and an image is displayed.
Note: Requires an Angular application with Angular Material installed and configured with a reference to Font-Awesome library.

We know the simplest way to view traffic is using the network tab in DevTools, but sometimes you need to add another tool to your debugging arsenal. Using an interceptor will help you tap into the http request pipeline so you can work your magic and log all of your routes in a nice color-coded format so they stand out.

If you are like me, a VIM user, but have never used windows, now is a great time to do it!
The main reason I didn&#x27;t use windows in VIM is because I use Tmux. But this is a bad reason, and not everybody is used to use Tmux, even though you should because this is a fantastic tool.
The second bad reason why I don&#x27;t use windows is because I don&#x27;t really like the key combination. Since most of the keys are used for something very logical, there is no more space for using window efficiently, meaning we ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>At Grouparoo, we use Actionhero as our Node.js API server and Sequelize for our Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tool - making it easy to work with complex records from our database. Within our Actions and Tasks, we often want to treat the whole execution as a single database transaction - either all the modifications to the database will succeed or fail as a unit. This is really helpful when a single activity may create or modify many database rows.

It‚Äôs been a long time since I last wrote something here. A few days ago I was thinking about something that might be interesting to share with you about REST APIs automation testing. So the idea came to me:
Why not use Cypress to create a complete API testing project &gt; from scratch? We can use TDD to create the test, do all the &gt; necessary validations and put this into a CI pipeline! 
So lets go for it!
I will split this project into three parts, so that the content does not become too boring.‚Ä¶</span>

We know the simplest way to view traffic is using the network tab in DevTools, but sometimes you need to add another tool to your debugging arsenal. Using an interceptor will help you tap into the http request pipeline so you can work your magic and log all of your routes in a nice color-coded format so they stand out.

                    <span>Question:
closures in JavaScript.
Quick answer:
function getCounter() {
    count &#x3D; 0
    return function {
        count +&#x3D; 1
        return count
    }
}

Longer answer:
Higher Order Functions in JavaScript, which means you can create and return functions out of the functions. 
As we also know, functions can access each of their outer scopes.
function a() {
    let variable &#x3D; &quot;hello world&quot;
    function b() {
      console.log(variable)
    }
    b()
}
a() // hello world

Recently, I came across a substantial Angular project with a lot of unused imports. Not that it is a big deal but it looked quite messy, which I find to be a pity as they can easily be automatically removed.
In this article, I will show you how to do so with any node-based project using ESLint. It might sound like a very cosmetic thing and it kind of is, but I believe having too many unused imports can really hurt code readability.
And as a bonus, we will also sort our import‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Why worry about Security?


Before starting to see about Strapi&#x27;s Content-Types, before looking at Next.js&#x27; file and route structure, it&#x27;s good to discuss Security.
A concern that usually is not followed up with due attention in certain teams, and that can cause a very high cost, when a project is put into production.
This article is another introductory article to the Next.js + Strapi stack, we will also cover TypeScript, Data Fetch, Layouts, CI / CD and Deploy, but first of all we will cover security.

Introduction

After implementing filters, another issue that arises is how to identify previously applied filters after a component containing a table has been destroyed. Here is a use case: We have a component showing a list of customers in a ta‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Why do we even need custom domain-specific languages?
First of all, we should define what do we mean by custom domain-specific languages.
In everyday programming, we have to encode real-world problems in code. We are limited by the power of expressivity of the language we are using. The programming languages are fairly low when it comes to model the real world.
Basically, we translate from a human language to a more basic form of language that a computer can understand.

Estruturas que iremos testar:
Pipes
Services
Como mostrado no post anterior os testes de Pipes n√£o tem segredo.
Sempre que poss√≠vel, √© interessante testar todas as poss√≠veis varia√ß√µes dos valores de entrada (limites do dom√≠nio de entrada) para que n√£o tenhamos nenhum caso n√£o tratato, pois n√£o saberemos quem poder√° utilizar nossa Pipe.

                    <span>Step 1. First we need to import Title service -
import {Title} from &quot;@angular/platform-browser&quot;;

Step 2. Using setTitle -
 constructor( private title: Title) {
 this.title.setTitle(&#x27;page title changed&#x27;);
 }

All together -
import {Title} from &quot;@angular/platform-browser&quot;;
@Component({
 selector: &#x27;app&#x27;,
 templateUrl: &#x27;./app.component.html&#x27;,
 providers : [Title]
})

 constructor( private title: Title) {
