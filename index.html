  Introduction


This article targets beginning to intermediate-level Angular developers and covers a wide variety of topics that arise in production applications. While centered around the concept of editing tabular data, these techniques may be used in a variety of other Angular applications.
For anyone who has read at least one of my articles, you should understand that my background is applied mathematics and scientific computing. So, this article continues the trend of exploring the use of Angular in scientific and business (analytics) applications.
Working with time-series data is a fundamental concept in numerous business and engineering sectors. In this context, f…</span>

Video &amp; Streaming don&#x27;t have to be complicated for the web anymore! in this tutorial we will build an Angular app using Amazon IVS &amp; Video.js in less than 15 minutes!!
Amazon IVS (Amazon Interactive Video Service) is a fully managed live streaming solution: simply stream to Amazon IVS, and the service does everything you need to make low-latency live video available to any viewer around the globe. Amazon IVS handles the ingestion, transcoding, packaging, and delivery of your live content, using the same battle-tested technology that powers Twitch.
For more information on Amazon IVS check https://ivs.rocks

                    <span>In my last post about change detection, we touched on the basics of it. In this article, we will try to understand more about ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush method. So let us get started.
So first thing we will discuss is how to convert the component to the Onpush strategy. Let say we have a Sample component and we are having a default change detection strategy(by default all newly created components are having default change detection), it will be like:
import { ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component, OnInit } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;

@Component({
  selector: &#x27;app-sample&#x27;,
  templateUrl: &#x27;./sample.component.html&#x27;,
  styleUrls: [&#x27;./sample.component.scss&#x27;]
})
export class SampleComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
  }

}

This is one of the most common interview questions in front end development and common answer will be 

Hoisting is not what you think!!!😕
If you are trying to search and learn about hoisting, almost everywhere you will be seeing the same definition. May be that&#x27;s beginner friendly but definitely that&#x27;s not true. In JavaScript, Nothing will be moved.

Before we start, let us understand how our code will be executed in javascript engine.

                    <span>Data binding is the automatic synchronization of data between model and view. In Angular, we have 3 fundamental ways to make to-and-fro binding between view and source.
Source to View (one-way)
View to Source (one-way)
View to Source to View (two-way)
This refers to as Property binding method, it includes all following patterns to share data from source to view.
Interpolation refers to embedding expressions into markup text. By default Angular interpolation uses {{ and }} to encapsulates the expression.
{{title}}

 


Apart from element properties, we have element attributes ARIA and SVG for which we can use attribute bindings:
{{actionName}} with Aria

Single class binding
[class.sale]&#x3D;&quot;onSale&quot;

Multiple Class bindings
[class]&#x3D;&quot;&#x27;my-class-1 my-class-2 my-class-3&#x27;&quot;

Single style binding


Multiple styles binding


More specifically, we call this Custom Event binding, utilizing Angular Event Emitter. 
Consider the following code showing button which alerts on click. The alert content is passed through  component template using custom event showMessage():





  
  
  3. View to Source to View (two-way)


Angular two-way data binding is the combination of square brackets [] and parentheses (). [()] refers to property binding followed by event binding.

So here is YamlLint!
You can find on their website all that you will need to use it, but here is a quick look!
Depending your project, you can :
install it directly on your machine if you are on Linux




sudo apt-get install yamllint

install it with brew



brew install yamllint

add it in your Python project



python setup.py sdist
pip install --user dist/yamllint-*.tar.gz

Then you can use it directly with the default configs, or override it with your configs.
To do it, create a .yamllint file at the top level of your project. Then, in this file, you can enable/disable rules or override rules ...
example

Before we start, what is CI-CD flow in the first place?
Despite the fact that Django code doesn&#x27;t require any build step compared to compiled apps, you might find it quite frustrating to repeat a manual re-upload each time you need to deploy a new feature or a bug fix. Because of this, CI-CD (Continuous integration and Continuous delivery) workflows were invented.
CI-CD workflows or pipelines allow us to safely build, test and …</span>

                    <span>Javascript can be described as a prototype-based language. This stems from an object&#x27;s ability to have a prototype object, which allows them to inherit features from one another. You can read more about this in the MDN Web Docs.
But if you&#x27;ve ever looked at an arrary in your console, you may notice __proto__, what exactly is that? 
If you don&#x27;t already, open up your browser console. Now, create an empty array ([]). After you create the array, expand it using the &gt; icon. Viola! You will see the **proto** attribute.
[]
length: 0
__proto__: Array(0) // &lt;--- Here it is!
length: 0
constructor: ƒ Array()
concat: ƒ concat()

It does not matter how you create your array, you&#x27;ll always find the proto attribute.

                    <span>Intro


HCL, the language of Terraform, has come a long way since 0.11. With its many new releases, the ability to consume JSON and create adaptive Terraform has become considerably easier with additions like for loops, arrays, and maps
Consuming JSON and then working with it is not always the easiest. In this post, I&#x27;ll be showing how to consume JSON in 3 different ways:
Reading a file in the local directory
Reading in JSON from an AWS S3 bucket
Passing in JSON via environment variables
Why these 3 specific options? Well, all 3 are totally viable ways to consume JSON and are largely dependent on what your needs are. If the JSON is static, reading from S3 might be a good option. If you are running Terraform in a containerized environment, passing in as an environment variable may be a good…</span>

You need to have Node, yarn, and npm installed on your machine. To check if they are installed, open up a terminal window and type the following:
npm -v
yarn -v
node -v

If these commands print out a version number in the terminal, you are good to go. If not, you need to go ahead and install what is missing.
Node (contains npm)
Yarn

Let&#x27;s start.
To create a project, you need to type the following in the terminal:

Once the operation finishes, you will have a boilerplate React project, ready to go. To see if it works properly run the command:

In bonus I will show you where you can bug domain name for 2$ and connect it will Netlify !
First step:
Create an account on https://www.netlify.com/.
In the overview, you will need to connect your git project to Netlify.

Go to https://app.netlify.com/start Select your plateform between Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket.
Second Step:
Choose the branch to deploy, it&#x27;s means that when you will push onto this branch, Netlify will build the project and re-deploy it.

For me I create a dedicated branch named prod.
Third Step:

You will need to provide the npm command that will build your project (and the output directory name). 
I use npm run build and I named the output file /dist (classic).

This results in a real VM that can boot instantly, while using very limited resources. If done properly, slim can allow you to design and build immutable unikernels for running services, or build tiny and embedded development environments.
Slim currently supports Virtualbox, KVM, and hyperkit (MacOS only) as providers for running VMs. Slim will discover all available providers, defaulting to virtualbox, if more than one provider is available. The -p flag can be used to force Slim to use a specific provider.
You can find repo here
 / 
        slim
      
    
 

slim will build a micro-vm from a Dockerfile. Slim works by building and extracting a rootfs from a Dockerfile, and then merging that filesystem with a small minimal kernel that runs in RAM.

Create a micro-vm from a Dockerfile. Use build command with a directory containing a Dockerfile.
$ slim build images/alpine3.8-simple



This will add a bootable iso in the slim registry. See example Dockerfile.

Solarwinds scrutiny is well-earned these days. Despite being a security company by nature and owning two logging companies - Loggly &amp; Papertrail - I can’t help but notice they aren&#x27;t taking care of their own business.
For example, if you follow the Loggly or Papertrail default instructions, your syslog will be configured to send everything over the internet as plain-text. Of course, they support TLS and have advanced/optional instructions for configuring that but after decades of experience in software and devops we know the danger of defaults against a motivated attacker.

Okay so I&#x27;ve written about jpex a few times, particularly in relation to react
Essentially it allows you to do something like this:
import { useResolve } from &#x27;react-jpex&#x27;;

const useMyDep &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
  const dep &#x3D; useResolve();
  return dep.someValue;
};

and this:
import { encase } from &#x27;react-jpex&#x27;;

const useMyDep &#x3D; encase((dep: IDep) &#x3D;&gt; () &#x3D;&gt; {
  return dep.someValue;
})

depending on your preferred flavour.
Jpex uses the service locator pattern to resolve and inject dependencies, plus it&#x27;s super-powered by Typescript inference for a super slick experience. But the really really cool thing about it is you can test your react components with the provider component to stub your dependencies:

URL shorteners like Bitly and Cuttly are incredibly popular. In this article, we are going to create a similar tool by building an API service that shortens the URLs provided to it.

For the project, we are going to use MongoDB and Node.js, so you should have basic knowledge of them for this tutorial.
Let&#x27;s first plan out the building process, which is pretty straightforward. For each URL passed into our API, we will generate a unique ID and create a short URL with it. Then, the long URL, short URL, and unique ID will be stored in the database.
When a user sends a GET request to the short URL, the URL will be searched within the database, and the user will be redirected to the corresponding original URL. Sound complex? Don&#x27;t worry, we&#x27;ll cover everything you need…</span>

Hello there, this sentence will mark the beginning of my first ever article released to the public. In this, and the following articles I will introduce beginners to the magical world of Discord bots. I will be using the new discord.js v13 library. However, there are certain prerequisites.
At least beginner knowledge of Javascript. I&#x27;ve seen this all too much, eager new developers asking to be spoon-fed basic Javascript and Node.js fundamentals. There are innumerable fantastic resources out there, like freeCodeCamp. Don&#x27;t be scared to use Google, DuckDuckGo, or any other search engine.
Node.js and NPM installed on your machine. As this is an article about Discord.js solely, I wont be going in to the specifics here. You can download Node.js and NPM @ https://nodejs.org/. Agai…</span>

GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs. It enables clients to specify queries and allows servers to validate data against a strongly typed schema.
Unlike REST APIs, GraphQL uses a single endpoint for all operations. GraphQL-based servers can only communicate via GraphQL queries. For simple projects, it’s feasible to use a REST client, like Axios or fetch(), to send GraphQL queries. However, for larger, more complex projects that have advanced requirements, a GraphQL client is needed.
GraphQL clients make communication easier by abstracting away small details and implementing additional features, some of which include caching, query batching and deduplication, and static typing of GraphQL query results.

Enter software development and i realize i still can&#x27;t run away from tests. Why do we even have to write tests? Tests are important in the software development cycle because it bears witness to these thing;
Your understanding of the problem you are trying to solve, writing tests will prove that you understand the problem and the software requirements.
That your solution is actually doing what you built it to do? How else can you prove that? We can run it in the browser to check the result of our code but that&#x27;s only good for simple projects where you have a lot of time, and if you are mostly concerned with the look and design.
It is a  really good form of documentation.

                    <span>Managing the global state of a web application is one of the biggest challenges we face today. Although we have several solutions, I think the biggest problem is that we use certain libraries that need a huge boilerplate even if you need to make a small change.
One of the libraries that makes life easier for me in my opinion is Jotai. Which in my opinion has an approach that greatly simplifies managing the global states of our applications.
Other libraries already take the worry out of how you should structure our react components, but on the other hand they force us to structure our stores. However with Jotai it&#x27;s super simple, you declare one thing or another and start using it (it&#x27;s literally like that).

                    <span>I was working on a project for graduation called Roots, and I needed a way of exporting a web experience to an executable. I never expected this to be such a difficult thing to find information on. Granted, there are not a lot of use cases for this. Since I could not find a good way of exporting a web experience to an executable, I embarked on a quest to figure this out for myself.
Some might wonder: &quot;Why would you want to export an executable from the web?&quot;. In my case, I needed this for my  graduation project Roots. Roots is a 2D narrative game engine in the browser. Here are the pros to giving the option to create a executable to your users.
The main thing with Roots was that it has to be simple, so everybody with a browser can use it. And letting users try to host their projects online…</span>

It&#x27;s shocking because sometimes, you just cannot use them whether you have impairments or not.

Labels allow screen readers to voice the input prompt to the user. Unfortunately, many websites use placeholders only.
It&#x27;s a terrible practice as screen readers will try to guess things, for example, by taking texts that precede or follow, which might have nothing to do with the inputs.
Besides, placeholders disappear when the inputs are focused.
So don&#x27;t do that:


Instead, do something like this:

JavaScript’s dynamic nature allowed it to become the de facto language for the browser and the most popular programming language in the world.
One of the most useful JS features is, for example, immediate parsing. This feature means that the browser executes the code right as it downloads content, naturally providing benefits. However, with this level of freedom also comes responsibility.
In this article, weʼd like to delve into the JavaScript security risks and how to protect JavaScript code. This time we will cover only front-end code that runs on the browser, but we have another tutorial on protecting Node.js apps.

const useMyDep &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
  const dep &#x3D; useResolve();
  return dep.someValue;
};

and this:
import { encase } from &#x27;react-jpex&#x27;;

const useMyDep &#x3D; encase((dep: IDep) &#x3D;&gt; () &#x3D;&gt; {
  return dep.someValue;
})

depending on your preferred flavour.
Jpex uses the service locator pattern to resolve and inject dependencies, plus it&#x27;s super-powered by Typescript inference for a super slick experience. But the really really cool thing about it is you can test your react components with the provider component to stub your dependencies:

    jpex.constant(mockValue);

Enter software development and i realize i still can&#x27;t run away from tests. Why do we even have to write tests? Tests are important in the software development cycle because it bears witness to these thing;
Your understanding of the problem you are trying to solve, writing tests will prove that you understand the problem and the software requirements.
That your solution is actually doing what you built it to do? How else can you prove that? We can run it in the browser to check the result of our code but that&#x27;s only good for simple projects where you have a lot of time, and if you are mostly concerned with the look and design.
It is a  really good form of documentation.

  Introduction


This article targets beginning to intermediate-level Angular developers and covers a wide variety of topics that arise in production applications. While centered around the concept of editing tabular data, these techniques may be used in a variety of other Angular applications.
For anyone who has read at least one of my articles, you should understand that my background is applied mathematics and scientific computing. So, this article continues the trend of exploring the use of Angular in scientific and business (analytics) applications.
Working with time-series data is a fundamental concept in numerous business and engineering sectors. In this context, f…</span>

                    <span>As I started building forms with React and JsonForms library, I found myself in the need of a custom layout for rendering array of items with eventually nested arrays, without all the whistles and bells of the default material-renderers. After some digging in the source code I was able to come out with a custom array layout with my personal style. I will share in this post how to structure your project in order build great custom JsonForms components.
let&#x27;s create a demo project for our needs. Open a terminal and type:
$ npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript

then install needed dependencies:
$ npm install --save @jsonforms/core
$ npm install --save @jsonforms/react
$ npm install --save @jsonforms/material-renderers

                    <span>Data binding is the automatic synchronization of data between model and view. In Angular, we have 3 fundamental ways to make to-and-fro binding between view and source.
Source to View (one-way)
View to Source (one-way)
View to Source to View (two-way)
This refers to as Property binding method, it includes all following patterns to share data from source to view.
Interpolation refers to embedding expressions into markup text. By default Angular interpolation uses {{ and }} to encapsulates the expression.
{{title}}

 


Apart from element properties, we have element attributes ARIA and SVG for which we can use attribute bindings:
{{actionName}} with Aria

Single class binding
[class.sale]&#x3D;&quot;onSale&quot;

Multiple Class bindings
[class]&#x3D;&quot;&#x27;my-class-1 my-class-2 my-class-3&#x27;&quot;

Single style binding


Multiple styles binding


More specifically, we call this Custom Event binding, utilizing Angular Event Emitter. 
Consider the following code showing button which alerts on click. The alert content is passed through  component template using custom event showMessage():





  
  
  3. View to Source to View (two-way)


Angular two-way data binding is the combination of square brackets [] and parentheses (). [()] refers to property binding followed by event binding.

On 24th April, Angular announced the deprecation of their end-to-end (E2E) testing tool, Protractor. It remains unclear whether there will be a successor or if Angular will delegate this to its users. At the time of this writing, WebDriver.IO, TestCafé and Cypress have come up with schematics for the Angular CLI.
This is the follow-up to my article about E2E frameworks in general in which I will help you get started with E2E testing in Cypress.

                    <span>Now, We are ready to build our first Flutter AppImage app 🚀


Firstly , we will change our working directory to the project directory.
$ cd flutter_appimage

1- Create folder  AppDir
$ mkdir AppDir

2- Generate the YAML recipe file required to build the AppImage
$ appimage-builder --generate

this command will prompt some questions. Here is the final output :
INFO:Generator:Searching AppDir
? ID [Eg: com.example.app]: com.example.flutter_appimage
? Application Name: Flutter AppImage

                    <span>Flutter is one of the fastest-growing cross-platform UI frameworks with a great and powerful community which has a great part of Flutter success.

Lately, Flutter announced desktop support including Linux which got the attention of big corporates like Canonical (Publisher of Ubuntu), and lately announced that they are rebuilding Ubuntu Desktop Installer using Flutter.
Flutter official docs also have a section on how to build and package Flutter Linux app in Snap (Linux Universal Package Manager) and ship it to Snap Store. here
So it will be interesting if we tried to package Flutter Apps using another universal package manager which is AppImage.
Linux OS (I will use Manjaro)

                    <span>Vim and BASH?


Bash Scripting is a powerful skill to have as a programmer because we find Linux almost everywhere and to get through it you must have a command over its interface which is generally the BASH shell. Vim is a great option for doing this, or probably the best out there! Because Vim is pre-installed in almost every Linux distribution. This is not an in-depth setup for BASH on Vim, it is a simple editorial on starting up BASH scripting on the Vim editor. So without wasting time on &quot;Vim features&quot; let&#x27;s dive in with the setup for BASH in Vim.
Setting up a bash script doesn&#x27;t require much code but still in some cases it can be a bit hassle and to avoid the repetitive task, one can easily set up a macro for the boilerplate BASH script.

The goal here is to create a fully-functional forever-updateable system. So the two things that this is not:
it is not just a “live boot”;
this is not just something to then use to install Linux onto the internal hard drive of a computer.
Rather, this is Linux ready to plug into the USB port of any computer that can be told to boot from that. Every time you boot this system, it will inspect and deal with the hardware that it finds.
This way, the external USB drive becomes your &quot;system&quot;, and the computer is just the commodity used at the time. Depending on your use cases:

A Linux-based hardware RAID is hardly a good example of a reliable storage system – if one of the disks within the array gets disconnected, the whole RAID can’t be mounted, and all the information becomes inaccessible in a second. In this case, you will need a special utility to rebuild the array with the remaining (healthy) drives. It will find and display the data which is still there, and restore this information.
We will perform all the tests with Hetman RAID Recovery. Its main purpose is to search and restore information from inoperable drives…</span>

                    <span>Creating CRUD without security in mind can bring you to security disaster. Check out this article how to do it correctly.
I am an open-source developer working on Databunker. Today I got a question from one of the guys on a social network.
It is totally true, you can go DIY. On the other hand, Databunker grew to be a better solution than you can think about.
Databunker is a special application server used for the secure storage of customer data. It is not a full-fledged database. In the backend, it is using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite to store encrypted customer records. The product comes with full GDPR compliance and is built with privacy-by-design architecture.
Any company implementing Databunker has a quick and easy way for GDPR and privacy-by-design compliance in addition to much better security.
Hashicorp Vault is a great product. It is built for completely different use cases.
For example, when saving records in Databunker, Databunker knows to extract user email, phone, login identity, and custom identity and built a secure hashed-based index to do a quick user record lookup.
User record CRUD is just a part of the service. In Databunker, you have a secure session storage API, temp shareable identities API, automatic record expiration and removal, compliance with pseudonymization, DPO management, user-accessible UI, and more.
Besides you can go with a free version with an MIT license.
It is up to you to go with Databunker or build your own solution.
Just do not leave customer data unencrypted.

Still nothing is displaying.

Alright, lets check out the other ports open on the box.

It&#x27;s a quick fix!
Just disable Print Spooler service on Windows 10 and Windows Server environments.
Open PowerShell as Administrator
Run Command:




Stop-Service -Name Spooler -Force

Prevent the service from starting back up again during restart:
Set-Service -Name Spooler -StartupType Disabled

We hope this helps save you from ransomware.

                    <span>When you start learning TypeScript, you will come across two types - any and unknown.
any - The any type allows us to assign literally “any” particular value to that variable, simulating what we know as plain JavaScript.
unknown -  The unknown type is the type-safe counterpart of any. Anything is assignable to unknown, but unknown isn&#x27;t assignable to anything but itself and any without a type assertion or a control flow based narrowing.
Errghh... Let&#x27;s understand with an example.
let age: number;
let userAge: any;

userAge &#x3D; &#x27;This is some age&#x27;;
userAge &#x3D; 20;

age &#x3D; userAge;

And yes, This code works! 🎉 Type of userAge is any so it can be assigned any value - string, number etc.
let age: number;
let userAge: unknown;

userAge &#x3D; &#x27;This is some age&#x27;;
userAge &#x3D; 20;

age &#x3D; userAge;

The statement age&#x3D;userAge gives an error. I mean, the type is unknown so what is the problem here? To assign an unknown value to a value with a fixed type, we have to do some quick type check!
let age: number;
let userAge: unknown;

userAge &#x3D; &#x27;This is some age&#x27;;
userAge &#x3D; 20;

if(typeof userAge &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;number&#x27;) {
  age &#x3D; userAge;
}

And now this works too! 🎉
When to use what? 🤔
unknown is a better choice if you know what you want to do with that value eventually. 
I hope you learnt at least something. Also, this was my first ever post on Dev! Thank you for reading :)</span>

                    <span>Pretty import paths?


We&#x27;ve all seen relative file import paths inside react applications. If you structure your apps like me you end up with terribly long paths to import other components. Auto-import can take care of that for you automatically, but isn&#x27;t it hard to read and let&#x27;s be honest, very, very error prone?
One way to solve this issue is adding webpack aliases. Now if you created your application using the create-react-app cli, you will notice that there isn&#x27;t a webpack config to mess with unless you eject it running npm run eject, which will expose the entire configuration and makes you responsible of maintaining it. I prefer not ejecting my react application because I prefer the ease of use using react-scripts, so there must be another way.

                    <span>An interesting feature was added to TypeScript recently that will improve the ergonomics of code that relies on type narrowing or discrimination:
TS 4.4 (currently beta) can infer when a variable&#x27;s type implies something about the type of another.
A simple example given in the PR description:
function fn(x: unknown) {
    const isString &#x3D; typeof x &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;string&#x27;
    if (isString) {
        x.length  // Ok
    }
}

In TS 4.3.4, accessing x.length is a type error...
Even though we know that if (and only if) isString is true, x must be a string, the type checker doesn&#x27;t know that!
This is because isString is just a stupid old boolean - it doesn&#x27;t know or care why it happens to be true or false.
For TS to understand the expression implies something about its inputs, typeof x &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;string&#x27; has to …</span>

Here is where the magic happens with this process. When I’ve identified duplicated data and move it to a central location not only does my code become more consistent and simplified but it is also more maintainable.
It is true that I am often working in prototype code so it really doesn’t “matter” that I have some duplication going on. Or even that the code isn’t maintainable because it’s all a prototype right now anyway.

Angular is a client-side TypeScript based framework which is used to create dynamic web applications. 
-Support TypeScript
Components and services both are simply classes with decorators that mark their types and provide metadata which guide Angular to do things.
Every Angular application always has at least one component known as root component that connects a page hierarchy with page DOM. Each component defines a class that contains application data and logic, and is associated with an HTML template that defines a view to be displayed in a target environment.

Here are three methods. (1) and (2) are need to be secured as they have more privileges over your docker daemon. You can use firewall in docker or make it rootless.

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>
