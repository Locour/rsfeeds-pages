In this short article, I’m going to show you a liveness probe in action. Liveness probes are used to check if a Pod is healthy (running as expected) or not. It simply acts as a check for Kubernetes to know when it should restart the container.

However, it all falls apart pretty quickly in simple console-focused scenarios, when you don’t need the power of all the metric tools. Let me show you what I mean.

When talking about connecting databases in NestJS, we have TypeORMModule for MySQL and MongooseModule for MongoDB available. There might be a scenario where we are required to connect to a database with our own/custom database module. This could be an example when we want to connect to MongoDB native driver without using mongoose ORM. 
This is for someone who is beginner in NestJS and has the understanding of TypeScript. Optionally, has used TypeORM or Mongoose module in NestJS projects.

As developers we often perform POST and PATCH requests to API from our frontend apps. When we use TypeScript, this code should be typed safely. There are multiple ways to do so. Let's analyze one of them!
Let's imagine a player entity from a game:
// Create a type for our object
type PlayerType = {
  hp: number
  name: string
  position: [number, number]
}

// We can also use interface:

One of the "bad" names is "Infrastructure as Code". I think it misleads more than it reflects the idea. 
In the era of self-hosted systems, infrastructure was managed by directly handling hardware and manually setting configurations. This approach does not work any longer in the age of cloud computing. It does not scale, it is too slow, and too risky.

  Introduction


Let's talk about this really funny protocol, funny is a weird word for a networking protocol, but I'll try to make my point. I will try the same approach as my last post on TCP, making a simple python script and taking a look to Wireshark. Let's start.

Yep in my opinion UDP(User Datagram Protocol) is barely a protocol, I know I'm a not a computer science guy, but still it doesn't seems to fit on that category of protocol. Let me clarify that UDP is extremely …</span>

In many cases, the tools we are using (like Github, until recently anyway) could only embed image content into READMEs and Pull Requests. That meant that the humble animated gif was often the best way to share a video. Here is my personal script called gifit which uses the open source ffmpeg and gifsicle tools to make it super easy to convert any video file into an easy-to-share gif!
