                    <span>Intro


Sometimes I join online events.
So this time I will try converting.
Node.js ver.16.4.2
TypeScript ver.4.3.5
moment ver.2.29.1
moment-timezone ver.0.5.33
ts-loader ver.9.2.3
webpack ver.5.42.0
webpack-cli ver.4.7.2
For getting my own timezone, I just create a Date instance.
const currentDate &#x3D; new Date();
console.log(currentDate);

Sun Jul 11 2021 08:39:08 GMT+0900 (Japan Standard Time)

The timezone came from OS settings.
I can create Data instances by formatted string.
const currentDate &#x3D; new Date(&#x27;Jul 10 2021 19:48 EDT&#x27;);
console.log(currentDate);

Sun Jul 11 2021 08:48:00 GMT+0900 (Japan Standard Time)

I was able to implement everything I wanted to achieve...?

                    <span>Beside functions being first class citizens in JavaScript, there are plenty of other features, allowing functions to make an extra mile ride. Closures are one of them. 
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment)
Mozilla 
Let&#x27;s take an example:
function adder(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a + b;
  };
}

let add5 &#x3D; adder(5);
let add10 &#x3D; adder(10);

console.log(add5(2));  // 7
console.log(add10(2)); // 12

From above code, it&#x27;s clear how closures work, and how it remembers the lexical scope, the function was declared within. But how this could be useful, or is it just non-practical questions in JavaScript interviews? 
Don&#x27;t worry, we have got plenty of applications and usage, of Closures th…</span>

probably due to some recent package updates, I needed to tweak dependencies before the installation passed.

                    <span>Hi all, in this series we are discussing Angular Change Detection, in the last post we discussed the OnPush change detection strategy, in this, we will see how can we customize the change detection using attaching and detaching change detector.
So the concept here is like when in the component we detach the change detector, Angular will not perform change detection for that component and its subtree, and when we reattach it change detection will happen.
GitHub and Stackblitz.
import { ChangeDetectorRef, Component, OnInit } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;

@Component({
  selector: &#x27;app-child&#x27;,
  templateUrl: &#x27;./child.component.html&#x27;,
  styleUrls: [&#x27;./child.component.scss&#x27;]
})
export class ChildComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor(private cdr:ChangeDetectorRef) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.cdr.detach();
  }
}


&#x60;
The parent component has a data variable which we are showing in that component and also passing it to the child component as Input, and the data is displayed on HTML template other than this we have a button in the parent component to increment the value of data and two buttons in the child component one to detach and other to reattach the change detection, the setup will be as below screenshot

I have been fascinated by WSL architecture since its debut. It has the elegant and beautiful architecture to achieve interoperability between Windows and the Linux world. Eventually, I dive into the WSL Win32 APIs, its registry model, and internal too.
But there was only slight WSL API documentation and sample. Later, I realized that Microsoft does not intend to use the WSL API for general purposes but WSL distribution developers. Also, the CLI tool known as WSL.exe and distro launchers is moving parts (because each Windows 10 major release has different features, command-line options). So these situations make it hard to automate the WSL environment.

                    <span>In this guide I&#x27;d like to show the most important topics and aspects when talking about containerizing a .NET 5.0 WebApi application. There are many articles about it online but no one takes care of all aspects - until now. With this guide you&#x27;d be able to go from zero 0️⃣ to hero 🗻 when talking about containers and .NET 5.0 WebApi.
This articles focuses on building the app inside a Linux container. 
The following topics are going to be considered in this guide:
Configuration
Testing
OpenAPI spec (Swaggerfile) generation
Image size optimizations
Container security
Overwriting defaults
This is the base version we are going to improve step by step in this guide. The major downside is, that there is much more included in the final image than we need for production use.

I have to admit, I am not a fan of AWS Codepipeline. Even now, after a few project where I heavily used CodePipeline, I am still not big fan. For me it is rather simple solution. Of course it can do the job, but in my private world, I used to use TravisCI before and now… Azure DevOps for AWS deployments.
And one of great advantages of Azure DevOps is Artifacts, where you can store and publish your packages. Something what we missed in AWS Codepipeline for long time. Until now.
Not long time ago AWS announced this service. Now it is official. And it is a great news, indeed. Until today we had to use workarounds (let’s call it this way). S3 buckets, or build the artifact solution by our own.
This is not longer needed. AWS CodeArtifact is taking a great place in the CodePipel…</span>

Not only that, backups can also come in handy when migrating data to other systems, for instance migrating a development server into a production environment or vice versa 🔁

                    <span>Greetings and salutations !


Let&#x27;s install Ubuntu terminal on your windows 10 computer.
START button, and type :
Turn Windows Features On/Off
Drag the windows list down and make sure that 
windows subsystem for Linux is checked.
Click Ok, then restart your computer.


 
When you will come back, open your command prompt and type bash, you&#x27;ll find a message tellin&#x27; you that no linux distributions are currently installed, or somehtin&#x27; like that :) 
Go to Microsoft Store, and search for Linux, you will find a lot of distros from which you can choose : Kali, Ubuntu, etc...

Install your desired distro, and you will be ready to rock and roll; let&#x27;s say you installed Ubuntu, you will find Ubuntu&#x27;s terminal app in the start menu; click on that and wait :
Installing, this may take a few minutes...
Once finished, you can start working on your Ubuntu Bash Terminal.
What is Linux ? An operating system ? No!

Basic Bash Terminal Commands:
pwd — When you first open the terminal, you are in the home directory of your user. 
The root is the base of the Linux file system. It is denoted by a forward slash( / ). 



ls — Use the &quot;ls&quot; command to list the files that are in the current directory. 




You can list contents of a a specific folder, let&#x27;s say documents : 
~$ ls \documents
cd — Use the &quot;cd&quot; command to go to a directory. For example, if you are in the home folder, and you want to go to the downloads folder, then you can type in:
~$cd Downloads
~$cd ..
For more Linux commands, watch my Bash commands for beginners.

                    <span>&quot;Hey, have you heard of Emacs?&quot; he said to me, Everything thing changed, every damn thing.


I am quite a beginner in programming and and am just interested in learning new stuff about programming and the most efficient ways to program. My friend is a linux hippie, often peer pressuring me to do stuff the &quot;Linux way&quot;. Recently he told me to try out this tiny editor named Emacs.
Hey, what could go wrong right?
I install the editor. First thoughts: &quot;ew, this looks like notepad but worse&quot;
I&#x27;m getting a hang of the keybindings, although I would much prefer writing code the evil way (evil as in vim).
So for context, I use vim, I quite hated the shortcuts on emacs, so I was ready to leave this editor and go back to vim when my friend suggested I try out doom emacs. &quot;sure, sounds cool&quot; I said
DOOM EMACS IS AMAZING, I love org mode (I know its not exclusive to doom, but still) I love the fact that pressing space and some other keys has some cool secret keybinding (believe me it makes sense while using it), I love the fact that I can use vim keybindings directly in emacs, Doom theme is awesome, the Doom logo made in text in the homescreen is really cool to look at, configuring the editor is made really easy with the packages.el and init.el and config.el.
I need help, I have converted all my dotfiles into org files, I have replaced all my applications with emacs, I use emacs as my email client, I use emacs as my browser, I use emacs as my discord client, I use emacs as my file manager, Please send help, I am addicted to emacs
Help its possesing me
Welcome to the church of Emacs

I have been fascinated by WSL architecture since its debut. It has the elegant and beautiful architecture to achieve interoperability between Windows and the Linux world. Eventually, I dive into the WSL Win32 APIs, its registry model, and internal too.
But there was only slight WSL API documentation and sample. Later, I realized that Microsoft does not intend to use the WSL API for general purposes but WSL distribution developers. Also, the CLI tool known as WSL.exe and distro launchers is moving parts (because each Windows 10 major release has different features, command-line options). So these situations make it hard to automate the WSL environment.
After many trials and errors, I developed a sma…</span>

                    <span>I like simple tools, but now I use Oh My Zsh and PyCharm Professional with some plugins for Git.
PyCharm is a great and powerful tool, but it comes at a price. Yesterday I tried to run PyCharm on my old laptop (Core i3 / 4 GB of RAM), it is completely unusable, just lagging. After that, I decided to change my basic tools to some basic ones, such as bash, git, vim, etc. Because at least I don&#x27;t want to be a slave to my MacBook Pro &#x3D;)

So I want to start one month with just the basic tools. The first month I tried to use old and new tools because I want to be productive at work. After the first mixed month, I will decide what to do next.
The first month begins today (07/10/2021).</span>

                    <span>Tweak your Linux terminal in a minute, without using ZSH.
Copy this line of code:
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diogocavilha/fancy-git/master/install.sh | sh

Open Terminal and paste the copied command there and press enter.

After this command completes, quit your terminal and open it up again.
Voila!

You&#x27;ve already tweaked your terminal!
I&#x27;m not really a fan of this look, so I&#x27;m going to modify it a bit.
There&#x27;s many themes available on the fancygit repository.

I like the fancygit human theme, so I&#x27;d open a terminal and enter this exact command.
Now my terminal looks like this:

But I&#x27;d rather it not show the time.
What are you waiting for, open your terminal, we&#x27;re going to fix it from there.
On your terminal and enter this command:
fancygit --help

A help menu would appear with all the options available for fancygit.

We can see that the command fancygit --disable-show-time would remove the time, so we just copy it and then quit the menu by pressing q and paste the copied command.

Done. We&#x27;re done.

                    <span>Hey all! I made this guide after getting Starship successfully working on Bash, but zsh would refuse to accept the init script.
This step is not required if you&#x27;ve already set a custom password for your Crostini container.
Run sudo passwd user, where user is your username.
...whether it be from your package manager of choice, or from source.
Then, simply run this command to add zsh&#x27;s binary to /etc/shells:command -v zsh | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
Now, set it as your default shell:chsh -s $(which zsh)
Run curl -fsSL https://starship.rs/install.sh | bash to start the installation.
To add Starship&#x27;s init script to your .zshrc file, simply run one last command:echo $(starship init zsh) &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
Enjoy your new beautiful and blazing fast prompt with the power of Rust and zsh!</span>

                    <span>Recently, I&#x27;ve been dabbling in Google Firebase due to its minimal overhead in getting started and relatively simple deployment pipeline. In particular, its support for NodeJS code and HTTPS makes it an ideal candidate for folks who are new to API development and looking for a low-cost option. In this post, I wish to demonstrate from start to finish how to start a NodeJS API, be able to test it, and deploy it to production.
To get started, check to ensure you have the Firebase CLI installed on your computer. To install the Firebase CLI, please follow these instructions. Once you are done, ensure you have installed Firebase version 8.6.0
$ firebase --version 
8.6.0

If you do not have version 8.6.0 installed, you can install this version globally using the following command with NPM:

                    <span>What is REST API?


Nowadays, the word API becomes more and more popular since we are living in the digital era of the Internet. Even if you are not a coder, probably you have heard the word API at least a few times. More importantly, if you are a coder APIs are all around code in many different forms, therefore it&#x27;s good to know something about them. Indeed there are many different types of APIs, and the word API stands for application programming interface, while REST means representational state transfer, and this type of API will be the main focus of this article. Don&#x27;t worry if those words do not mean too much to you at this point. So what are APIs and what do we need them for?

                    <span>Já precisou debugar em Node.js?
Se sim provavelmente você pensou que era necessário fazer toda uma configuração.
Não importa se você usa Sublime, VSCode, WebStorm ou outro editor/IDE, será necessário no mínimo configurar um arquivo.
Bom eu utilizo VIM, não largo por nada rs
Mas voltando pro foco, que tal utilizar o próprio Chrome DevTools como Debug?
É muito fácil.
Se você já tem o Node instalado pode utilizar a flag —inspect-brk para iniciar um Websocket com o Google Chrome. Essa flag adicona um break antes do código ser executado.
Vamos começar com um único

Show, agora vamos entrar no Google Chrome e digitar no campo de url chrome://inspect, o Chrome irá abrir um página com nosso script, clicando em inspect ele irá abrir o DevTools.

Agora com nosso DevTools aberto podemos adicionar break points para conseguir encontrar o erro.

Caso você esteja trabalhando em um projeto grande pode adicionar um script no seu package.json, “dev:debug”: “node —inspect-brk app.js”
Nesse cenário teremos que adicionar a pasta do no projeto na sessão Filesystem em Add folder to workspace, para podermos navegar entre os arquivos e adicionar nossos break pointers.
Espero que esse pequeno artigo ajude vocês no dia a dia com Node.

Fiquem com Deus e até a próxima.

This is my fourth tutorial about using Twitter API with Node JS. My previous tutorials are listed up there 👆.
In my first tutorial, I showed how to tweet with only text using Twitter API and Node JS, see here.
@thomasbnt
 and @generativexbot
 , so here I&#x27;ll explain my way to do this.
You need to have a Twitter Developer account and for the basic configurations please go here for more explanation as I follow the same structure.
To tweet an image, the process will consist of two requests:
The new thing here is that each request uses a different subdomain in the Twitter API url, which means that a small change will be done on the config.js file.



const twitter &#x3D; require(&#x27;twitter-lite&#x27;);

                    <span>I was struggling to find a small JavaScript module to parse CSV (Comma Separated Values) files. All the existing modules have one or more shortcomings:
Do not work in browsers;
Large (all I found are at least 10kb min.js.gz).
Cannot parse to deep objects.
Cannot generate CSV from deep objects.
I&#x27;m pretty sure CSV parsing can be implemented in less than 1Kb min.js.gz. So I did it.
Please meet the powerful lil-csv.
That&#x27;s how large it is (v1.3.1):
       1465 B: lil-csv.js.gz
       1313 B: lil-csv.js.br
       1315 B: lil-csv.modern.js.gz

                    <span>Kali ini, kita akan membahas bagaimana kita membuat aplikasi Node.Js menjadi Production atau Development. Terdapat banyak cara untuk melakukannya, tergantung dengan apa kita akan melakukanya. Kali ini kita akan mencoba melakukan set node_env ke production atau development dengan menggunakan beberapa cara.
Cara melakukannya cukup mudah, yaitu hanya cukup menggunakan command prompt atau power shall, sebelum memulai aplikasi Node.js kita. Berikut beberapa cara untuk melakukan set node_env pada aplikasi Node.Js kita.
Untuk yang menggunakan OS Linux atau unix based system lainnya, dapat menggunakan perintah berikut ini:
export NODE_ENV&#x3D;production

Apabila kita menggunakan OS Windows kita bisa menggunakan perintah berikut ini:
SET NODE_ENV&#x3D;production

Apabila kita menggunakan PowerShell kita dapat menggunakan perintah berikut ini:
$env:NODE_ENV&#x3D;&quot;production&quot;

Kita juga bisa melakukan set di setiap running aplikasi kita dengan menggunakan perintah berikut ini, tapi perintah ini hanya akan berlaku untuk aplikasi tertentu yang sedang kita running tidak secara global. Cara ini dapat digunakan untuk melakukan testing pada aplikasi kita:
NODE_ENV&#x3D;production node app.js

Kebanyakan akan menemui error saat menggunakan perintah di di atas, seperti berikut:
&#x27;NODE_ENV&#x27; is not recognized as an internal or external command

Untuk melakukan set node_env dengan perintah di atas, perlu untuk install dependensi berikut win-node-env, dengan cara menuliskan perintah berikut ini:
npm install -g win-node-env

Cara lain, kita dapat menggunakan package tersendiri untuk melakukan set node_env, yaitu dengan menggunakan package cross-env.
Saat mengubah NODE_ENV ke dalam mode production, semua devDependencies pada file package.json akan diabaikan semuanya saat melakukan running aplikasi. kita juga dapat menggunakan perintah berikut ini:
npm install --production

                    <span>In this post I will teach you how to use mysql with knex.js 😊


Knex.js is a SQL query builder for Postgres, MSSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, Oracle, and Amazon Redshift designed to be flexible, portable, and fun to use. It features both traditional node style callbacks as well as a promise interface for cleaner async flow control, a stream interface, full-featured query and schema builders, transaction support (with savepoints), connection pooling and standardized responses between different query clients and dialects.
Create a folder then enter to it and then type the command bellow:
npm init -y
npm i express knex mysql

Create a file call app.js in your project root and write these codes bellow:
const express &#x3D; require(&#x27;express&#x27;)

const app &#x3D; express()

app.get(&#x27;/&#x27;, (req, res) &#x3D;&gt; {

Till I stumbled on this article, where I started wondering how my folder structure and sam templates were going into the stack. A detailed inspection was not required, though this was the time when I used the GUI ( after a long time ). But the outcome showed how pathetic the condition was.

Well, it is clear that the whole mess is being uploaded into all the function code. What does this mean – holy grail, any one small change here or there, would update all the functions – last modified is the same, all functions will have the node_modules and other artifacts like templates and custom modules.

                    <span>Ao trabalhar com chamadas assíncronas no JavaScript em algum momento você já se deparou com uma promise, talvez até sem saber exatamente que estava utilizando uma, mas por de trás dos panos ela estava lá.
Uma promise é o objeto retornado de uma chamada assíncrona que possui a promessa de um valor, seja ele um valor futuro, imediato ou que nunca existirá. São exatamente estes os estados de uma promise:
pending (pendente): ainda não foi finalizada, mas também não foi rejeitada
fulfilled (realizada): sucesso na operação.
rejected (rejeitado):  falha na operação.
Quando uma promise é realizada significa que a chamada assíncrona foi finalizada e não foi encontrado nenhum erro na sua execução, neste momento ela terá um valor, caso essa chamada seja rejeitada, ela terá um motivo (erro).

Secure enclaves and trusted execution environments are becoming ever more popular. AWS recently released their AWS Nitro Enclaves. But what are they and do I really need them?
Nitro enclaves by AWS are Amazon&#x27;s approach to creating trusted execution environments (TEEs) which are intended to support functions on sensitive data. Amazon by no means invented the concept, and TEEs or secure enclaves have been growing in popularity over the past number of years. Hardware players like Intel and AMD have created physical chips which support TEEs, while cloud platforms like Google and AWS have developed theirs based on virtua…</span>

                    <span>shopify-webhook-commander is a CLI to create, list, and delete Shopify Admin App webhook subscriptions.
Building out a new admin app often requires setting up listeners for Shop events but building out controllers and UI to manage webhook subscriptions isn&#x27;t always at the top of the to-do list.
This CLI will let developers manage subscriptions from the terminal.

🚫 This package is under active development; installer beware.
$ npm i -g shopify-webhook-commander

This tool uses a single token to authenticate; this is easiest with a Shopify &quot;Private&quot; Admin App. Set the config secret to the private app password. There is no OAuth flow to help with &quot;Custom&quot; Partner apps.

Now look, It&#x27;s really important and if you are beginner you may haven&#x27;t face this yet, but you will soon need to decide where should I put my state, either Redux, Context API or Maybe in component state. 
Now in order to manage state, you probably heard about Redux state management library which has centralized state mechanism and Context API.

But which is a best way to manage state, Like should you use redux? 
I have seen lots of beginners just started to learn redux and now they are using Redux everywhere.
You need to decide whether you should go for redux or context API?

Uma promise é o objeto retornado de uma chamada assíncrona que possui a promessa de um valor, seja ele um valor futuro, imediato ou que nunca existirá. São exatamente estes os estados de uma promise:
pending (pendente): ainda não foi finalizada, mas também não foi rejeitada
fulfilled (realizada): sucesso na operação.
rejected (rejeitado):  falha na operação.
Quando uma promise é realizada significa que a chamada assíncrona foi finalizada e não foi encontrado nenhum erro na sua execução, neste momento ela terá um valor, caso essa chamada seja rejeitada, ela terá um motivo (erro).

                    <span>In this tutorial, I explain one workaround that I did to create one Docker image of one Angular application which has one dynamic API URL.
The article How To Build An Angular App Once And Deploy It To Multiple Environments - Solution 4: Override environment file values explains how you can do this.
But, as I&#x27;m far from a Docker expert, I spent some time to create the Dockerfile to do this :)
Just quoting the article:
The idea is to use Angular’s environment.ts (for local development) and environment.prod.ts (for all other stages) with placeholder values which are overwritten per deployment:
export const environment &#x3D; {
  apiUrl: &#x27;MY_APP_API_URL&#x27;,
  stage: &#x27;MY_APP_STAGE&#x27;,
};

If our pod is started we can then run the following script, for example in a Dockerfile, that overrides these placeholder values:
#!/bin/sh
# replace placeholder value in JS bundle with environment specific values
sed -i &quot;s#MY_APP_API_URL#$API_URL#g&quot; /usr/share/nginx/html/main.*.js

Here is the Dockerfile I created to run this workaround:
FROM nginx:latest

COPY dist/your-app-name /usr/share/nginx/html

CMD [&quot;/bin/bash&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, \
&quot;echo API_URL&#x3D;[$API_URL], &amp;&amp; \
sed -i s#MY_APP_API_URL#$API_URL#g /usr/share/nginx/html/main.*.js &amp;&amp; \
nginx -g &#x27;daemon off;&#x27;&quot;]

Build your project:
$ ng build

Place this Dockerfile into your Angular root folder and run this to build your image:
$ docker build -t angular/your-app-name .

After this, just run your container passing the API_URL variable:
$ docker run -p 80:80 --name your-app-name -e API_URL&#x3D;http://localhost:8080 angular/your-app-name</span>

When you have to log, do it consistently.
Logging is necessary. It allows us to debug in both development and production. But console is disallowed by tslint by default. And for good reason. Console logging is a mess most of the time. If you can just willy-nilly console.log(whatever) then your logs are pretty much useless.
We can end up with too much logging in production, which can slow our application down, and not enough in development where we need more details.
I’ve had to deal with this issue on multiple projects and have written a static logger class in Angular that allows us to control what we log and where.
Here is the gist https://gist.github.com/jkyoutsey/e99336d58c2c83bc0ba03cde78fcc64e
In a nutshell you have the following options:

                    <span>After you&#x27;ve upgraded to Angular v12 from a previous version of Angular, you may notice your ng serve times have increased, along with missing sourcemaps, and longer rebuild times during development. This post helps you set a default configuration to development to get your application serving the same as previously.
In Angular version 12, running ng build now defaults to production mode. This is a welcomed change, as there is less chance of accidentally deploying a development build to production, which is a lot slower and bigger, giving the perception that Angular is slow. This also aligns with other web frameworks that build for production out of the box.
The way Angular serves the application, it essentially does a build with watch mode. As mentioned before, doing a build is now done by default with production optimizations enabled. This adds more time to the build process.
There is a migration to add a &quot;development&quot; build configuration.
To run this migration, run:
ng update @angular/cli --migrate-only production-by-default

One caveat is that it only supports migrating first-party Angular builders for development mode, including:
@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server
@angular-devkit/build-angular:protractor
To fix this manually, you add the development options as defaults, and a defaultConfiguration set to an empty string so it doesn&#x27;t default to production.
Now, when running ng serve you will get a development build, which is faster for local development.

Rest we will add stuff as needed and think about it in various scenario&#x27;s as we go. I&#x27;ll add stuff to github repo on Thursday and drop an article on what we did on Friday. Follow along if you want to learn more about Angular.
Github Repo - https://github.com/ajitsinghkaler/devto-clone
Deployed on Firebase - https://dev-toclone.firebaseapp.com/
Right now we have created the header component and next we will create the side bar.

Each commit message will tell what we have done in that commit. Follow alone if you want to learn angular and let me know if any enhancements you think are needed create an issue on the repo if you want we can discuss there.</span>

                    <span>As a product engineer, you likely understand the value of incorporating notifications functionality into your Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
Here&#x27;s what you can accomplish by building notifications:
Drive engagement. Notifications inform customers that there’s something going on in your application that’s worthy of their attention. Timely notifying your audience about valuable content or interactions with other users is great for building trust and engagement.
Enable user journeys based on asynchronous actions. If you don’t expect your users to always be connected to your app or service, notifications enable your users to stay plugged in without having to constantly check for updates in-app.
Support time-sensitive operations. Perhaps you’re planning on requiring two-factor authentication at…</span>

                    <span>This is a tough for myself since I&#x27;m still learning as I go but what I can recollect from what I read. it restructures a function so it takes one argument, then returns another function that takes the next argument, and so on.


Here&#x27;s an example:




function add(x) {
return function(y) {
  return function(z) {
    return x + y + z;
  }
}

}
console.log(add(10)(20)(30));

The add(10)(20)(30) should return 60.
This is useful in your program if you can&#x27;t supply all the arguments to a function at one time. You can save each function call into a variable, that hold&#x27;s the returned function that takes the next argument when it&#x27;s available.</span>

                    <span>The every method works with arrays to check if every element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value true if all values meet the criteria, false if not.


Example, the following code would check if every element in arr is positive.




function check(arr) {
return arr.every(function(num) {
  return num &gt; 0;
})

}
console.log(check([1, 2, 3, -4, 5]));

check([1, 2, 3, -4, 5]) should return false




  
  
  Using the some Method



The some method works with arrays to check if any element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value true if any of the values meet the criteria, false if not.
Ex:

                    <span>In 2011, every aspect of our lives seemed to be moving to the web. Smartphone and tablet use was rising, and the recent completion of the HTML5 specification, together with nice additions such as the web manifest, seemed to pave a path to a bright future. As the hip social network Facebook bet strongly on HTML5 for their mobile application, everything was shipshape.
Then there were some unfortunate setbacks. First, the up-and-coming native app framework PhoneGap did not go anywhere. Facebook then announced they were rewriting their mobile app. HTML5 was not ready yet, they said.
Finally, as Google announced AMP — a subset of HTML5 with some custom elements — no one wanted to bet on HTML as an app platform. Failed experiments such as webOS and Mozilla’s Firefox OS set the transition back ev…</span>

                    <span>First released in 2013, Vue is a progressive framework for building web user interfaces. It’s an adoptable, not monolithic, framework that integrates with other frameworks such as React and Angular. While Vue is focused only on the view layer, it can power single-page applications (SPAs) with ease. This fully open-source project is maintained on its GitHub page.
September 2020’s full release of Vue 3 had significant improvements for developers. Vue 3 is fully backward compatible with Vue 2. It has improved performance, better readability, and several new features.
Today, we’ll examine a few of those features and see how to use them to enhance your development workflow. We’ll also reflect on some workarounds needed to use these features in previous versions of Vue. We’ll cover TypeScript su…</span>

                    <span>Adding a Pantavisor Linux system, middleware or app container from docker is done using our pvr middleware tool.
If you are using Pantavisor Linux with our PVBox frontend you can simply use the pvboxctl &quot;install&quot; command to get this done:

Next you select &quot;Add from docker&quot;

And choose a name:

And finally type the &quot;Docker Source&quot; ref from your preferred docker registry:

And let pvr do the the rest:

Once finished you will have a chance to do some final edits to you app and commit it:
&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;

We have provisioned the following files
for the parts you have selected to edit:


You can now edit part \&#x27;mynewapp\&#x27; and change
them to your liking.

Remember to pvr commit any changes you might
want to apply to your system.

When done, you can:
1. apply committed changes: exit 0 (or Ctrl-D)
2. discard your changes: exit 1

For help visit: https://pantavisor.io

pvctlbox::mynewapp#


Often you can just use the container using the default configuration pantavisor linux generated for you.
Once happy you would run:
pvr add .
pvr commit

and exit the interactive shell (e.g. press ctrl-D) to apply you changes and instruct pantavisor to run the new, modified system that includes your new docker container.</span>

What problems does Docker solve?
What are containers?
What is the difference between a container and a VM?
What is the difference between images and containers?
How does Docker help create applications?
Why Docker?
The need for Docker arises from virtual machines on servers being used at large scales. Take a large business for example. For a business that uses hundreds of servers with a cluster of virtual machines for each of their platforms, maintaining these machines is a full-time job. Each server has to have an OS installed, it needs upgrades and patches from time to time, and then dependencies for the applications each machine uses also have to be installed. 
You can see why this quickly becomes very complex. Manually configuring these servers is not feasible, so …</span>

                    <span>I believe the single-biggest barriers to entry for modern Javascript development are the build tools that are necessary to use it effectively. It’s all a black box, breaks with vague error messages, that ultimately lead you down a tunnel of “google and pray”. Unless you’ve spent a lot of time with Webpack, it’s hard to troubleshoot when it inevitably breaks. (and seriously, who freaking has time to learn all the idiosyncrasies of Webpack?)
But even with that, the benefits vastly outpace the drawbacks. When Javascript build tools work, they work beautifully – compiling your scripts down to the smallest size, ensuring that it works on all web browsers, and in the case of WordPress, even automatically enqueuing dependent scripts that are a part of WordPress core.

                    <span>Middlewares play a very important part in the request-response  lifecycle. The middlewares are placed between the Server and the response.
The main role of middleware is to process the request in the middle before it is received by the Route Handler. The processing could be related to a variety of things such as :
Logging all requests coming to the server (Morgan is a very popular middleware used for this purpose)


To verify if the request has auth token or not (Passcode JS is a popular middleware for this purpose)



These are basically functions that can access request object, response object as well as the next middleware function in the application&#x27;s request-response lifecycle (Next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next).

For this reason, we are very pleased that the learning platform Secure Code Warrior is now integrated into our version management tool SCM-Manager.
An example of well-known security vulnerabilities is SQL injections, where arbitrary code is injected into database queries, allowing unauthorized information to be read (for more on this, see the Wikipedia article).

J’ai utilisé Cockpit CMS un logiciel avec plusieurs de problèmes sécurité. Il y a deux ans j’ai pensé il est le meilleur logiciel pour moi parce que il est simple pour utiliser est il fonctionne avec plusieurs langues aussi. J’ai lis le code et j’ai connu le problème sécurité.
Il y a deux semaines j’ai reçu un émail de un spécialiste sécurité qui piraté mon installation cockpit et demande récompense. J’ai utilisé le récent logiciel encore.
Bloque accès sous mod de pass avec « basic auth » dans Apache.
Change tout des jeton accès et mod de pass pour tout les utilisateurs.
Utilise sauvegarde parce que je ne sais pas si quelques informations être changé avec le piratage.
Change tout le logiciel que j’ai crée de utiliser le nouveau « basic auth » et un Access Token de Cockpit.
Crée security.txt fiches pour tout mon site de web.
Je recherché des option de change cette système avec un logiciel plus sécurité.</span>

Introduction


Hello. Welcome to this week&#x27;s security review. As usual, I am your host Habdul Hazeez.
My inbox is open if you&#x27;d like to send me a message here on DEV. If email is your thing, my email is ziizium @ protonmail.ch. You can also say hi on Twitter @ziizium.
In this week&#x27;s review, most of what we&#x27;ll discuss surrounds software bugs and malware relating to software from Microsoft, Apple, and Google.
Everyone, let&#x27;s start.

Anonymization or pseudonymization are some of the technics commonly adopted to do protect some data. In both case, you want to remove the ability to identify someone and more important the link to his personal information (financial, health, preferences…), while keeping the data practically useful. Anonymization consists in removing any direct (and part of indirect) identifying data. Pseudonymization does not remove these information but modify them so that we cannot m…</span>

YARA is a tool used to help researchers to identify and classify malware. YARA is a multi-platform that supports both Unix and Windows based systems, and it can be used via command line or from python scripts with the yara-python extension. 
Running YARA
To run YARA via command line, run the following the command:

                    <span>VoIP, Voice over Internet protocol, is the future of business communications. Thanks to its versatility, flexibility, and affordability, it is becoming an important part of the business telephony system. VoIP telephony is a clearer, faster, and more comprehensive communication medium for industries of all sizes to run business over the phone, but is it secure?
Considering the rising number of cybercrime around the world, the importance of security has become paramount. Phishing attacks, scam calls, malware, and other unknown security threats have put the business in disastrous situations.
Industries are losing their confidential information and money at alarming rates due to the loopholes, which can be closed with security alternatives.

                    <span>Welcome to the second vue academy ! It will be a list of lot of article on vue! I have 2.5 years of experience in this and I can teach a few thing about this !
For this course we will focus on v-model directive !
First problematic, how do we manage an input value in  ?
We could do the next :

export default {
  name: &quot;HelloWorld&quot;,
  data: function () {
    return {
      message: &#x27;&#x27;,
    }
  },
  methods: {
     updateMessage(event) {
         this.message &#x3D; event.target.value
     }
  },
};




    



We need to bind value of input to our current data message and handle event from this input in order to update our current data message.
It&#x27;s not really friendly and we have to do this for every  component...
You can use the v-model directive to create two-way data bindings on form input, textarea, and select elements. It automatically picks the correct way to update the element based on the input type.
So we can replace the code above by

export default {
  name: &quot;HelloWorld&quot;,
  data: function () {
    return {
      message: &#x27;&#x27;,
    }
  },
};




    



We can remove the method that update value ! Since v-model will directly update it.
It&#x27;s very useful !</span>

                    <span>Very often when working on full stack solutions we find ourselves opening 4+ tabs in our terminal. We would run a yarn dev for on micro-service then a yarn start for react and so on.
This has always been annoying to handle and so we built Child Manager which lets you manager child processes for your project from just a simple config file.
https://github.com/pixiumdigital/child-manager/
To install run the following commands:
yarn add @pixium-digital/child-manager

You can also use NPM
npm install @pixium-digital/child-manager

To leverage child manager simply add a configuration file to your project (see below for config details)
You can run thew following command:
yarn child-manager

By default the loaded config will be at the source of the project and be named childmanager.json

                    <span>React is a cool library to make front end apps. I work with it since 3 years and I&#x27;m not bored to use it !
Composition is very powerful in React but for some cases, it may be hard to use.
Today I will give you examples of composition caught up in real Typescript projects.
Take a very common component, like a button. We have a lot of them in our apps.
Below, a generic component, a button with some props.
const Button: React.FC

                    <span>Functional programming is a programming paradigm that is focused on composing functions together to execute a particular programming task. Many programming languages available today supports functional programming style. Most people would argue that they rather do things the Object Oriented way but i tell you, there is nothing wrong in using a functional programming approach to writing your code. Due to the support we get with most languages we can pass functions as arguments to to other functions, we can also return a function from another function. So the basic idea about using a functional programming approach is to isolate different processes in our code in to reusable functions. Since functional programming is concerned so much with functions, we will look at what functions are and th…</span>

HelpingHand is an open source app that was built to serve exactly one purpose: 
To help people who are in need of it. Every app user signs up on the app platform and then can find themselves open to helping people from various posts that the people have earlier made. This person can then reach out to these people if they feel that the post describes a problem that he/she/they can solve.
But there&#x27;s a catch, if you&#x27;re reaching out to a person you&#x27;ve never interacted before, both of your identities are kept secret, unless the post shares finds you…</span>

Nesse post vou mostrar como implantar um aplicativo angular no azure pelo github-actions.

NodeJs
Angular - CLI
Azure - CLI
GitHub - CLI
e também uma assinatura no Azure
Você pode criar uma conta no azure e consumir os créditos para teste, mas nesse artigo os recursos que irei consumir são gratuítos.
O Coaltime, aplicação fictícia que apresentei no artigo anterior, recebeu permissão para ser continuado e agora precisamos de mais agilidade de implantação devido a contínuas mudanças no código. Outra coisa é que decidimos implantar o aplicativo em um serviço Linux.
Faça download do Coaltime (não clone)

RAID 0 disk arrays are known for relatively high data access time, and that’s why people choose to use them primarily because of the considerable boost in the speed of read and write operations. However, their reliability and fault-tolerance leave much to be desired. Even if one of the drives is out of order, all the data in such a disk array is going to be lost. Recovering the information from this array type is quite a challenge, but even then, all the data you may be able to extract will certainly be damaged.

                    <span>Cryptography is the backbone of distributed ledger technologies like blockchain and other consensus-oriented distributed networks. If you are interested in building decentralized applications, it&#x27;s essential to understand the wallet generation and transaction signing processes. Both of which rely heavily on underlying cryptographic protocols.
In addition to distributed networks, cryptography is a critical component of cybersecurity. With cybercrime on the rise and cyberattacks costing businesses an average of 2.3 Million dollars per malware attack source, it is increasingly important to have your cybersecurity up to par. With the proper use of cryptography, you could save your business big time by ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive information.

1. The app must have a generous free tier. I wanted a personal plan, where you can store your passwords safely across multiple devices without hassle.

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>
