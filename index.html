                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using start or jump scripts for a long time to start up my API and SPA at the same time. With project TYE on the horizon, I thought I would share more about my more simplistic, &quot;poor man&quot;, implementation.
It is important to note, a lot of configuration information is specified ahead of time in different files to make this work. For ASP.Net, the ports are configured in the launch.json and for node, proxy information is set up in a proxy.config.json file. Below is a simple example of the proxy config I use most often to route api requests to the ASP.Net port. It is also good to remember both apps are running locally under localhost.
// proxy config
{
  &quot;/api&quot;: {
    &quot;target&quot;: &quot;http://localhost:5000&quot;,

                    <span>I believe that the reactive form library in Angular is one of the most powerful tools in the framework. Developers can create performant and reactive forms that provide great UI/UX. One part of the reactive form toolkit that I think people often overlook is creating custom validators. In this article I show how to create a custom password field validator and how to use it.
Reactive forms create objects that all inherit from the same AbstractControl. The AbstractControl has an errors object property, which is where I can get or set validation errors for the form or particular control. This errors object contains key value pairs. When using the default built-in validation, these key value pairs are predefined with specific (often boolean) values. That means that I would need to evaluate the …</span>

                    <span>Welcome to the weird notes of a new DevOps and Backend engineer. This is my (quite open) notebook on what was all the stuff I read and learnt. Not necessarily tech, you can just read on and understand what I am rambling on about.
Opentelemetry&#x27;s sentry exporter is pretty cool, even thought it&#x27;s specifically for traces right now, it does its job well.
The sidecar architecture for opentelemetry-collector will work the best for a scenario. The engineers thought out the agent, collector interface pretty good. 
The Traces specification and the TraceID stuff is good too, I just hope there was more sync between the published package and the github repository.
Need to show the instrumentation demo to the lead.
Probably will need to checkout Elastic APM exporters for these traces.
See if sentry can support any logging :)
Checking how opentelemetry trace back the traces by the ID.
WTF is going on with those spans? Why do they provide us with new contexts?
Thanks for listening to the rant.

                    <span>As a scaling software company, we experience periods of unpredictable platform usage spikes which can come from all over the world. This volatility fosters complexity around instance scaling and other core dev infrastructure. If our instances don’t scale properly, our users experience a less performant product. If our servers are too large, it is a waste of dollars.
Hooking into Datadog gave our company newfound and much-needed insights into our AWS infrastructure. Moreover, the alerting functionality built into Datadog’s event monitoring unlocked the ability for us to monitor, investigate, and ultimately resolve issues with our infrastructure. However, although Datadog alerted us to issues, we still had to manually manage our AWS infra. Our goal was to build a platform that could remediat…</span>

Yes, some people want all of them, and you should satisfy that.  But honestly, no one should have to actually read to get the &quot;right&quot; version.  We have plenty of other shit to read, and so do you.
The latest version (or current major)
All the currently supported Long-Term Stable versions (explicit LTS, or latest of all supported majors)
Latest plus all LTS
Here we have pgAdmin. Not the most egregious, but this is also the update process when the running app has already informed you of the latest version.

Some of the subjects discussed are:
How picking Elixir as the backend impacted the project early on as it was maturing.
Hosting the platform in DigitalOcean and Heroku.
How we manage to serve ~500k requests/day.
How we created a Restful API to send batch email through our customer&#x27;s SMTP servers.
How we use Docker and docker-compose together with Github actions for deployment.
What&#x27;s our experience with hiring Elixir developers.

Traditionally an APM tool, Scout has expanded its service offerings to now include error monitoring of web applications for more cohesive and actionable observability insights within a single platform. This new feature supports an overall better user experience by eliminating the need for multiple web-application monitoring services; Scout APM with Scout Error Monitoring offers performance and error insight and alerting within a single, integrated dashboard.
“Scout’s industry-leading performance and, now, error monitoring solutions are essential for developers building performant, cloud-native applications,” says Jason Hable, Scout’s CEO. “We wanted to expand our services to build a more holistic performance and exception monitoring tool to help our customers solve issues quickly and efficiently. By connecting error reporting and performance monitoring data in one platform we provide our customers with the insights they need without paying for the features they don’t.”
Multiple trends and factors have contributed to the growth of both the APM and error monitoring markets in recent years. Companies are experiencing an increased reliance on advanced data analytics and automation as cloud computing and containers become progressively mission-critical.

                    <span>Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized applications and services that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. Kubernetes provides a platform to configure, automate, and manage:
Intelligent and balanced scheduling of containers
Creation, deletion, and movement of containers
Easy scaling of containers
Monitoring and self-healing abilities
Challenges with Previous Technologies


Before Kubernetes there were containers, which became popular because they simplified going from application development to deployment without having to worry about portability or reproducibility. Developers can package an application and all its dependencies, libraries, and configuration files needed to execute the application into a container image. A…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Helm is a great addition to the Kubernetes ecosystem; it simplifies complex Kubernetes manifests by separating them into charts and values. 
Sharing charts has never been easier especially since all the customizable parameters are located separately (values.yaml). The downside of this is that there’s no single place to see the resulting manifest, as it’s usually compiled and installed in a single step - helm install. 
Helm alleviates this with a plugin system that allows you to seamlessly integrate with the Helm flow and easily run custom code that’s not part of the Helm core code which, as we’ll see in the next section, can be written in any language, even Bash.
Let&#x27;s build a simple plugin that prints out some useful information and environment variables that Helm provides.…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


When you are managing Azure DevOps in a large enterprise organization, and you are still using only one Azure DevOps organization account, you are probably hitting some limits or have potential performance issues. Microsoft&#x27;s recommendation is to have around 300 projects in a single Azure DevOps organization account. I have seen Azure DevOps organizations with more than 600 projects that still work.
The solution is to set up a multi-organization structure. Move all the inactive projects to an archive or boneyard Azure DevOps organization account and add an extra Azure DevOps organization account per department.
Next, you need some insights and automation on which projects have no activity anymore. The Azure DevOps Dashboard gives you the basic insights and an API to automate…</span>

                    <span>Designing websites from scratch is hard, costly, and most significantly time-consuming but luckily nowadays we can get pre-design (readymade) templates that are available at no cost similarly as we can get a premium design with modern, creative features &amp; layout.
So, let’s see which kind of a template you must choose and its benefits and downfalls.
To choose the most effective web template you would like to grasp what reasonable website you&#x27;re starting.
The first thing to think about before you decide on a template, is to know what type of website you would like to start, is it something to sell or to share, what reasonable audience you wish to draw in, and how important is creativity within the design and how important is informative design.
As, you would possibly be knowing that there are both free &amp; paid templates available, and no doubt both of them is amazing, but if you&#x27;re a newbie and don’t want to spend because it&#x27;s your portfolio website or blog website then it&#x27;s fine to urge free template but with a free template, there&#x27;s always specific amount compromise attached.
There are certain things or elements that everyone who is trying to find a template should know and must consider.
Pre-design (Readymade) templates can benefit you and your website in many ways.
Let’s Take a glance at what and where pre-design templates fall.
Picking the best web template is vital because your online business website has to be the most effective and inventive to draw in and stand out as best for your audience or customers.
best web template depends on many factors and during this blog you have seen a number of the foremost important factors that anyone who is looking to purchase or looking to acquire a free template must consider.
There are loads of websites available in the market which sell free and premium, basic and modern website templates. All of them offer you certain things and you must consider the best one for you and your website.</span>

A shell is an interface to the underlying operating system. It allows you to execute operations using text and commands, and it provides users with advanced features like being able to create scripts.
So, everytime you want to execute a command you need to type entire command, I think this is one messy thing we need to do each and every time. To boost productivity and to save time for our lazy squad we have something called Fish. So let&#x27;s see what is it all about.

Logging is the process of recording application actions, activities and state to a secondary interface.


Logging is the process of recording application activities into log files. Data saved in a log file are called logs and are usually identified with the .log extension (some people use other extension preferences)



In this article, you will discover how to use - Winston to log your application activities into files instead of logging to the console.
Why do we need to Log application activities you may ask;
Helps us know when something or an issue occurs with our app, especially when it&#x27;s in production mode.
Helps monitor and Keep track of your system activities.
Helps persist data so you can view this data for analysis later

                    <span>Continuing the Node.js ESM content, I&#x27;d like to talk about the comparitively straightforward alternative to using .mjs to get your Node.js applications to run as ECMAScript Modules (ESM) rather than CommonJS: including &quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot; in your package.json.
&quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;


Let&#x27;s assume we&#x27;ve started with the following package.json for a zero (production) dependency application:

  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;apollo-lunar-module&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.0.1&quot;,

                    <span>I love Bear. The only other writing experience I&#x27;ve had that rivaled it was Ulysses. It&#x27;s an absolute joy to use to author content with markdown.
The biggest issue I have with Bear is that it&#x27;s not easy to do anything with the content outside of the application. But in the end, what you&#x27;re authoring within Bear is just markdown (or it can be), and that content should be portable to wherever you can make it most actionable.
Here&#x27;s a guide to get you started in building a workflow around your Bear notes by exporting them to markdown files.
We&#x27;re going to write a single Node.js script that will export notes from Bear into markdown files with frontmatter metadata elsewhere on your machine.
In this specific example, we&#x27;re going to target active notes (i.e. not trashed). And in the frontmatter, …</span>

To download all the resources from a website, we are going to use the website-scraper module. This module allows you to download an entire website (or single webpages) to a local directory (including all the resources css, images, js, fonts etc.). 
Install the module in your project executing the following command in the terminal:
npm install website-scraper

Dynamic websites (where content is loaded by js) may be saved not correctly because website-scraper doesn&#x27;t execute js, it only parses http responses for html and css files.

Have you ever experienced difficulties with a project because you are on the wrong node version? I have! A lot of projects break, or won&#x27;t build,  if you don&#x27;t have the required version. Previously I used to uninstall/install the correct version manually. And it was a pain everytime. And what if you are working on multiple projects that all uses different node versions? This is where NVM comes in handy.
With nvm you can have multiple versions of node installed at the same time, and easily switch between them! In this blogpost I will show you how to install and use nvm.

Nodemailer is a module for Node.js applications to allow easy as cake email sending. The project got started back in 2010 when there was no sane option to send email messages, today it is the solution most Node.js users turn to by default.
To send an email you need a transport object which will include some additions about the email,the recipient,the adress and some other stuff like that.

                    <span>Node.js is one of the Javascript technologies that made Javascript so trendy. But why? This is because it builds high-performing, real-time web apps easily. It can be used for client side programming and server side programming. If you wonder what’s the superpower of this technology for server side programming, or maybe you don’t know what Node.js actually is, then this blog is for you. Here we’ll see the reasons of why you should choose Node.js for server side programming. But before digging to it, let us see the overview of Node.js.
Node.js is an application runtime environment that allows you to write server-side apps built on Chrome’s V8 Javascript engine. It uses event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that make sit lightweight and efficient. And it’s ability to use Javascript on both frontend and backend adds one more benefit for development. Node.js package ecosystem, npm is the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries. Lots of big companies have adopted Node.js in the production environment.

The main inspiration for the Dockerfile in this post comes from Kathleen Juell&#x27;s post How to Build a Node.js Application with Docker.  All credit goes to Kathleen for summarizing these steps so neatly.

Update your server to the latest packages.

Add a non-root user with sudo privileges.

First, install the Google Authenticator PAM module.

Run the google-authenticator binary to create a new secret key (keep this one safe).
google-authenticator

After completing the process, you can scan/enter the code in an Authenticator App.
I&#x27;ve chosen the following settings for this example.
Do you want authentication tokens to be time-based (y/n) y

Do you want me to update your &quot;/home/username/.google_authenticator&quot; file? (y/n) y

                    <span>CompTIA Security+ is the pinnacle cyber protection certification. Security+ certification is in high demand and maintains to serve as a fundamental certification for experts beginning an IT career or others looking to construct a profession in cybersecurity. On top of that, Security+ certification is also authorized using the Department of Defense (DoD) to satisfy Directive 8570.01 -M requirements.

If you’re looking for employment within the government, then it&#x27;s far a required certification. CompTIA Security+ SY0-501 is the present-day Security+ examination and maybe to be had to take till the Spring of 2021. However, the Security+ SY0-601 is scheduled to be launched in October of 2020. If you’re an IT security professional and you’re seeking to decide which certification is nice for you or if you’re simply trying to research extra about every examination, check out the statistics under:
The SY0-501 examination specializes in these talent regions:
• Threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities
The SY0-601 Exam will cover the equal talent regions pondered within the SY0-501. However, some of these areas will consist of extra information. Expect to see changes in the following regions:
• Threats, assaults, and vulnerabilities
• Cloud assist
Also, expect to peer extra overall performance-based questions (PBQs) on SY0-601.
Professionals need to determine to take every examination based on their man or woman&#x27;s needs and timeline. Both assessments will train you on how to recognize and manipulate security threats, but if you’re equipped properly now SY0-501 is the most effective examination to be had until October.
If you can wait till October, the SY0-601 will include updates based totally on the nature of the current cyber protection environment and troubles that cyber protection specialists are combating these days. If you decide to put together for SY0-601 make certain that your examination education is appropriate to that exam!</span>

                    <span>Hi, I was recently doing a project for my portfolio, a React Project with a slightly complex state. Personally, I really love TypeScript and the Redux/Reducer patterns, because they give me a great Developer Experience with TypeScript and a lot of autocompletion available, quite useful in order to not get bit by a bug caused by a typo, and really convenient as I don&#x27;t have to explore files constantly in order to know what are the properties that a certain object should have.
I always prefer to use TS over vanilla JS, so, it makes a lot of sense to try to make use of strict typing, even in a concept app. Also, while vanilla useReducer might not be what most projects use, I still want to share how I found it to be pretty useful in this context.

When it comes to building forms with React, there are tons of possibilities out there in the React Ecosystem. Many libraries have emerged to answer specific needs, and it can be a little bit overwhelming at first: which one to choose? what strategy to adopt? 
Even without using a library, just using pure React, you can basically go two ways: controlled or uncontrolled. We will briefly discuss this, so if you&#x27;re new to React, you might want to start there. 
If you already know all about controlled VS uncontrolled forms, you can skip the first part and jump right to the second one, where I will show you how I like to build my forms today: using react-hook-form, yup and TypeScript. Those tools allow me to quickly build any type of form w…</span>

— Exploit Data Driven Component Layout, Loaded On-Demand in Angular
One of the fun things about being an applied mathematician in front-end development is the never-ending stream of complex, interactive problems that users wish to solve. These range from gamification of business applications to data-driven user experiences. Two interesting applications of the latter topic include dynamic routing through an application and dynamic component layout. Both are examples of user experiences that vary based on factors such as user role and prior uses of the application. In other words, two different users may be presented with an entirely different experience based on both a priori knowledge of the user and how the user interacts with the application in real tim…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
GitHub is a source code and file storage service with version control using git tool. GitHub Pages is a static file hosting service using a public repository.
Travis CI is a deployment service integrated with GitHub.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)

Este é o primeiro post no qual compartilho com vocês algumas das coisas que aprendi no processo.
Note que esta é a visão de alguém que tinha como ferramenta principal para o desenvolvimento de aplicações SPA o Vue.js. Sendo assim minhas impressões em sua maior parte fazem uma comparação com ele. Leve em consideração que são &quot;novas novas impressões&quot; a respeito do Angular. Muita coisa pode mudar conforme minha experiência progride.

Part 1 of our article featured more information on the security aspects for why to use one but in this article, I want to talk more about the &quot;managing&quot; of SSH keys as a reason to use one.
To define which SSH keys have access to your server, each server user has its own directory and within, a folder called .ssh. This folder should have a file called authorized_keys and the purpose of this file is to hold the public key for each SSH key that should have access.
It&#x27;s a very simple system that works great, as it&#x27;s a simple case of adding a new public key on a new line in the file and saving it, (or deleting a line to remove access).

                    <span>Today we&#x27;ll be looking at how to zip up one or multiple files on Linux systems.
In my case, this situation occurred because I wanted to email attach multiple log files.
Let&#x27;s first look at the command itself.
zip options zip_name files

Where this works as follows:
zip: The Linux command to zip things
options: We can pass in arguments for the end zip results
zip_name: The output name, without the .zip part
files: One or more files comma separated
To show you the most simple zip command for one file, we could do this.
zip archive test.txt

This will create an archive.zip in that folder containing the test.txt file.
zip on Ubuntu or Centos


To install the zip command on Ubuntu or Debian systems, you can run the following command.
sudo apt install zip

For CentOS and Fedora systems, you can …</span>

LVM RAID is a method to create a logical volume (LV) which uses several physical disks to improve performance or fault tolerance. Within LVM, physical disks (abbreviated as PV, physical volumes) belong to one volume group (VG).
Although it is much safer to use MD RAID, if you really need to migrate from conventional disks to a RAID system without having to change their file systems, this method can be very useful.

Part 1 of our article featured more information on the security aspects for why to use one but in this article, I want to talk more about the &quot;managing&quot; of SSH keys as a reason to use one.
To define which SSH keys have access to your server, each server user has its own directory and within, a folder called .ssh. This folder should have a file called authorized_keys and the purpose of this file is to hold the public key for each SSH key that should have access.
It&#x27;s a very simple system that works great, as it&#x27;s a simple case of adding a new public key on a new line in the file and saving it, (or deleting a line to remove access).

  Introduction


Coding a TCP Room in about 200 lines, let’s dive into our adventure! TCP is a transmission control protocol which is one of the main protocols of an Internet protocol suite. This simple program helps us learn about sockets and Client Side Architecture! Python in general is a great language to start with from beginners to advanced! And of course, it allows us to create solid applications very fast and easily. For a further challenge, you can also add custom features like chat rooms, commands, roles, send images etc…

                    <span>Web applications play a key role in determining the success of a business. Many companies solely depend on web applications for their business, offering a SaaS product for other customers and also building web apps for internal use.
Yet it’s a fact that many companies don’t know how to keep track of their web application security and improve it.
Content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, Joomla and website builders have made it easy for everyone to create a website. Most of the website owners forget the fact that the attack surface of internet-facing web applications is much wider and that they need adequate security.
Whenever a customer or visitor is on your website you have to make sure that their data is safe.

                    <span>📓 SOC 2 is a technical security audit report from the AICPA that evaluates a tech service business’s cloud security controls.


In the last two years alone, cloud-based cyberattacks more than doubled — even though SaaS spending grew just 18%. 
While these numbers are merely a correlation from a statistical standpoint, it does indicate that if your business stores customer data in the cloud, it’s more important than ever for your business to take measures to secure that data. Especially given SaaS spending is expected to increase an additional 36% between 2020 and 2022. 
A SOC 2 certification from the AICPA is a foundational step that will help every service provider reduce security risks. Below is a guide to SOC 2 compliance requirements and certification.
SOC 2 is an independent audit report that evaluates the security controls a tech service business uses to protect the data they process in the cloud. Possession of a SOC 2 report is considered table stakes in the SaaS industry, as the answers to most security questions a customer may have about their business’s security posture can usually be pulled from this report.
“SOC” stands for “System and Organization Controls” and was created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). SOC 2 is one of three SOC reports, each with different purposes and/or levels of transparency:
SOC 1. Used to audit internal controls relevant to a customer’s financial systems. Report usage is “restricted,” meaning its use is limited to auditors, the service organization, and authorized users.
SOC 2. Used to audit the overall management of customer data. Report usage is also “restricted” the same way SOC 1 is.
SOC 3. The same as SOC 2, but the report is simplified and publicly available to increase transparency.

                    <span>Sometimes when writing an app in React you might have a component that changes its look and logic dramatically depending on provided props. In addition, if a particular prop provided, the other props become either required or restricted. That hidden prop relation can be explained in documentation but if your project uses Typescript there is a great opportunity to utilize what I call &quot;sets of props&quot;.
It&#x27;s usually not the best idea to make buttons look like links and vice versa but let&#x27;s ignore this for the sake of clarity. The code snippet below is so-called Clickable component which can be either a link or a button that shares the same style but has different behavior depending on props.
import { ReactNode } from &#x27;react&#x27;

interface BaseProps {
  children: ReactNode
}

interface AsButtonProps extends BaseProps {
  as: &#x27;button&#x27;
  onClick: () &#x3D;&gt; void
  href?: never
}

interface AsLinkProps extends BaseProps {
  as: &#x27;a&#x27;
  href: string
  onClick?: never
}

type ClickableProps &#x3D; AsButtonProps | AsLinkProps

const Clickable &#x3D; ({ children, as, onClick, href }: ClickableProps) &#x3D;&gt; {
  return (
    
      {as &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;a&#x27; &amp;&amp; (
        {children}
      )}

      {as &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;button&#x27; &amp;&amp; (
        {children}
      )}
    
  )
}

export default Clickable

The component has four props. children is required in any case so it&#x27;s put under the BaseProps interface. Both AsButtonProps and AsLinkProps extended from BaseProps and represent two sets of props. The active set depends on the value of the as prop while the type never for unused props makes sure that Typescript will yell if someone is using a prop which does nothing.
Here is a scheme:

This pattern is obviously not limited to props in React. It&#x27;s widely used in the types of various npm packages. Now you can add it to your arsenal and build reusable components/utils with better API for you and your team.

— Exploit Data Driven Component Layout, Loaded On-Demand in Angular
One of the fun things about being an applied mathematician in front-end development is the never-ending stream of complex, interactive problems that users wish to solve. These range from gamification of business applications to data-driven user experiences. Two interesting applications of the latter topic include dynamic routing through an application and dynamic component layout. Both are examples of user experiences that vary based on factors such as user role and prior uses of the application. In other words, two different users may be presented with an entirely different experience based on both a priori knowledge of the user and how the user interacts with the application in real tim…</span>

                    <span>Best Practices


Forgive me, the Bart Simpson in me couldn&#x27;t resist using &#x27;Best Practices&#x27; once again. Sure, there&#x27;s a lot to say to stamp out “best practice” and I agree with most arguments in the article. Framing something as a best practice is subjective, and it could give the impression of being arrogant. But, as grown-ups, I&#x27;m convinced most of us know how to deal with the term and see why it&#x27;s used. So pick the practices you agree on, which you see as &#x27;best&#x27; practices yourself.
I have the feeling that the importance of API Gateway in a setup is sometimes overlooked. AWS wrote down the practices themselves (also using the term &#x27;Best practices 😉). But IMHO, their documentation is a tad too brief. Also, the documentation lacks a &#x27;WHY&#x27; in general.

                    <span>For a while Ive been interested in not only Rust but WASM but having limited familiarity with many of the languages that can be compiled to WASM I never really had a chance to try it out until recently. Over the last few months though I got the opportunity to learn Rust.
Rust in my opinion is very much like typescript on steroids. While Typescript may enforce types in your code if you happen to pass a string to a type expecting a number things will still compile and may even work as expected still. With Rust this is not the case. If you provide an unexpected type either things will not compile in the first place or your software will crash.

                    <span>Imagine you have a JavaScript code like this:
const someObj &#x3D; { tags: [], packages: [] };
function hasValue(key, item) {
  return someObj[key].indexOf(item) !&#x3D;&#x3D; -1;
}

And you are porting this this into TypeScript. You are trying to follow best practices, like using strict mode. And don’t want to use any and unsafe casts. so you start adding types:
type SomeType &#x3D; {
  tags: (string | number)[];
  packages: string[];
};
const someObj: SomeType &#x3D; { tags: [], packages: [] };

This was easy, but then you hit one issue that you can’t really write type for hasValue without using some sort of casting. This is your best attempt:
function hasValue(key: K, item: SomeType[K]) {
  return someObj[key].indexOf(item) !&#x3D;&#x3D; -1;

Firstly, go to your terminal and navigate to the directory where you&#x27;d like to create your express app, type npx express-generator, hit enter you should see a structure like this automatically generated for you.

                    <span>Query Keys are a very important core concept in React Query. They are necessary so that the library can internally cache your data correctly and refetch automatically when a dependency to your query changes. Lastly, it will allow you to interact with the Query Cache manually when needed, for example when updating data after a mutation or when you need to manually invalidate some queries.
Let&#x27;s quickly have a look what these three points mean before I&#x27;ll show you how I personally organize Query Keys to be able to do these things most effectively.
Internally, the Query Cache is just a JavaScript object, where the keys are serialized Query Keys and the values are your Query Data plus meta information. The keys are hashed it in a deterministic way, so you can use objects as well (on the top le…</span>

Node.js installation steps depend on your system — just proceed to a download page and follow instructions.
npm doesn&#x27;t need any installation because it comes with Node. If you wish to check that everything is properly installed on your system, follow these instructions.
Sidenote: npm is not the only package manager, there&#x27;s also Yarn. If uncertain, I&#x27;d recommend staying with npm.

I just can&#x27;t stop writing these generic functions! This is another powerful generic function that follows my previous post on building a generic function to update an array at a specific key according to a specific test value. As I try and maintain the cleanest codebase as possible for ReduxPlate, I continue to find new use cases for these easy-to-use yet powerful generic functions.
Often when doing state modifications, you want to merge or add some properties to an object that you get from an API or some other source. You could explicitly write key / value assignments for the keys that you want to update... or you can leverage JavaScript&#x27;s built in Object.assign function and TypeScript&#x27;s generic capabilities to only write one such function fo…</span>

                    <span>Magic is just science that we do not understand yet
...Arthur C. Clarke
This article is part of what I call the magical directives series. In this series, we will unravel the mystery behind some interesting Angular directives. Afterwards, we can add this little magic to our tool box. I call them magical directives because they play a very important role in building reusable components across our Angular applications.
Below are the directives that we will be looking at in this series.
ng-template
ng-container
ng-content
*ngTemplateOutlet
The ng-template directive simply represent an Angular template. Angular uses the ng-template under the hood in our structural directives( *ngIf, *ngFor) and ngSwitch. The ngSwitch controls the structural directives (*ngSwitchCase and *ngSwitchDefault ) and …</span>

                    <span>As awesome as flexbox is, what it’s doing under the hood is actually a little strange because, by default, it is doing two things at once. It first looks at the content size which is what we would get if by declaring width: max-content on an element. But on top of that, flex-shrink is also doing some work allowing the items to be smaller, but only if needed.
Let’s break those two down and see how they work together.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
