                    <span>The how we did it is paramount, in manifesting goals into reality.



Measure twice and cut once.

We wanted the absolute best developer experience for the users. So, we settled after a few trials on a process that worked well for us.
I set up working sessions between the component dev and myself.
Every component started with its own markdown file to document the design.
We put down the ideal developer usage and experience, for the component.
We referenced our existing version, component tickets history and industry leaders.
The states and interactions were then considered.
Once satisfied, we sought feedback from the rest of the dev team.
We also sought the feedback of some key dev community members.
The final design would then be honed, ready for coded implementation.

                    <span>In recent times, if you were a C# developer who wanted to build code for browsers, you had to resort to JavaScript, the most widely used programming language in the world. However, the web development industry is rapidly evolving, and developers no longer need to rely on JavaScript to create high-end online apps. Blazor is making it possible to run.NET in the browser without the need for add-ons or plugins, due to a technique called WebAssembly.
This blog will examine the current status of Blazor, its features, and its preparedness for production use, before comparing it to one of the most popular frameworks, Angular.
Here is why you should choose Angular for your next web development project.

As a new engineering manager, your first 90 days are crucial . You quickly realize the need to gain trust while rapidly building relationships and rapport ‚Äî not only with your colleagues and your direct reports, but also with all the other discipline stakeholders. As an engineer, you spend 80% of your time with your engineering team, focusing on the engineering aspects of your role. But in a management position, you spend perhaps 50% of your time with your fellow engineers. The other 50% of your time is spent with people who are stakeholders representing cross-functional disciplines such as product, design + UX or the QA department if there is one.

Sample Trust policy for the IRSA role. 
{


Assume a demo namespace has two IRSA roles create with trust policy system:serviceaccount:demo:*
IAM Role 1 - ServiceAccount01 - access to S3 
Pod1 with ServiceAccount01 can access Role 2 just by exporting the AWS_ROLE_ARN &#x3D;  so that it will get access to S3 and DynamoDB .
EKS supports IRSA roles for the aws-node daemonset, it is security best practice to use IRSA role instead of system node role. 
Update the pod spec with automountServiceAccountToken&#x3D;false attribute if there is no need for the application to access EKS Control plane API.</span>

Modern applications base more and more on micro-services. Splitting large applications into smaller pieces makes the whole more maintainable and easier to develop. However, instead of developing a big monolith, we work on a bunch of tiny applications, making it more challenging to debug and deploy the whole system. Luckily, there are many tools out there to help us out. An interesting comparison of some of them can be found here. In what follows, we want to see how easy it is to do Kubernetes-based development with devspace.
Suppose we are developing a micro-services application, for example an e-shop. In essence, our e-shop consists of a frontend application that communicates with a backend through an API. For the sake of simplicity, let&#x27;s say ‚Ä¶</span>

This is great because you can get releases out there, see the changes and get the updates. But security is typically being left behind, and there are a number of challenges facing agile security.
Increasing regulations like the New York CRR 500, and BaFin in Germany are enforcing timely verification and risk-based approaches. With a need for more frequent and automatable checks, how do we make sure we understand the impact as well as the vulnerability?
With more and more high profile breaches, clients today demand to know the risks from their software supply chain. This challenges security, development and DevOps teams to shift left, to have software security checks in their SDLC ‚Ä¶</span>

When a Scaleway Elements API Key is saved in Gitlab, we face all the security issues of storing credentials outside of the cloud infrastructure: Key rotation, age, destruction, location, etc.
There are 2 common reasons for developers to store GCP credentials in Gitlab CI:
They use shared runners.
They use specific/group runners deployed in a Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule cluster but do not use (or do not know about) Gitlab additional configurations.
The alternative that Gitlab CI proposes for users is to mount a secret volume to the runner pods that are created for each build.

                    <span>With the ever increasing adoption of moving workloads to public cloud providers like AWS, satisfying regulatory compliance has emerged as one of the most demanding requirements for businesses that operate on the cloud.
As an AWS customer, this means that you need to establish a proper governance model for your business operations to continue, particularly for those that operate under specific regulations. This &quot;model&quot;, is conceptualised under AWS Control Tower as a collection of guardrails. A guardrail is simply a rule that describes what is allowed or disallowed in your AWS account. Now, a guardrail can be of two forms, a preventive guardrail or a detective guardrail.

                    <span>Recently (2 September 2021) I started using Linux. On my home PC I removed windows and installed Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS. But as

a new user I have to face some challenges to make myself used to this open-source operating system.
One of the very first challenges I faced was making sure I can connect to the internet using my D-Link DWM-157 modem.
After doing some google search I came to know about ‚ÄòModem Manager GUI‚Äô and I was so happy. Opened my terminal and simply typed:
sudo apt-get update


Someone was smiling behind the scene and was whispering not so easy boy! Prepare for the next hurdle.
I was so happy it is a very nice GUI, everything is here for me i just a single click away to check anything. Everything was working perfectly in the GUI except the USSD code !

                    <span>So, now that Docker Desktop is paid under certain scenarios, you may want to switch to something else.
This is a straight to the point guide on how to make Docker CE run fully on WSL2.
PS: the title says right way, but it is just my personal opinion. I am not claiming that any other guide does it in a wrong way.
A full-fledged Docker installation on WSL2
Docker Daemon automatic start without any crazy hacks
Docker Daemon sharing between Windows and WSL (i.e. you cannot run docker from Windows PowerShell)
Docker Daemon sharing between WSL distributions
I will consider that you already have WSL2 working, and you are using Ubuntu as your distribution.
Install Docker CE on Ubuntu by following the official guide:

All modern motherboards come equipped with an integrated RAID controller, and top models may have several such controllers on board. That‚Äôs a different question, though, if such integrated controllers in consumer-class motherboards are ever used by an average user.

                    <span>A password manager is a computer program that allows users to store, generate, and manage their passwords for local applications and online services. A password manager assists in generating and retrieving complex passwords, storing such passwords in an encrypted database, or calculating them on demand. For the past seven years &quot;123456&quot; and &quot;password&quot; have been the two most commonly used passwords on the web. The problem is, most of us don&#x27;t know what makes a good password and aren&#x27;t able to remember hundreds of them anyway.

It looks like your application can&#x27;t read the environment variable properly.
I don&#x27;t know which package you are using to load environment variables but the simplest way is using dotenv package.

                    <span>Programming is just one big cycle. Create or download a project, install your dependencies, build something amazing, and move on to the next one. However, with node.js projects, there&#x27;s a glaring problem.
Every time you move on to another project, you leave incredible amounts of data in the node_modules folder that you may never use again. This can add up... quite quickly.

Don&#x27;t despair! There&#x27;s an easy fix, and it&#x27;s called npkill.

Clear space: Get rid of old and dusty node_modules cluttering up your machine.
Very fast: NPKILL is written in TypeScript, but searches are performed at a low level, improving performance greatly.
Easy to use: Say goodbye to lengthy commands. Using npkill is as simple as reading a list of your node_modules, and pressing Del to get rid of them. Could it be any easier? ;)
Minified: It barely has any dependencies.
You don&#x27;t really need to install it to use it‚Ä¶

It&#x27;s an easy CLI that provides a user friendly interface to scroll through all of your node_modules folders, and, if necessary, delete some at the click of the button.
Personally, I think it&#x27;s an incredibly cool and useful tool, and I&#x27;m sure you will too! To get started, just type:
npx npkill

And start freeing space!</span>

So you want to develop using the Javascript run-everywhere platform in the same computer in which you game, edit videos, code C# desktop apps or whatever. You are also aware that there are multiple node.js versions in active development and it is fairly common to find projects in the wild that only run in a handful of them. Then this guide is for you, let&#x27;s set up a Windows machine for node.js version with multiple version management, while also addressing common pitfalls.
If you are using Windows 11, good news: you already have the Windows Terminal installed. If not, open the Microsoft Store and download it free of charge.

Now, instead of installing node.js from the official website, we should install the Node Version Manager and download node versions from there. In case you alr‚Ä¶</span>

We recently moved our application stack towards Kubernetes. While we immediately benefited from its advantages, we suddenly lacked centralized application level logs for our NodeJS microservices. Previously our Express API was perfectly capable of providing this data on its own. Now it became a lot trickier to aggregate this when multiple pods ran simultaneously. 
This triggered a web search for the ideal tool(s) to give us a better understanding on performance and also any errors that would occur. Given we are a startup (www.bullswap.com), we gave preference to a cloud-agnostic, open source solution and that is how we ended up looking at elas‚Ä¶</span>

There are many ways to avoid relative imports in Node.js. One of them is either:
Add NODE_PATH&#x3D;./ env ( reference )
Set &quot;baseUrl&quot; in (js|ts)config.json ( reference )
Use require.main.require ( reference )
Directly write into node_modules ( reference )
Use NPM/Yarn workspaces  ( reference )
There are many downsides to each approach.
Adding an environment variable requires adding cross-env NODE_PATH&#x3D;./ to all package.json scripts and every time you need to run the script yourself. This behavior is also somewhat unreliable during my testing, also VSCode Int‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Hello everyone, my name is Dustin. Today, I wanted to talk about the experience of refactoring my entire code written in Nodejs and rewriting history in Git.
To be honest, I didn&#x27;t think that it would be that difficult until I broke the whole thing. I literally had to rewrite everything from scratch. I mean not everything but everything. So first off, I had to create a readPath class which mainly will get the path from main to check if it is a folder or other files: .txt, .md, or .json so that I can use different method for different file types. After that, I need a produceFile class, which is going to help me in creating html file and a produceFolder class, which just helps me create a folder in the root directory where the user is sitting at. 
Before using classes
here
After using classes
here
And the code is well organized and easy to read even if for beginners who are used to object-oriented programming.
Thanks to the assignment, I got a chance to learn more about rebasing, amending as well as using classes in Javascript.

The delivery of healthcare services has gone through an unprecedented transformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has accelerated the move to a digital-forward model and elevated trends that were previously slow to be adopted. In addition, the final rule of the 21st Century Cures Act, effective June 30, 2020, implements provisions to ‚Äúadvance interoperability and support the access, exchange, and use of electronic health information‚Äù.
Technology leaders in the healthcare industry will drive positive business outcomes by continuing to innovate in ways that meet the demands of consumers while also meeting security‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>In this blog we are going to see the security best practices for EKS cluster related to IRSA roles and service account tokens. 
Sample Trust policy for the IRSA role. 
{


Assume a demo namespace has two IRSA roles create with trust policy system:serviceaccount:demo:*
IAM Role 1 - ServiceAccount01 - access to S3 
Pod1 with ServiceAccount01 can access Role 2 just by exporting the AWS_ROLE_ARN &#x3D;  so that it will get access to S3 and DynamoDB .
EKS supports IRSA roles for the aws-node daemonset, it is security best practice to use IRSA role instead of system node role. 
Update the pod spec with automountServiceAccountToken&#x3D;false attribute if there is no need for the application to access EKS Control plane API.</span>

                    <span>The speed of software development today allows us to get products to market at a faster pace than ever before. This is great because you can get releases out there, see the changes and get the updates. But security is typically being left behind, and there are a number of challenges facing agile security.
Increasing regulations like the New York CRR 500, and BaFin in Germany are enforcing timely verification and risk-based approaches. With a need for more frequent and automatable checks, how do we make sure we understand the impact as well as the vulnerability?
With more and more high profile breaches, clients today demand to know the risks from their software supply chain. This challenges security, development and DevOps teams to shift left, to have software security checks in their SDLC ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>At our core, you probably know that we are a company specializing in detecting secrets (if you don&#x27;t know what a secret is, please take a moment here and come back).
what would be a good way to categorize secrets?
Take a look at this:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID &#x3D; A3T6AKIAFJKR45SAWS5Z
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY &#x3D; hjshnk5ex5u34565d4654HJKGjhz545d89sjkjak

connect_to_db(host&#x3D;&quot;136.12.43.86&quot;, port&#x3D;8130, username&#x3D;&quot;root&quot;, password&#x3D;&quot;m42ploz2wd&quot;)

You can spot the difference: the first one is tied to a well identified service, AWS, while for the second, things are a bit blurrier: we immediately understand that it has to do with a database connection, but, without further context it doesn&#x27;t tell us what doors it opens.

When a Scaleway Elements API Key is saved in Gitlab, we face all the security issues of storing credentials outside of the cloud infrastructure: Key rotation, age, destruction, location, etc.
There are 2 common reasons for developers to store GCP credentials in Gitlab CI:
They use shared runners.
They use specific/group runners deployed in a Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule cluster but do not use (or do not know about) Gitlab additional configurations.
The alternative that Gitlab CI proposes for users is to mount a secret volume to the runner pods that are created for each build.

                    <span>With the ever increasing adoption of moving workloads to public cloud providers like AWS, satisfying regulatory compliance has emerged as one of the most demanding requirements for businesses that operate on the cloud.
As an AWS customer, this means that you need to establish a proper governance model for your business operations to continue, particularly for those that operate under specific regulations. This &quot;model&quot;, is conceptualised under AWS Control Tower as a collection of guardrails. A guardrail is simply a rule that describes what is allowed or disallowed in your AWS account. Now, a guardrail can be of two forms, a preventive guardrail or a detective guardrail.

jsBarcode ver.3.11.5
I can use jsBarcode in Node.js projects.

I can add options.

The devs involved had the chance to choose the tech stack that we considered convenient, and we collaboratively wrote an RFC (Request for Comment) and presented it to the rest of the company to open up our choices to discussion.
One of the main points that came up -after settling for React, the lingua franca framework at our company- is how we would handle state management. Our main application uses Redux, but many other alternatives were brought up: MobX, using native hooks (a combination of useReducer + useContext), using Redux plus Redux Toolkit.

Even there are many other links which provide same solution.
Now after this implementation, if I made check in code, if the meta tag is added then worked. Even, if I inspect in browser I can see the meta tag in script.

                    <span>What is DevSecOps?


DevOps is now the default approach to agile software development and deployment in most tech companies. With the promise of speed and quality, it seamlessly integrates the functions of development and operations teams to ensure that applications can be continuously pushed out to production. However, the emphasis on speed often comes at the cost of security. Critical vulnerabilities are addressed only late in development, with security patches often being tacked on right before deployment. This is where DevSecOps, also known as Secure DevOps, comes in.
Simply put, DevSecOps is the future of DevOps. DevSecOps involves integrating application security testing earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This notion of shifting security to the left is commonly cal‚Ä¶</span>

awk is a powerfull command line tool found included in all modern GNU/linux distributions. It is often excluded from beginner level Linux tutorials, where more fundamental commands like cd , pwd, ls etc are given more priority, and rightfully so. One must have a good grasp on the basic commmand line tools in order  to harness the full power of awk. 
awk in essence is a pattern scanning and processing language, emphasis on the language part because awk possesses functionality akin to most mainstream programming languages. 
awk loves tabulated data. So to begin with, you&#x27;ll need a piece of text represented as columns delimited by some common character. You see this pattern often in shells, for instance, the ls -l command that prints file information delimited by a space :

API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface. The expansion of the term API may sound a bit complex initially. You may wonder what precisely the Application Programming Interface means? In layman terms, API is a service that allows two or more applications to talk to each other even when they don&#x27;t speak the same language. An API is an abstraction that allows a way to exchange data between applications written in any language.

First, lets create an object to store our routes callbacks. The key of the object is a join of method + path and the value is the route callback. For example:
type RouteHandler &#x3D; (params: Record) &#x3D;&gt; void

const routes: Record &#x3D; {
  &#x27;get::/&#x27;: () &#x3D;&gt; console.log(&#x27;Get on /&#x27;),

                    <span>There are often times when we are building websites that leverage the benefits of being delivered on a CDN (security, performance, no backend infrastructure required), and we want more powerful, dynamic functionality. The best way to increase functionality is through APIs; i.e. email contact forms, processing of outside data, or present information like the weather forecast, flight schedules, currency exchange rates etc. How would we make these API integrations quickly and securely if we do not want to build out a backend or add infrastructure to handle these API calls? Where do we secure the private API keys? What if we don&#x27;t want user authentication prior to allowing our users to interact with the 3rd party APIs?

You can use Auth0 to create and maintain your own user store while also providing a secure authentication system on top of it. Auth0 lets you store users in your own database. Furthermore, Auth0 uses OAuth 2.0 as an authorization framework with which you can be confident in terms of security. Using a custom database as a user store in Auth0 facilitates user migration and adds an OAuth and OpenID Connect layer to your existing user database. You can configure any database or web service, including ASP.NET Membership Provider, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, as an Auth0 custom database. In this article, you will learn how to set up PostgreSQL as a custom database for Auth0.

Typescript is a strongly typed programming language like Java or C and typescript compiles into javascript so that we can use it in our browser or other platforms.

Typescript provides a complete type system so that ide/text editors eg.vs code can give you better autocompletion on your whole project and increase your productivity.

For adding typescript we will need to add a loader and install some dependencies!
We will install ts-loader that will handling .ts file!
We need to add tsconfig.json (ts-loader will use it for transpiling ts file into js file).
After this we will remove all file in our src/ in order to add index.ts (expect html file).
We need to use ts-loader in our webpack config!

The destroyAfterEach Angular testing module teardown option addresses several long-standing issues when using the Angular testbed:
The host element is not removed from the DOM until another component fixture is created
Component styles are never removed from the DOM
Application-wide services are never destroyed
Feature-level services using the any provider scope are never destroyed
Angular modules are never destroyed
Components are destroyed 1 time less than the number of tests
Component-level services are destroyed 1 time less than the number of tests
The two first issues have the biggest impact when using Karma which runs the component tests in a browser.

Overview of AngularJS

It is undoubtedly a largely used JavaScript framework that allows you to execute client web apps in browsers and create native apps. Angular apps consist of various components written with TypeScript or JavaScript. These are decorated with directives for handling things such as binding the HTML or markup to data. Your codes written with Angular will not run directly on web browsers. Therefore, you need compilers to change your code to something which the browsers can easily run.
As Angular 9 uses the Ahead-of-time compiler for transforming the code as a part of the publishing process, the browser can ea‚Ä¶</span>

A very clever malware designed with 3 components: - trojanized applications, - backdoors, and - rootkits. üêû
It employs a rootkit to conceal its presence and uses different command and control servers for each sample, maintaining a low profile on your system as if nothing is happening will it cause havoc.
It is designed to launch and mediate access to a local SSH server, update itself, and transmit collected credentials. üîí
FontOnLake is capable of file manipulation, updating itself, and uploading and downloading files
It accepts remote connections, serves as a proxy and can download and run Python scripts, in addition to exfiltrating credentials.
Surprisingly, this malware targets the one who is immune to most viruses, Linux

                    <span>In this blog post we are going to be deploying a Nextjs application to an SSH server using GitHub action.
step 1:
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-yarn

step 2:
   &quot;build&quot;: &quot;next build &amp;&amp; next export&quot;,

Adding the next export enables next to build and store them in out folder, containing the static html of your app.
Note you can&#x27;t using next methods like getServerSideprops or next image optimization with next export.
step 3:
name: nextjs-blog
on:
  push:
    branches: main
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    name: Build and deploy next site
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.1

      - name: Install Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: &#x27;13.x&#x27;

      - name: Install Project Dependencies
        run: npm install



      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Verify build
        run: ls -la out

      - name: copy file via ssh key
        uses: appleboy/scp-action@master
        env:
          HOST:  XXXXXXXXX
          PORT:  XXXX
          USERNAME:  XXXX
          PASSWORD: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        with:
          source: &quot;./out&quot;
          target: &quot;/var/www/html/nextjs-blog&quot;
          strip_components: 2 # this is important

                    <span>Merhabalar, bug√ºn benim de kar≈üƒ±la≈ümƒ±≈ü olduƒüum ufak bir sorunun √ß√∂z√ºm√ºn√º sizlere sunacaƒüƒ±m. Umarƒ±m faydalƒ± olur.
Bu hata ile kar≈üƒ± kar≈üƒ±la≈üanlar genelde a≈üaƒüƒ±daki iki komutu √ßalƒ±≈ütƒ±rdƒ±ƒüƒ±nda kar≈üƒ±la≈ümakta:
hostnamectl
timedatectl
Komutlar √ßalƒ±≈ütƒ±rƒ±ldƒ±ƒüƒ±nda ise a≈üaƒüƒ±daki gibi bir output d√∂nd√ºrmekteler.

Bu sorunu √ß√∂zebilmek i√ßin √∂ncelikle dbus adlƒ± servisin √ßalƒ±≈ütƒ±ƒüƒ±ndan emin olunmalƒ±dƒ±r.
systemctl status dbus

Eƒüer bu komut sonrasƒ± d√∂n√ºt a≈üaƒüƒ±daki gibi ise servisin bulunmadƒ±ƒüƒ±nƒ± s√∂ylemektedir.

Bu durumda a≈üaƒüƒ±daki komut ile servis y√ºklenir:
apt install dbus

Sonrasƒ±nda servis otomatik olarak active hale gelmi≈ü olabilir. Yine de kesinlik kazandƒ±rmak i√ßin servisi ba≈ülatmalƒ± ve &quot;enable&quot; hale getirmeliyiz. B√∂ylelikle makine her ba≈üladƒ±ƒüƒ±nda √ßalƒ±≈üƒ±r duruma gelebilmektedir.
systemctl start dbus
systemctl enable dbus

Eƒüer &quot;systemctl status dbus&quot; komutunun d√∂n√ºt√º a≈üaƒüƒ±daki gibi ise servis bulunmakta fakat aktif olmadƒ±ƒüƒ± anlamƒ±na gelmektedir.

Servis aktif edilir:
systemctl start dbus

B√∂ylelikle dbus servisi sorunu √ß√∂z√ºmlenmi≈ü olur. Eƒüer bu i≈ülemlere raƒümen √ß√∂z√ºm saƒülanƒ±lmamƒ±≈ü ise bunun sebebi /var/run ile /run arasƒ±ndaki gerekli symbolic linkin bozulmu≈ü olmasƒ± olabilir. Bunun i√ßin a≈üaƒüƒ±daki komutlar √ßalƒ±≈ütƒ±rƒ±lƒ±r ve servisin durumuna bakƒ±lƒ±r:
sudo rm /var/run -R
sudo ln -s /run /var
sudo reboot</span>
