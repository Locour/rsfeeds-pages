I remember in the past when it was possible to create an email address within a few minutes, and you did not have to worry about your personal or private information being compromised because many services at that time didn&#x27;t actually require you to disclose personal information, same as today.
Frankly speaking, I have nothing to hide as a person; but since I&#x27;m a liberal person, I take those things very seriously.

                    <span>Displaying the app version automatically pulled from package.json is a great way to ask clients and users to verify what version they are using.  It is also helpful to include it in error logging.  In previous versions of Angular it was as easy as doing this inside your environment.ts files:
import { version } from &#x27;../../package.json&#x27;;

However in Angular 12 you get an error:
Error: Should not import the named export &#x27;version&#x27; (imported as &#x27;version&#x27;) from default-exporting module (only default export is available soon)
export const environment &#x3D; {
  ...
  VERSION: require(&#x27;../../package.json&#x27;).version,
};

And there is a good chance you will need to add this to your tsconfig.app.json:

Hi All
I am an avid user of ZEN for over 10 years now and it works for me.

But it seems that Intersystems are no longer actively developing it (or ZEN Mojo), the only published reference to this¬† is¬†here
As an aside, Intersystems makes fine products (I have been using the technology for 35 years) and has great support BUT they are not good at being open with their product road map/retirement plans.¬† This is very embarrassing¬† to me when talking with my end user clients.


So I am looking at how to replace ZEN - this is not a short term project, at one client I have over 800 ZEN pages.

And it&#x27;s such a shame as ZEN works and, most importantly, I and the team know how to make it &quot;sing and dance&quot;.

                    <span>Have you ever wanted to use React components in an Angular application ? Or to start migrating an Angular app to React component-by-component ? Or simply use both at the same time ?
I developped ngx-react which allows you to do just that with ease.
It enables you to use your Angular components in React, and vice versa, quite transparently, and without boilerplate.
Just declare a bridge, somewhere in your application:
import { NgxReactBridge } from &#x27;ngx-react&#x27;;

export const bridge &#x3D; new NgxReactBridge()
    // bridge options:
    .addProvider(/** Add a global react provider here */);

Then, to use an Angular component in React, just import it like that:
const AsReact &#x3D; bridge.toReact(MyAngularCommonent);

// use it üëâ  

The generated ‚öõÔ∏è component will take as props all the @Input()s of your üÖ∞Ô∏è component, and all the @Output()s, mapped to functions. (i.e. @Output() onThing: EventEmitter will be mapped to prop onThing: (event: string) &#x3D;&gt; void.
To use a React component in Angular, you&#x27;ll have to do a tiny bit more work... for instance if you have a React component:
function MyReactComponent(props: {
  data: string;
  dataChange: (evt: string) &#x3D;&gt; void;
}) {
    // [...]
}


Then magically convert it to its Angular counterpart like that:
@Directive({ selector: &quot;my-react-component&quot; })
export class MyReactComponent_Angular extends reactBridge.toAngular(
  MyReactComponent
) {

  // a bit of extra work: You will have to map the properties yourself 
  @Input()
  data!: string;
  @Output()
  dataChange &#x3D; new EventEmitter();
}

(the Angular compiler doesnt allow to build dynamic components... so we have to declare them statically)
Just inject Angular services in React like that:
const service &#x3D; useService(MyAngularService);

I&#x27;ll write more about this when I have more time üëâ But please share your thought if you have some :)

This article explains how to manage subscriptions in Angular components without repeating the same teardown logic in each component.
There are two common ways to manage RxJS subscriptions in Angular components to prevent memory leaks:
@Component({
  selector: &#x27;interval&#x27;,
  templateUrl: &#x27;./interval.component.html&#x27;,
})
export class IntervalComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  // initialize &#x60;Subscription&#x60; object
  private readonly subscriptions &#x3D; new Subscription();

  ngOnInit(): void {
    // add all subscriptions to it
    this.subscriptions.add(
      interval(1000)
        .pipe(map(i &#x3D;&gt; &#x60;&#x3D;&#x3D; ${i} &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x60;))
        .subscribe(console.log)
    );

    this.subscriptions.add(
      interval(2000)
        .pipe(map(i &#x3D;&gt; &#x60;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; ${i} &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x60;))

                    <span>While we wait for a regex type in TypeScript, starting on TypeScript 4.1 we can make use of a very neat trick to create string patterns validations which can come in handy for some simple use cases.
I&#x27;m using Leonardo Victor&#x27;s approach to query endpoints in multiple APIs using the Angular HttpClient.
By making use of string patterns I&#x27;m able to validate the urls to some extent.
type ApiAlias &#x3D; &#x27;my-api&#x27; | &#x27;third-party-api&#x27; | &#x27;another-api&#x27;;

type ApiUrl &#x3D; &#x60;@${ApiAlias}/${string}&#x60;;

const MY_ENDPOINT: ApiUrl &#x3D; &#x27;@my-api/myendpoint&#x27;;

const ANOTHER_ENDPOINT: ApiUrl &#x3D; &#x27;@thirdparty-api/anotherendpoint&#x27;;

TypeScript Playground
ANOTHER_ENDPOINT will throw an error because thirdparty-api has a typo. It&#x27;s missing a hyphen, and should be third-party-api.
Go check out Leonardo Victor&#x27;s post if you&#x27;re interested in this implementation!

                    <span>Everything created was created to solve a problem. So why was Angular created in the first place? What problems was it created to solve?
Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework, developed and maintained by Google. It offers an easy and powerful way of building frontend web-based applications.
When Google released Gmail in 2004, it showed the world that web apps really could replace complex desktop applications. Google even open-sourced the Closure toolkit - a set of libraries and an optimized compiler that it used to build Gmail.
However, the problem was that Google&#x27;s Closure tools weren&#x27;t very developer-friendly. They relied heavily on Java, which alienated web developers at the time who were used to working with JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and Python.

                    <span>Hello! Today we will deploy a serverless infrastructure based on AWS Lambda for uploading images (or any other files) with private storage in an AWS S3 bucket. We will be using terraform scripts that are uploaded and available at my kompotkot/hatchery GitHub repository.
This approach has the following advantages:
lambda is called on request and therefore allows to save on server maintenance costs if this functionality is not key for your application
lambda functions have an isolated runtime environment, which is ideal for processing uploaded files. Should malicious code be uploaded, the attacker will not be able to leave the sandbox, and the sandbox session will be forcibly terminated after some time
storing files in an S3 bucket is very cheap

No matter if you are a DevOps/SysOps engineer, developer, or just a Linux enthusiast, you will most likely have to use SQL at some point in your career.
The guide is suitable for anyone working as a developer, system administrator, or a DevOps engineer and wants to learn the basics of SQL.
Before we dive deep into SQL, let&#x27;s quickly define what a database is.
The definition of databases from Wikipedia is:
A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.
In other words, a database is a collection of data stored and structured in different database tables.
You&#x27;ve most likely worked with spreadsheet systems like Excel or Google Sheets. At the very basic, database tables are quite similar to spreadsheets.

The simpliest way to use it is 
| rex regex
With this command, you will search for an element in the whole log.
If you want to search in a specific field, add field&#x3D; and the name of your field.
| rex field&#x3D; regex
example
| rex field&#x3D;uri *regex*

About how to write the regex, you have to follow the next pattern
[Regex about the text before the desired value][Regex about the desired value][Regex about the text after the desired value]
The first and the last part are really look like a classic regex.
(?\w+)
Wrote like this, you will declare the field where you want insert your new data and you have the regex corresponding to your value.
Also you can retrieve multiple datas from a single rex command.
Retrieve a username
| rex &quot;user\s(?\w+)\s&quot;

Retrieve the email sender and the destination of a mail
| rex field&#x3D;_raw &quot;From: .*)&gt; To: .*)&gt;&quot;

                    <span>Jaeger is a popular open-source tool used for distributed tracing in a microservice architecture. In a microservice architecture, a user request or transaction can travel across hundreds of services before serving what a user wants. Distributed tracing helps to track the performance of a transaction across multiple services.
Jaeger is a fantastic open-source tool for distributed tracing. But for effective resolution of production issues, engineering teams need both metrics and traces. SigNoz, a full-stack open-source tool, provides a unified UI for both metrics and traces.

Before we deep dive into how Jaeger accomplishes distributed tracing for microservices-based architecture, let&#x27;s take a short detour to understand distributed tracing.

                    <span>There is a huge need for engineers in the SRE and DevOps spectrum right now. Anywhere you look, whether it&#x27;s LinkedIn, Indeed, or another job site, you&#x27;ll see thousands of job postings. The interesting thing is there are now other titles popping up, including:
Platform engineer
Reliability engineer
Performance engineer
When you look at these job postings, including the job postings for DevOps engineer or Site Reliability Engineer, you&#x27;ll notice something; they all sort of look the same.
Why?
Simply put, because the industry doesn&#x27;t truly know where to place these engineers due to the fact that they have to know a little bit of everything
So what are they? Developers? Architects? Infrastructure engineers? The answer is yes.

                    <span>Dubai To find out more about accessibility features and ebook readers with a disability, BookNet Canada surveyed adult readers who bought and read ebooks. 17% of ebook readers said they &quot;had been medically diagnosed with a vision impairment or print disability.&quot; 
Approximately half of all digital readers use accessibility features of some kind. Many readers commented that reading ebooks hurt their eyes and to compensate they would adjust the screen resolution or lighting, increase the font size, or change the background colour. 
Some stats from that survey:
45% adjust font size or spacing, 42% use the night display, and 48% read on the vertical screen.
Almost a quarter (26%) adjust the colour for the text or background, 25% magnify the screen, and 13% use a screen reader.
When asked how readers look for information within a book while reading, 67% use the table of contents, 45% use search, 43% use the index, and 38% use their own bookmarks.
How can I make my accessible ebook discoverable?
Library staff need to know if your books have enhanced accessibility; retailers should display this information (and should be able to display it in advance of receiving the EPUB file); and readers and consumers should know if accessibility features are disabled as well as what is built in.
While you can supply metadata directly with the EPUB file, and it can carry information about accessibility, it&#x27;s no help for anyone deciding if this ISBN represents a product that&#x27;s usable for their needs. So, where do you go to provide accessibility metadata?</span>

                    <span>What Is OpenGL?


OpenGL is a Graphics rendering API which is operating system independent, window system independent and has high-quality color images composed of geometric and image primitives. OpenGL APIs can use following - 
GL


OpenGL API implementation (http://www.opengl.org)
GLU


OpenGL Utility
Glut


GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) ‚Äì Glut is portable windowing API and it is not officially part of OpenGL.
OpenGL Utility Toolkit (http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/)
FLTK


FlashLight ToolKit (http://www.fltk.org/)
GLEW
Now lets see how to install OpenGL in Ubuntu.
Now because GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) depends upon OpenGL and a number of other related libraries, if we install GLUT then OpenGL will be automatically be installed.
First update the repository using the given command
$ sudo apt-get update

Run the following command to install OpenGL.
$ sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev

Now to test if OpenGL libraries are working fine on our Linux machine, we will create a C++ program and test it.
So create a following C++ Program.
#include 

void displayMe(void)
{
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
    glBegin(GL_POLYGON);
        glVertex3f(0.5, 0.0, 0.5);
        glVertex3f(0.5, 0.0, 0.0);
        glVertex3f(0.0, 0.5, 0.0);
        glVertex3f(0.0, 0.0, 0.5);
    glEnd();
    glFlush();
}

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    glutInit(&amp;argc, argv);
    glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_SINGLE);
    glutInitWindowSize(400, 300);
    glutInitWindowPosition(100, 100);
    glutCreateWindow(&quot;Hello world!&quot;);
    glutDisplayFunc(displayMe);
    glutMainLoop();
    return 0;
}

Now give the command below to compile your code.
$ g++ main.cpp -o firstOpenGlApp -lglut -lGLU -lGL

Now run your OpenGl program with following command
$ ./firstOpenGlApp

You will see something like this on your screen if everythings went well.</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve asked in various places including Stackoverflow and at work this question but not getting anything back: how to get a list of all project deployments regardless of retention period (specifically using Octopus Deploy REST API)?
What I&#x27;m currently getting: a list of all project deployments as per retention period set.
I believe (might be wrong) it&#x27;s retention period is set per environment as, for example, for project X I&#x27;m getting 2 Live deployments back and in the same project all (by default) of Branch Tests.
I&#x27;m wanting to get a list of all project deployments but, to me at least, seems odd I can&#x27;t get just a list regardless of retention period.
This gets me a list of all deployments but still only get 2 for Live for instance.
HTTP GET: https:///api/deployments
Does anyone have idea how to get around this? Or have I missed something? There is documentation online in general but not enough tbh and not this specific.</span>

                    <span>Hello Reader üëã
To update an object inside a nested array in MongoDB you can use this approach, Its well tested and working.
Update nested array objects. See below picture for a better Idea what we are going to do. We will update the object which is nested by 3 levels of array.
{
 discussionList[
  discussionList [
   {
     object-value-to-be-updated.
   }
  ]
 ]
} 


public courseCategoryPostCommentReplyUpdate(operation: CommentReplyUpdateMutation): Promise {
    return this.courseCategoryPostCommentsModel.updateOne(
      {
        &quot;postId&quot; : operation.postId,
        &#x27;discussionList&#x27;: {
          &#x27;$elemMatch&#x27;: {
            &#x27;_id&#x27;: operation.commentId,
            &quot;discussionList._id&quot;: operation.replyId
          }
        }
      },
      {
        $set: {
          &quot;discussionList.$[outer].discussionList.$[inner].payload&quot;: operation.payload,
          &quot;discussionList.$[outer].discussionList.$[inner].isUpdated&quot;: true,
          &quot;discussionList.$[outer].discussionList.$[inner].commentUpdateTime&quot;: new Date()
        }
      },
      {
        arrayFilters: [
          { &quot;outer._id&quot;: operation.commentId},
          {&quot;inner._id&quot;: operation.replyId}

      ]
      }
    );
  }

FootNotes - this code is to update the reply of a comment.
That&#x27;s how you can perform operations on an object in nested array in mongoDB document. You can also update/delete the objects which are having the more level of nesting by just modifying the query.
Please let me know if the code needs an explanation. Thanks üôÇ</span>

This is fine for private code but it&#x27;s likely to make people who use Node a bit uncomfortable.  Node is nice a stable, it&#x27;s well known, it doesn&#x27;t rock the boat.  When developing new libraries I figured it might be an interesting idea to make them compatible so when the time comes I don&#x27;t have to re-implement them to change runtimes.  Sadly this turns out to be harder than expected.  The problem isn&#x27;t too unlike sharing code between node and the browser.  Node made many early decisions pre-standardization that have rendered important parts of it incompatible.  We don&#x27;t have east access to fetch for example, we have much more low level http.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re using react router in your App, then you probably wanted to protect some routes from specific users, or to Redirect some users to their own page or component.
In this blog we&#x27;ll see How to handle that with some simple checks

So at the beginning this is how our App looks like

At this point every user can access those two components (Admin, Home)
But that&#x27;s not what i want, I want just the admin to have access to the &quot;/admin&quot; route.
And those who don&#x27;t have access to that route, I need to redirect them to the Home Page (&quot;/&quot; route)
So the 1st Step is to create the ProtectedRoute Component.
You can create it in the same file, but for a cleaner code we&#x27;ll create it on a new file
protectedRoute.js.





  
  
  2- Paste this code in that file



So basically we check if there is a token stored in our LocalStorage or not.
If The check is Truthy then he Have access to that route.

You need to change that check to suit your case.
Don&#x27;t forget to export your Component.

Import The ProtectedRoute Component from where you created it

I spent the last three months reading the Agile Application Security book, book, which helped to learn more about how to:
Add security practices to each stage of the existing SDLC.
Integrate security with planning, requirements, design, and at the code level.
Implement regulatory compliance in an agile or DevOps environment.
Build an effective security program through a culture of empathy, openness, transparency, and collaboration.
The software development area is changing every day, and it keeps accelerating. Therefore, The security pioneers should also change the way how to operate.
Integrating security in each stage of your existing development lifecycle requires a good plan and a well-documented study on your current environment setup.

In this TryHackMe room you will be tasked with cracking the password to a binary by bypassing the authentication sequence. There are multiple ways to solve this CTF, but I will go over a few of the ways I solved it.
Practice your skills in reversing and get the flag bypassing the login.
To start things off, I pull the strings to find what catches my eye, scrolling through the strings I find THM{ %d%d }. After doing countless CTFs I already know that flags are typically formatted this way (e.g flag{}, THM{}, htb{}), %d is a string format that takes an argument and prints it as an integer we will see that later on in Ghidra. You can read more about %d here.

Facebook and Google login is widely used as an authentication module in our modern web application. There are API keys assigned to every application created using these platforms.
In this tutorial, we will authenticate users using Facebook, and Google authentication. We will manage and secure our API secrets with Doppler.
Doppler has significantly changed and increased the productivity of our applications since its release. No need to subject our secrets to vulnerabilities by storing them in a .env file located in our project directory. Over time, I have had to make the mistake of hosting my applications alongside my .env  on Github. But thanks to Doppler, all that is a thing of the past. 
To manage your secrets using Doppler, you need to create a Doppler account. To get started,‚Ä¶</span>

I made a case for cutting down the number of options a piece of code can have so our tool chain including your IDE of choice can help you serving with just the right thing you need at the right moment, or help you &quot;remember&quot; every place a given object was used without having to guess it by use a &quot;Find in all files&quot; type dialog.
However toxic flexibility can sprout up in TypeScript as well.

Setting up a Typescript React Native Project with Redux can be tricky for beginners, in this article, I will teach you how you can easily get started.
I am assuming, you have a React Native Typescript Project setup, if you don&#x27;t, you can run this command:
npx react-native init ProjectName --template react-native-template-typescript
Your project will automatically be bootstrapped with typescript template.
I like using yarn, but you can also use npm
yarn add redux react-redux redux-thunk
Afterwards, let&#x27;s install redux type definitions 
yarn add @types/react-redux -D

Indeed, you&#x27;re requested to write high-quality code and at the same time writing code without any bugs. For all my projects, I always install these NPM packages to make my React code better.
I&#x27;ve started programming with PHP, a very permissive programming language like JavaScript. It was an easy language to start with but a nightmare to maintain or program when your applications start growing.
I discover a new world with strongly typed languages like C/C++ or Java. One major advantage of strongly typed language is to catch errors earlier in the development process. In the end, you write better code with fewer bugs in your application.

                    <span>Have you ever wanted to use React components in an Angular application ? Or to start migrating an Angular app to React component-by-component ? Or simply use both at the same time ?
I developped ngx-react which allows you to do just that with ease.
It enables you to use your Angular components in React, and vice versa, quite transparently, and without boilerplate.
Just declare a bridge, somewhere in your application:
import { NgxReactBridge } from &#x27;ngx-react&#x27;;

export const bridge &#x3D; new NgxReactBridge()
    // bridge options:
    .addProvider(/** Add a global react provider here */);

Then, to use an Angular component in React, just import it like that:
const AsReact &#x3D; bridge.toReact(MyAngularCommonent);

// use it üëâ  

The generated ‚öõÔ∏è component will take as props all the @Input()s of your üÖ∞Ô∏è component, and all the @Output()s, mapped to functions. (i.e. @Output() onThing: EventEmitter will be mapped to prop onThing: (event: string) &#x3D;&gt; void.
To use a React component in Angular, you&#x27;ll have to do a tiny bit more work... for instance if you have a React component:
function MyReactComponent(props: {
  data: string;
  dataChange: (evt: string) &#x3D;&gt; void;
}) {
    // [...]
}


Then magically convert it to its Angular counterpart like that:
@Directive({ selector: &quot;my-react-component&quot; })
export class MyReactComponent_Angular extends reactBridge.toAngular(
  MyReactComponent
) {

  // a bit of extra work: You will have to map the properties yourself 
  @Input()
  data!: string;
  @Output()
  dataChange &#x3D; new EventEmitter();
}

(the Angular compiler doesnt allow to build dynamic components... so we have to declare them statically)
Just inject Angular services in React like that:
const service &#x3D; useService(MyAngularService);

I&#x27;ll write more about this when I have more time üëâ But please share your thought if you have some :)

                    <span>Hi, everyone. I&#x27;m sure you know, route management in an enterprise project is a tricky task. Enum (typescript data structure) is often used to keep them persistent. But enum itself doesn&#x27;t solve all problems while we handle the route concatenation. Let&#x27;s take a look at an example.
Suppose we have three levels of nesting routes:
enum ROOT_ROUTES {
  CATALOG &#x3D; &#x27;catalog&#x27;,
  ABOUT &#x3D; &#x27;about&#x27;,
  SUPPORT &#x3D; &#x27;support&#x27;,
}

enum CATALOG_ROUTES {
  CATEGORY &#x3D; &#x27;category&#x27;,
  ITEM &#x3D; &#x27;item&#x27;,
  CART &#x3D; &#x27;cart&#x27;
}

enum CATEGORY_ROUTES {
  TOP &#x3D; &#x27;top&#x27;,
  SALES &#x3D; &#x27;sales&#x27;,
  ALL &#x3D; &#x27;all&#x27;
}

Then, in order to assemble the full route, we have to correctly concatenate all the intermediate values:
const topCategoryRoute &#x3D; &#x60;/${ROOT_ROUTES.CATALOG}/${CATALOG_ROUTES.CATEGORY}/${CATEGORY_ROUTES.TOP}&#x60;;

This article explains how to manage subscriptions in Angular components without repeating the same teardown logic in each component.
There are two common ways to manage RxJS subscriptions in Angular components to prevent memory leaks:
@Component({
  selector: &#x27;interval&#x27;,
  templateUrl: &#x27;./interval.component.html&#x27;,
})
export class IntervalComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  // initialize &#x60;Subscription&#x60; object

    );

                    <span>While we wait for a regex type in TypeScript, starting on TypeScript 4.1 we can make use of a very neat trick to create string patterns validations which can come in handy for some simple use cases.
I&#x27;m using Leonardo Victor&#x27;s approach to query endpoints in multiple APIs using the Angular HttpClient.
By making use of string patterns I&#x27;m able to validate the urls to some extent.
type ApiAlias &#x3D; &#x27;my-api&#x27; | &#x27;third-party-api&#x27; | &#x27;another-api&#x27;;

type ApiUrl &#x3D; &#x60;@${ApiAlias}/${string}&#x60;;

const MY_ENDPOINT: ApiUrl &#x3D; &#x27;@my-api/myendpoint&#x27;;

const ANOTHER_ENDPOINT: ApiUrl &#x3D; &#x27;@thirdparty-api/anotherendpoint&#x27;;

TypeScript Playground
ANOTHER_ENDPOINT will throw an error because thirdparty-api has a typo. It&#x27;s missing a hyphen, and should be third-party-api.

                    <span>Last week, I was having a problem in my current job, that basically we were refactoring stuffs in our code, and one of them was the Status Screen.
How to have a global Status for our API responses, without to have it as a Screen?
The response takes a bit to come for me, but, at evening the light came, why not use a High Order Component to get around this problem?!
So, let&#x27;s start doing it, first and formals, we are going to use React Native (Expo Bare-Workflow), to be able to get our results more quickly, but the same can be achieved using React Native CLI.
First, we&#x27;re going to init our project, as I&#x27;m using Expo, I&#x27;ll do:
expo init

After that, I&#x27;m going to select my workflow, based on expo. So I&#x27;ll select:

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently noticed an alarming trend. There is a high churn of frontend developers due to the burnout. It&#x27;s a shame, but it totally makes sense if you take a deeper look at the problem. It&#x27;s not something you normally notice. All burnouts are sneaky, but this one is special. It comes creeping very slowly and before you notice it&#x27;s too late. This article is a personal reflection from the interviews conducted with people who decided to leave the frontend field due to the burnout.

Things were simpler back in the days. jQuery was king and we relied on it to get things done. And we did get things done too. Browser wars made the frontend world accelerate at incredible speed. There were many new cool APIs we could use, but they were often browser specific. ‚Ä¶</span>

Angular uses reactive methods to process and manage form. It is easy to use reactive forms to capture user inputs events, validate the inputs and create form models in large angular applications. This enables the tracking of data and changes in the form model in all parts of the application.
Reactive forms provide a model-driven approach to handling form inputs whose values change over time. It uses an explicit and immutable approach to manage the form at a given point in time and it is built around observable streams.
Register the reactive form module in the app module declaration of an angular app. This module declares a reactive form directives needed to use the reactive form

BigInt lets you represent numbers bigger than 253. This is useful when you need to perform mathematical operations on very large integers. And you can work directly with large integer IDs and high resolution timestamps.
You can create a bigint primitive in two ways:
const n0 &#x3D; 1n;
const n1 &#x3D; new BigInt(1);

There is no interoperability between bigint and number primitives, but they can be compared.
NOTE: BigInt support is only available for the esnext target.

First, in the tsconfig.json file at the root of the project, I clean up the imports and allow JSON files to be resolved on import, as shown ...
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    ...
    &quot;allowSyntheticDefaultImports&quot;: true,
    &quot;resolveJsonModule&quot;: true
   ...
  }
} 

In the assets folder, I define the mock-data in the following path ...
assets/mock-data/api/

For this article, assume there is a users.json file in the api folder.
Within the project, I create a config.json file that can be imported.
{

}

                    <span>What is CI/CD?



CI stands for Continous Integration
CD stands for Continous Delivery or Continous Deployment
Let me explain through a example: 
When you make a commit and push sources to Git SCM(Source Code Management like Github, GitLab etc), then automatic builds and tests are run with the latest changes, this is knows as Continous Integration
With Continous Delivery, code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. Continuous delivery expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and put on a manual approval for adding them in production envirment.
Continous Deployment expands upon continuous delivery and pushed to production environment automatically without any approval.

                    <span>What is Docker? - &quot;build once and run anywhere.&quot;


Docker is a software development tool and a virtualisation technology that makes it easy to develop, deploy, and manage applications by using containers. Container refers to a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that contains all the libraries, configuration files, dependencies, and other necessary parts to operate the application.
In other words, applications run in the same way, irrespective of where they are and what machine they are running on because the container provides the environment throughout the software development lifecycle of the application. Since containers are isolated, they provide security, thus allowing multiple containers to run simultaneously on the given host. Also, containers are li‚Ä¶</span>

Recently I changed my workstation, I used to code on a Macbook Air before, but now I moved to a desktop, and because of it, I needed to configure my VPN all again, no big deal.
I&#x27;m currently using Deepin as my distro, and I did not have much problems until today.
If you have skipped the last part, just to let you know, I need to configure a VPN.
&quot;Ok, but what does this have with docker?&quot; - you may ask.
Well, the VPN setup came up alright, I use OpenVPN and it works just fine.
But the problem came when I tried to access a private address, visible only to the ones with VPN access, and I could not, even though I was connected, but why?

                    <span>Steps to reduce EC2 development instances cost using scheduled scaling.
We are all aware that Amazon Web Services is one of the most popular and used Cloud platforms. Most of us use AWS for hosting. When building apps, we might have different environments for development, staging, UAT, and production.
So if our app uses a web machine and a worker, then we have these same machines in all environments. For example, if we use a development and production environment, we will have 4 instances. But when compared to production instances, Our development environment will have low-end instances. But the low-end instance also adds cost to our billing.
We can reduce the development instance cost up to 60%. We can save this cost and use it in any other way. We will see how to cut down the cost.

                    <span>The OpenSSH 8.8 is now in the stable channel of Arch Linux and could reach other distributions any time soon.
In the release 8.7, the OpenSSH team announced that the ssh-rsa signature scheme will be disabled by default in the next version: 8.8.
The ssh-rsa signature scheme uses SHA-1 and it&#x27;s sensible to chosen-prefix attacks.
This should not be a problem unless you are connecting to a server using the weak ssh-rsa public key algorithm for host authentication.
üí° If you&#x27;re using the version 8.7 or a previous one, you can test your remote hosts like a GitLab or a cloud server using:
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms&#x3D;-ssh-rsa user@host

If the connection fails, that means that the signature algorithm is not compatible with the default configuration of OpenSSH 8.8.
If you can&#x27;t upgrade the signature algorithm on your remote servers but you still need to use them, you can use the following command:
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms&#x3D;+ssh-rsa user@host

Right now, Bitbucket uses this weak signature algorithm, I guess you need to use your Git repositories hosted there. ü•∫ You can check your connection with the following command:
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms&#x3D;+ssh-rsa git@bitbucket.org

How can we enable this flag for all the Git commands? An easy solution is coming... You can create an SSH configuration file with the following content:
Host bitbucket.org
     HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
     IdentitiesOnly yes

The default location of this file is under ~/.ssh/config, maybe you already have one. Once you add this configuration value you can use any git command without restrictions.
I hope this will help you to still SSHing the world üó∫Ô∏è</span>

You&#x27;ve probably used grep before. ripgrep is like grep, just better. Faster, with nicer defaults, and more powerful! https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep

I probably use fzf more than any other tool in this list. If you have a hard time remembering where you put this very important module in your codebase, just type fzf and it&#x27;ll bring up a list of files that you can easily sift through https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
jq


If you&#x27;re working with JSON, you need to try jq. It allows you to parse, filter and transform any JSON file with an a simple query language. https://github.com/stedolan/jq

You might have used less before. But did you know you could use it like tail --follow? less +F logfile will stream any new lines added to your log file! You can also filter the stream with &amp; or pause it with Ctrl+C
entr


If you&#x27;re tired of having to run your test suite manually any time you update a file, try this: git ls-files | entr -c . It will run your command every time you update a file in your project.

                    <span>When building a modern JavaScript app, you will likely rely on many other packages and third-party dependencies. For example, you might use react and react-dom for your UI, lodash for utility helper methods, webpack or rollup as your bundler, and jest with @testing-library/react for unit tests.
All of these packages are stored as dependencies in your package.json file. Understanding whether to include them as dependencies, devDependencies, or peerDependencies can sometimes be a struggle for newer developers.
In this article we&#x27;ll look at the three types of dependencies found in the package.json file and what each does.
dependencies are packages used in your app&#x27;s production bundle. If you&#x27;re building a React app, then react and react-dom would be dependencies. If you&#x27;re using react-router ‚Ä¶</span>

Nodejs is now one of the most popular tool for backend purpose. This is so especially because of how easy it is to understand the language. It is built on JavaScript.
However, it doesn&#x27;t have so much frameworks out there that gives you all the basics (boring) stuff off the box. Basics includes things like setting up server, folder structure, authentication, mailers and so on.
Just incase you are new to Nodejs, I have a few courses you might want to checkout:
Setting Up a Simple, Secure and Robust Node JS Server
CRUD APP with Nodejs, Cloudinary, PostgreSQL and Heroku

                    <span>How we define our types in Typescript impacts how effective typescript is at warning us when we make mistakes. If we take a broad approach i.e. to cover many types in a single type, we end up handicapping typescript and it becomes less effective. 
The more specific we are, the more effective typescript can be at catching possible errors. In this article, we are going to look at how we can use discriminative unions to write better and more specific types and help typescript to be more helpful to us.
Let&#x27;s take the simplest example I can think of - Shapes. In shapes, we can have Circles, Rectangles, Squares, etc; you get the idea. There is no way you can have a single type alias that can cover all shapes without compromising on something.

                    <span>Large companies have security teams that scrutinize every partner and vendor they use. They put the vendor through the wringer with security reviews that usually involve long and tedious spreadsheets. 
The result of those painful security reviews is generally an analysis on the relative level of risk that comes with the solution. Then the business stakeholder can choose to take the advice of security or overrule it (spending political capital in the process) to say that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The review process is painful for everyone and, frankly, despite the intentions of various startups and others, it seems to be getting worse, not better.
And we have another problem: only the biggest companies even get to evaluate the security of their vendors. The rest of us aren&#x27;t privvy t‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Let&#x27;s Not Overcomplicate It


Definition: Application-layer Encryption (ALE) is when you encrypt data before sending it to a data store. There are many variations, but at its core, that&#x27;s it.
There are three main ways in which implementations may differ:
Code vs. Service: In some implementations, the encryption/decryption truly happens inside the application, which calls encrypt() or decrypt() routines. In others, an intermediate service or proxy essentially does that for you.
Client vs. Server: Some systems are strict about only encrypting and decrypting data in the client, which brings zero-trust data systems using end-to-end encryption (E2EE). E2EE is a subset of application-layer encryption. But encryption/decryption may alternately happen on the server. For server-side application-lay‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>When starting in the world of cybersecurity/hacking, we always want to run and hack anything but it&#x27;s important to know the basics. 
The reason why you lock your house when you go out so no bad guy comes inside and steal your belongings is similar to why companies are so serious about information security, Spoiler alert: no one wants their personal belongings get stolen.
Information security means securing or protecting sensitive and important information as well as the systems that store this information from any unauthorized handling.
Information security consists of various important elements, we will first start with the CIA triad and later with the rest of elements. 
The CIA triad consists of three important elements:



1. Confidentiality(C)
2. Integrity(I)
3. Availability(A)


Now, what do they mean?
Confidentiality: Only those with authorized access will be able to access the information. Example: Encryption

Integrity: The assurance that the information/data haven&#x27;t suffered any unauthorized modification. Example: Hashing

Availability: Data always been accessible for authorized users when required. Example: Backups, clustered machines

Non-repudiation: Senders of a message can&#x27;t deny having sent a message and the receivers can&#x27;t deny having received it. Example: Digital Signatures

Authenticity: Guarantee of something being genuine. Example: Digital certificates,bio-metrics



  
  
  Why Information Security attacks happen?



Attacks occur for a variety of reasons like attackers wanting to steal sensitive information, data disclosure, ransomware and many others. 
It&#x27;s important to understand the threats that a system may face to implement required preventive measures. 
You can start learning and understanding the different hacking phases:
1. Reconnaissance(Footprinting)
2. Scanning
3. Gaining access
4. Maintaining access
5. Clearing logs

The end of this tutorial you will have the following result.

Have Node.js installed.
Have a code editor installed (in my case VSCode)
Create a project on my desktop with the name we want to assign it.
mkdir todo-realtime

Favicon is small icon that is usually shown in browser tab text to title of the site. Some Operating System display it differently, like Android or MacOS.
The best way to get favicon that will work on every device is to use generator that will do that for you.
I personally use Real Favicon Generator I trust that It create favicon for every possible use case.
To generate favicon you just upload an image. If you want best possible favicon you can generate one for MacOS and Windows that often need different background (those are

                    <span>basic syntax for cron


a typical cron job looks like this
# m h  dom mon dow   command
  * *   *   *   *   /usr/bin/sh ls

stand for wildcard
this is not a cron tutorial this is just how i use it. 
the bash script looks like
#!/bin/sh
export DISPLAY&#x3D;:0
notify-send &quot;EYES CHECK&quot; &quot;Look away for 15 seconds&quot;

without line no 2 it wont work as it sets the display for notify-send. I am using notify-send as my notification daemon. 
make sure that your display is :0 
echo $DISPLAY

first you will need to make sure cron is running you can do this  by:
systemctl status cronie

p.s. this is specific to arch based system.
once cron is running you can create/edit cron job with crontab -e
then paste the code present below into the window.
*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/sh  /home/elnovo/.noti/eyes.sh

it runs every 15 min and eyes.sh is the bash script we discussed above. save it. 
crontab -l
notify-send doesn&#x27;t work from crontab</span>

                    <span>Some context:


I&#x27;m just a student and I have been using windows from my childhood, but I switched  to linux about a month ago. I install ubuntu on my main PC as windows was lagging a lot. My PC is a very low end PC so I taught to give linux a try. I then installed kde plasma environment on my ubuntu. And I am so happy with it that I would never switch to windows again.
Linux has a lot of awesome features. Lemme list few of the notable ones. 
Completely Free :


Customisation :


Flexibility :


Runs better on low end hardware :



and many other features...
If you are a developer, there is a high chance you are already using linux, but if you are not, then you can give it a try. 
I haven&#x27;t tried many distros but according to me , you can try Ubuntu for basic users. Or you can try Kubuntu, it has KDE environment &amp; has a lot of customisation features while is still very user friendly. 
After all linux is used everywhere from the high end servers to your android smartphones, so why not give it a try on your desktop computer as well. 
TL;DR - Give Linux a try, especially KDE plasma environment (Kubuntu)</span>

                    <span>I finally set up my DSLR camera as a webcam, and it‚Äôs pretty cool. I wanted to share this post because I couldn‚Äôt find good, complete resources about it and I thought it might be useful for folks out there (and because future me will probably want it). Here‚Äôs everything I learned.
Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm working with. Your setup may be different:
Camera: Canon EOS 60D
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.10
Before we get started, this may be a non-issue for a lot of folks as it‚Äôs common for camera manufacturers to create software for this. Canon, for example, make their EOS Webcam Utility that makes it easy for Windows or OSX users. But I use Linux (cue sad trombone).
If you‚Äôre like me and a handy webcam utility is not an option, let‚Äôs continue.
Firstly, make sure your camera is supported by checking this ‚Ä¶</span>

The software development process has changed a lot in last few years. Many of the modern tools &amp; frameworks has built-in support to ensure that the code is clean, maintainable and readable. But any developer can make mistakes while coding a feature on mind and that&#x27;s totally fine. We all have gone through that stage &amp; we learnt through making mistakes.
In this article I am going to share some of the basic to advanced levels of checks which I learnt through working on Enterprise software applications. These are some of the best practices that you can follow or explore.

                    <span>The loopback interface is a virtual interface on Linux, which allows us to connect to the GNS3 network simulator.
In the following I will explain how to install and configure the TAP Interface on the Linux operating system.
First you should install uml-utilities by typing the command sudo apt install uml-utilities.
Next step create a virtual interface by typing the command sudo tunctl -t tap10, then assign an IP Address to the interface by typing the command sudo ifconfig tap10 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up.
The last check whether the IP address has been successfully added using the ifconfig tap10 command.</span>

                    <span>I recently switched to pipewire on my Opensuse build and I&#x27;m loving it so far. I switched over to pipewire because it fixes a lot of pulseaudio issues which I&#x27;ve faced in the past. Pipewire is really new and still in the works and its more upto date for recent hardwares and bluetooth peripherals.
I&#x27;ve made a script which has does other stuff but has an option for switching to pipewire without much hassle. Clone it and run it and enter the correct option.
git clone https://github.com/drunckj/Asus-ESS
cd Asus-ESS/
./setupscript.sh

First we need to install all the necessary files
sudo zypper install pipewire pipewire-pulseaudio pipewire-alsa

It will show and errors about conflicts you should select option 1 to fix the issue which reads de-installation.
systemctl --user enable --now pipewire.{service,socket}
systemctl --user enable --now pipewire-pulse.{service,socket}

After running the above commands, you should reboot.
pactl info

Look for server name in output. If it shows 
Server Name: PulseAudio (on PipeWire)
Sometimes pipewire doesn&#x27;t generate config files so we have to move them to the right location. This can cause the bluetooth to not work too. Follow the below steps for fixing it.
If your having errors check if the below directory exists
/etc/pipewire
~/.config/pipewire

If they don&#x27;t exist, do the following and reboot and check again by running pactl info again.
sudo cp -r /usr/share/pipewire /etc/

The above command will move the config files to their default locations.</span>

Docker tags convey useful information about a specific image version/variant.
They are aliases to the ID of your image which often look like this: 8f5487c8b942
Assigning tag while building image
docker build -t demo:v1 .


Assigning tag if no tag default
Lets build a image without tag.
docker build .


Now lets assign tag to the existing image without tag.
docker tag adc07a47930e demo:v2


tag for existing tag of the image
This will create another image with the same IMAGE ID.
docker tag demo:v2 demo2:v3


Whenever you make changes inside the container, it can be useful to commit a container‚Äôs file changes or settings into a new image.
By default, the container being committed and its processes will be paused while the image is committed.
