Best Frameworks for Developing Progressive Web Applications
1. AngularJS
It is a framework built in 2010 and largely used for creating dependable and stable PWAs using the ecosystem of JavaScript. The system helps make an amazing PWA through JSON set up so that there is no need to begin from scratch. Angular‚Äôs web app development services are so much easier as it saves the hassle of handling repetitive tasks.
PWAs created using this framework also leverage the distinctive compilation method and ahead-of-time or AOT. It has a large developers community, a huge third-party extensions archive, and modular elements. The security and speed are increased with the amazing concept of the AOT compiler.

If you need a content service with multiple languages, I highly recommend NGX-Translate. This package offers a simple API and Pipe mechanism to re-use pieces of content but also supports multiple languages.

In this tutorial, I will show you how Materialize works by using it to run SQL queries on continuously produced nginx logs. By the end of the tutorial, you will have a better idea of what Materialize is, how it&#x27;s different than other SQL engines, and how to use it.
For the sake of simplicity, I will use a brand new Ubuntu 21.04 server where I will install nginx, Materialize and mzcli, a CLI tool similar to psql used to connect to Materialize and execute SQL on it.
If you want to follow along you could spin up a new Ubuntu 21.04 server on your favorite could provider. 
If you prefer running Materialize on a different operating system, you can follow the steps on how to install Materialize here:

                    <span>By default when you install apache2, and navigate to /var/www directory you won&#x27;t find the cgi-bin folder. To enable CGI in apache2 follow this steps -
$ sudo apt install apache2 -y

We can find the available modules in /etc/apache2/mods-available. Here you will see the cgi.load module which you need to load.
Enable by-
$ sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/mods-available/cgi.load

Now as Apache configuration has changed, reload the apache service by -
$ sudo service apache2 reload

Apache2 recognizes cgi-scripts in the directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin, so we need to place the script in this folder.
Lets create a cgi script in python that returns the output of free -m command.
#!/usr/bin/python3

from subprocess import getstatusoutput as gso
import cgi

print(&quot;content-type:text/plain&quot;)
print()

print(gso(&quot;free -m&quot;)[1])

Make this script executable by -
$ sudo chmod +x c.py

Now just curl to get response

                    <span>FreeCodeCamp states that if any component receives new state or new props, it re-renders itself and all its children. This is usually okay. But React provides a lifecycle method you can call when child components receive new state or props, and declare specifically if the components should update or not. The method is shouldComponentUpdate(), and it takes nextProps and nextState as parameters.


You can use shouldComponentUpdate() to prevent this by comparing the props. The method must return a boolean value that tells React whether or not to update the component. 


Code:




class OnlyEvens extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    console.log(&#x27;Should I update?&#x27;);
    // Change code below this line
    return true;
    // Change code above this line
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log(&#x27;Component re-rendered.&#x27;);
  }
  render() {
    return 
{this.props.value}
;
  }
}

class Controller extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state &#x3D; {
      value: 0
    };
    this.addValue &#x3D; this.addValue.bind(this);
  }
  addValue() {
    this.setState(state &#x3D;&gt; ({
      value: state.value + 1
    }));
  }
  render() {
    return (
      
Add
        
      
    );
  }
}

Answer:




class OnlyEvens extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    console.log(&#x27;Should I update?&#x27;);
    // Change code below this line
    if (nextProps.value % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 0) {
      return true
    } else {
      return false;
    }
    // Change code above this line
  }

You click the Add button and watch the order of events in your browser&#x27;s console as the lifecycle hooks are triggered.</span>

This service was satisfying for many users as they have enjoyed applying it effeciently to their projects.

                    <span>FreeCodeCamp says that the componentDidMount() method is also the best place to attach any event listeners you need to add for specific functionality. In which React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event system present in browsers. 
We&#x27;ve already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as onClick(). But, if you want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, you have to do this directly.


Today we have to add an event listener in the componentDidMount() method for keydown events and have these events trigger the callback handleKeyPress(). We can use the document.addEventListener() which takes the vent (in quotes) as the first argument and the callback as the second argument.


After that , in componentWllMount(), remove the same e‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>TL;DR: Open a terminal with admin rights and execute the following command: wsl --install. If you want to choose a distro, continue reading!
Until very recently, you had to go through multiple steps to enable WSL in your system. The worst part was that some of them were in the control panel, others in a terminal, and you also had to use the Microsoft Store to choose the Linux distribution you wanted.
With the recent changes they&#x27;ve made for the release of both Windows 11 and the latest Windows 10 update, installing WSL has become a straightforward task.
You only need to run one command if you&#x27;re happy with using Ubuntu as your Linux distribution:
wsl --install

If you prefer another distribution, with this other command, you can list all the available distros:
wsl --list --online

And then, run the installation command:
wsl --install -d 

That&#x27;s it! You&#x27;ll have to restart your computer, and then it will ask you for a username and password. Once you create your user, the process will be completed.</span>

 What is Ansible? 
Ansible is an open source tool that is most used by a SysAdmin in the process of automating.
 Why you should use Ansible? 
Ansible is a powerful tool that you can use in the process of server management, configuration task, and other tasks. So when you use Ansible, many process such as configuration or deployment an application in server will be simple and quickly.

Avance un poco en la guia The odin Project

Instale linux Ubuntu y configure varias particiones necesarias para el curso mencionado arriba.
Aprend√≠ sobre la diferencia de particiones GPT y MBR asi como que son Bios y UEFI.
Domine la herramienta rufus (algo mas para a√±adir al curriculum).
Avance hasta la secci√≥n de Fundamentos de HTML en The odin Project

Aprend√≠ a agregar una clave ssh a mi cuenta de github.
Realice una instalaci√≥n y configuracion de git en linux.
Cree un proyecto de ejemplo en github y realice cambios.
Aprend√≠ que la mejor forma de hacer una explicaci√≥n de los cambios en una confirmaci√≥n (commit) es escribirlo de forma imperativa.
Volv√≠ a aprender los comandos basicos de linux como pwd, touch, cat, ls, cd entre otros.
Y eso es todo por hoy.
Espero que les vaya super bien y que tengan √©xito con sus proyectos.

NodeJS nacio en el a√±o 2009 bajo del nombre de Nodo por Ryan Dahl, quien para ese a√±o formaba parte de Joyent, la empresa que ser√≠a la propietaria de NodeJS.
A pesar que en sus inicios NodeJS tuvo un desarrollo lento, llego a ser la potente plataforma que es hoy, consagrandose como una de las m√°s amadas de los √∫ltimos a√±os.
Es un entorno de ejecucion de un solo hilo de c√≥digo abierto y multiplataforma, de ah√≠ que tenga tan buena comunidad de soporte, se ejecuta bajo el motor JS V8 usado por Google.
En cuanto al lenguaje implementado, el elegido fue JS, mismo que se uso en Scripts del lado de cliente durante sus primeros a√±os (20 aproximadamente), y solo podia usarse con la implementaci√≥n de  en el que un desarrollador necesitaba trabajar con multiples lenguajes para moverse entre el Backend y Frontend.
NodeJS est√° escrito en los inmortales C y C++, y no dejando por fuera JS.
Aplicaciones de chat en tiempo real.
Aplicaciones web.
Servicios de API Rest.
IoT.
Streaming de datos.
Aplicaciones complejas de una sola P√°gina.
Sobre el futuro de NodeJS es dificil de decirlo a ciencia cierta, dado que es una tecnolog√≠a joven y que continua expandiendose, cuenta con un gran futuro por delante, pero tambien dependera del apoyo que la comunidad siga brindandole.

In this cheatsheet show the pipeline of Middleware -&gt; Guards -&gt; Before Interceptors -&gt; Pipes -&gt; Controllers -&gt; Services -&gt; After Interceptors -&gt; Exception Filters that you would typically use in a NestJS rest application.
It&#x27;s important to note that some of these are just highly focused instances of middleware or interceptors. The middleware is the most generic pipeline context and the others are just NestJS constructs to encourage convention.

                    <span>Next.js is an open-source React-based framework built on top of Node.js that is aimed at developing web apps. It includes handy features such as hybrid static &amp; server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, and route pre-fetching.
In the 2020 State of JavaScript survey, Next.js was the second most used back-end framework (behind Express) but claimed the top spot when it came to satisfaction, with 92% of its users stating they are satisfied with the framework.
In this article, we‚Äôll look at how you can integrate Jscrambler into your Next.js app development workflow. This will enable you to protect your JavaScript source code, through a combination of advanced obfuscation, code locks, anti-tampering, and anti-debugging.

                    <span>I‚Äôm absolutely thrilled about Lacework‚Äôs newest announcement‚Äîwe just acquired Soluble, a startup whose mission is to help security and operations teams leverage IaC to scale cloud operations and security for businesses of all sizes. I‚Äôm especially excited about what Lacework‚Äôs incorporation of the Soluble technology means for devs like yourselves. There are countless benefits, but these are the three that I‚Äôm looking forward to the most.  
IaC is quickly becoming the primary mechanism to manage cloud infrastructure at scale. This shift increases both velocity and risk‚Äîto keep up, security and development teams need to quickly address the resulting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Integrating the Soluble technology into Lacework‚Äôs platform and teaming with Soluble‚Äôs experts prepares us to shift further left into developer workflows. 
Lacework can directly and quickly reach developer audiences. Soluble helps Lacework make security issues easier to solve by correlating cloud misconfigurations to IaC and enabling remediation at the source via pull requests. This expands Lacework‚Äôs platform to the places where developers are writing their code: directly in the UX/CLI/GitHub and GitLab. For developers to integrate with Lacework, they simply need to connect through Git. 
Soluble shares Lacework‚Äôs vision to build a modern, data-driven approach to cloud security. Implementing Soluble‚Äôs capabilities to the Lacework platform helps security and operations teams shift further left and partner with developers so they can manage applications and infrastructure efficiently, securely, and reliably.
I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on this acquisition in the comments belowüëá.</span>

In this article, we‚Äôll learn about how systems communicate seamlessly with each other through a process called serialization and deserialization and how we can apply that in TypeScript. The process is seamless because of how the transferable data is handled.
As a user, when you access any application, you do so to retrieve information. This information is made up of data that must be stored somewhere; this is where serialization comes in.
By the end of this article, you should be able to understand how data transfers from one location to another, what format it transfers in, and the possible options for storing data streams. We‚Äôll also cover technical issues that can arise when working with serialization in TypeScript.

                    <span>Ughh‚Ä¶ why does form code in React always get so messy?
It starts out simple: a  component, a couple input fields, and a submit button. But soon things get a little more complicated.
You think, &quot;hmmm.. I want some more validation for this zip code field&quot;. So you add a custom workaround that validates the data in the input field.
Then, you think &quot;I want to disable the submit button when the form is submitting&quot;. So you create another custom workaround that keeps track of what&#x27;s submitting, and when things are complete, etc.
Then, you think &quot;I want better error handling&quot;. So you add yet another workaround.
And over time that simple form balloons into a 400-line long super-component with multiple useEffects, useStates, and custom logic to handle all the edge cases.
Sound familiar?

                    <span>For someone who has worked with Typescript for the past 5+ years, I really miss it when it&#x27;s not there. I find adding types to my javascript code a nice comfort. Writing automated tests with Cypress is no exception. With that being said, adding Typescript support to your Cypress applications is easy peasy!
Cypress ships with official type declarations for TypeScript. This allows you to write your tests in TypeScript. The first thing we need to do is install the typescript dependency.
yarn add --dev typescript

Next we need to update our tsconfig.json file with the following configuration:
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    &quot;target&quot;: &quot;es5&quot;,
    &quot;lib&quot;: [&quot;es5&quot;, &quot;dom&quot;],
    &quot;types&quot;: [&quot;cypress&quot;]
  },
  &quot;include&quot;: [&quot;**/*.ts&quot;]
}

Finally we need to rename all of our .spec.js integration files to .spec.ts. 
If you are like me you&#x27;ve found the path to this point super simple! However, if your application is using Cypress&#x27;s Custom Commands API your Cypress application is now angry.

Don&#x27;t worry this is easy to fix! Let&#x27;s open the file that contains our custom commands (usually support/commands.ts). This file should contain all of your commands as well as a Cypress namespace with a Chainable Interface. It is in this Interface we will add a reference to our custom command(s).
declare namespace Cypress {
  interface Chainable {
    getBySel(selector: string): Chainable
  }
}

Cypress.Commands.add(&#x27;getBySel&#x27;, (selector: string, ...args: any[]): Cypress.CanReturnChainable &#x3D;&gt; {
  return cy.get(&#x60;[data-test&#x3D;${selector}]&#x60;, ...args)
})

And voil√† our Cypress application is happy and now has full support for Typescript!

At first create a folder on Desktop.Command going to be like that..
$ cd Desktop
$ mkdir formik-login

and then get into that directory
$ cd formik-login

and create a react project like that
$ npx create-react-app ./ --template redux-typescript

And open the directory in your favourite text editor.In my case it is vs-code.So run the command
$ code .

Make sure you are in the project directory
Now install formik command is
$ yarn add formik

Now we are ready for your client side login form validation project.You can create different component but i am going to use App.tsx only.
Now at the top import 4 components from formik.

From a developer perspective, the Search API unifies communication between Medusa and search engines thereby allowing you to switch between different engines in seconds with only a couple of lines of code. So far, Medusa has only supported product search using MeiliSearch, but we can now proudly present a plugin for Algolia - one of the giants.
The purpose of this article is to show you how to install and configure Algolia for your Medusa store. Additionally, we&#x27;ll showcase the powerful Search API by guiding you through changing from one search engine to another.

Some applications need multiple languages, but others need one language but have loads of content to re-use. In this article, I want to show you the fastest way to create a content (some call it a dictionary) Service for your Angular application.
If you need a content service with multiple languages, I highly recommend NGX-Translate. This package offers a simple API and Pipe mechanism to re-use pieces of content but also supports multiple languages.

                    <span>Why Python packaging can be hard


There may be a time in your development career where you need to author a package that extends Python w/ C or C++. In such a case your Python package needs to go through a compilation process, which converts C or C++ to binaries that work for a specific target system. This becomes really tedious when you think about how many flavors and versions of Linux there are.  Building a separate binary for Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, etc... Ugh so tiring.
Why Python packaging can be easy w/ manylinux


Fortunately, there is a solution. manylinux was birthed to make it easy for your Python packages to be compatible with most Linux variants. manylinux takes advantage of the fact that most distributions are mindful of backwards compatibility, and intentionally builds bdist wheels on an old version of a distribution. The idea is that if we build on an old supported version, the binaries produced are compatible with current versions.
So what is a manylinux really? Is it a ham sandwich?


No. Even better. It&#x27;s a Docker image. manylinux is a Docker image built off a certain old versions of the CentOS operating system that comes bundled with libraries that are assumed to be present by default on almost all Linux systems.
You can find an example of manylinux distributions within the pandas project. Here are two (out of many) from the list of available pandas downloads from PyPI:
pandas-1.0.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
pandas-1.0.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_i686.whl

In this case, pandas has built manylinux wheels for CPython 3.7 supporting both x86-64 and i686 architectures. It&#x27;s manylinux so this wheel should be compatible for many linux :)
Happy packaging!</span>

                    <span>Introduction


I watched this video by Linus Tech Tips, and decided to improve on his criticisms to hopefully create a better guide to choosing your Linux gaming distro.
These are some common terms to know: 
DE/Desktop Environment: This is the GUI interface to your OS.
Terminal/TTY/Command Line: This is the text based interface to your OS.
As Linux is Free and Open Source Software, you can customize anything and everything you want on any distro. However, as this is a beginner focused guide, it mostly focuses on what is built in to a distro, not what is possible with a distro.

This distribution is simple to use, has a nice DE, and generally doesn&#x27;t get in your way. The breakage caused while installing linux in Linus&#x27; video is something that is trivial to fix. You can expect it to‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>VS Code ü§Ø


VS Code seems to be the 1 size fit all code editor. VS Code offers really seamless integration to develop on a remote connection such as the WSL 2 with the simple installation of an extension.
If you don&#x27;t have it already, install VS Code from the official site. 

(You can also download the insiders build if you like living on the bleeding edge)
While installing VS Code, make sure to check the Add to Path option.

All you need to do is install the Remote - WSL Extension

Start a WSL 2 remote session
Ctrl + Shift + P and type in new wsl window to open up a new WSL 2 window and select the option

A new WSL 2 window should open up from the directory you were using.

It is advised to use VS Code from the Linux file system instead of the windows&#x27;. To do this just use the Open Folder option from the File menu.
Just traverse to ~ or $HOME directory and then add the projects to the Linux file system and use them from there.

Upon opening any projects in WSL window, you will see the WSL 2.0  connection on the bottom-left as well as the title bar.

Quiero comenzar este post con la leyenda que indica que esto no es una guia si no mas bien una historia y suena muy po√©tico decirlo asi porque al fin y a el cabo es una instalaci√≥n de software.
Pero dejemos de darle tantas vueltas al asunto y vayamos a ello.
Un usuario promedio no se preocupa por lo que pasa detr√°s de un sistema operativo pero nosotros que somos desarrolladores deber√≠amos entender como funcionan el software en conjunto con el hardware ya que es muy importante aunque no siempre se necesita este conocimiento hasta que te pones a la tarea.
Aqu√≠ es donde comienza la premisa ¬øpor donde comienzo? e internet te responde: ¬°descargando el software por supuesto!.

                    <span>In my recent post Some Best Practices On Building An Integration, I espoused the benefits of using API owner supplied tools and libraries, and mentioned areas where a well-built SDK hides complexity from, or otherwise makes things easier for, a developer.
A colleague suggested that it might be useful to present examples of some of these areas to give some pointers for someone who needs to implement that functionality themselves, can&#x27;t make use of an SDK, or simply for someone looking to build their own API client. So, this is part 1 of a deep dive into functionality in FreshBooks&#x27; (and some other API owner&#x27;s) SDKs.
This first post won&#x27;t go too much into functionality as I think it&#x27;s best to start on structure.

It&#x27;s the ideal solution for businesses looking to invest in a live-time running environment and application that spans platforms.
JavaScript support is one reason why developers are using Node.js for web application development It comes with a myriad of amazing features, including permitting developers to add web servers and network tools through JavaScript.
In the realm of product development, Node.js could be too complex for the novice, making the user nervous about making a web application that is successful.
However, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s difficult. Given how simple it is to accomplish the task with the help of two-way interaction between client and server is a great‚Ä¶</span>

We have all encountered situations when our lead in an organisation instructs us to get (scrape) information off the internet, especially if we are in a team that does a lot of manual processes to achieve your work. Doing this with a pen and paper can lead to errors and missing out on specific information from the website.
This tutorial will demonstrate how to automate scraping data off of the website and using it for whatever purpose.
You can find the source code of the completed project on CodeSandbox. Fork, tweak the scripts and run the code.

                    <span>Often happens that agility and freedom conflict with security.
Have you ever had developer teams request ownership of a full subscription to be able to freely experiment?
You still want to keep isolation, segregate responsibilities and permissions.
Ability to experiment freely is paramount to innovation, but uncontrolled proliferation of subscriptions can bear a significant management overhead.
Can we have the best of both worlds? The short answer is: yes.
A resource group can be an effective boundary as it allows its contributors to yet create any resource, but also restrict the scope of access within a subscription.
You can also enforce tags and Azure policies to control costs and enforce security.

It is adopted as a common standard for both the front-end and the back-end, and is universally understandable and writable by many people ‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï
In programming, data structures can take many forms, depending on their use; e.g. CSV / XML / YAML / TOML. While there are many examples of these, none are as widespread or as easily understood by everyone as JSON. It is often used for human reading and writing, as well as for client-server interaction.

                    <span>Originally posted here!
To get or access the properties and methods of the main HTML element tag without having errors or red squiggly lines in TypeScript, you have to assert the type for the main HTML element tag using the HTMLElement interface in TypeScript.
The errors or warnings are shown by the TypeScript compiler since the compiler doesn&#x27;t know more information on the main HTML element tag ahead of time. But we know that we are referencing the main HTML tag and thus we can tell the compiler to use the HTMLElement interface which contains the declarations for properties and methods.
// get reference to the first &#x27;main&#x27;
// HTML element tag in the document
// with type assertion using the HTMLElement interface
const mainTag &#x3D; document.querySelector(&quot;main&quot;) as HTMLElement;

// no errors ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Angular v13 has arrived! And with it come a lot of exciting new features and updates. Angular continues to improve runtime performance, decrease compilation time, promote good software development practices, enhance developer experience, and keep up to date with dependencies such as TypeScript and RxJS. Is anyone else excited about RxJS v7?! ü§© Let&#x27;s take a look at a few of the many new exciting features in Angular v13 with some code examples using authentication. 
With v13, View Engine is no longer available, replaced by Ivy. Ivy is the future of Angular applications, and the benefits are tremendous. After initially landing in v12, Ivy paves the way for new feature updates, simplifies existing capabilities, and increases rendering performance.

                    <span>Using an interesting Pi setup (Chipsee CM4-156) I needed to install docker and the instructions on their site we&#x27;re slightly incorrect to get it installed
Kept getting an error when it tried to find a docker release for &#x27;buster&#x27; and that&#x27;s the latest version supported by this little &#x27;all in one&#x27; device
Here&#x27;s what I ran to get it working
This part is the same:
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release

Add their GPG Key (same from site):
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

[Different] Remove previous entry (this was added when the first install failed, you may have done the same)
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list

[Different] Work around to install the correct docker image:
sudo curl -sL https://get.docker.com | sed &#x27;s/9)/10)/&#x27; | sh

They also serve the same function, which is to serve as a proxy between clients and applications on one side, and to a postgres instance on the other side. In that position, the first obvious advantage is that it can perform as an edge service, concentrating connections from one network, and proxy the requests to the database in a non-exposed network.
Another advantage is that the client/application side connections are decoupled from the database side connections, and therefore can serve badly behaving applications (which create and destroy connections to a d‚Ä¶</span>
