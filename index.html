                    <span>As variáveis de ambiente permitem que nós possamos incluir no nosso código condições, parâmetros e valores diferentes de acordo com nosso ambiente. 
Imagine que você utilize uma API Rest de um serviço qualquer, seja ele criado internamente na empresa que você trabalha, seja ele de terceiros e que esse serviço ofereça um endpoint para homologação e outro para produção.
Uma abordagem inicial seria trocar os valores dessa api todas as vezes que quisermos publicar nossa aplicação em produção.
Uma abordagem muito mais elegante é configurar as variáveis de ambiente para que você não tenha que lembrar de trocar o conteúdo de nenhuma variável.
Aqui mostro como fazer isso utilizando o recurso de configuração de ambiente do Angular.
Projetos criados com Angular CLI possuem por padrão um arquivo de configuração chamado environment.ts disponível na pasta environments da sua aplicação.

environment.ts:
export const environment &#x3D; {
  production: false
};

environment.prod.ts
export const environment &#x3D; {
  production: true

Veja um exemplo de como usar o environment.

This was my 1st time being a Contrbutor &amp; Maintainer in Hactoberfest. I&#x27;m a new Bootcamp Grad &amp; Developer and this event was a great opportunity to contribute to Open Source Projects.   
Looking at the many open source projects I decided I wanted to do more than just contribute. For a while, I&#x27;ve wanted to do a Female Tech Pioneers Web API/React App after noticing that there aren&#x27;t many sources online of just Females in Tech.

Do you use functions / methods to implement various conditions and DOM manipulations in Angular ? If yes, trust me it will worsen your website performance. In this tutorial I will explain how pipes increase your angular website performance and what are the various benefits of using Pipe over Functions based on a case study.
Before diving straight into tutorial, let’s start with some basic questions.
The first question comes in mind- What is Pipe? A simple definition of pipe- it is a decorative function in Angular used to manipulate DOM. It takes an untransformed value as input and returns a transformed value as output.
Various built-in pipes are provided by Angular- AsyncPipe, CurrencyPipe,…</span>

                    <span>👋 hi all - this article is a continuation of a previous article that explains the goals of the DeRxJS pattern:
entirely de-couple state management code from presentational code (to the point where your state management code could be re-used across frameworks)
maximize the benefits of RxJS, while minimizing the negatives
next-level testing [and potential to hand over all our state-management code to AI at some point]
In that article, we did most of the heavy lifting - developing our state-management code and fully testing out every edge case with &quot;timeline testing&quot; (allowing us to assert not only &quot;what&quot; state looks like, but &quot;when&quot; it should look that way as well).
In this article, we&#x27;ll bring that state management code and show how we can use this across 3 front-end &quot;frameworks&quot;: React, A…</span>

                    <span>Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
In lay mans language i would define docker as a platform that enables you build once and deploy everywhere.Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure, therefore you wont have to set up all the dependencies your apps need all over again and again as you migrate between different environments
Before proceeding further it is important to highlight some important concepts that you will commonly hear of in the docker world .This are:
A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software .For example we have a mysql image which includes everything needed to run mysql: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings
The hub is a repository where container images are stored. You can get public images as well as store your own private images.
Docker Container is a layer of images .

Docker images become containers when they run on Docker Engine.

Docker Engine is the runtime environment for all containers. Docker engine can be used in both linux and windows based infrastructure. A docker application can easily be run in any environment as long as there is a docker engine.
This solves the “dependency hell” for developers and operations teams, and eliminating the “it works on my laptop!” problem.

Before understanding the difference between Docker and Virtual machines its important to understand Operating systems. Operating systems have an application and kernel layer

Docker virtualizes the application layer and use the kernel of the host while a virtual machines virtualizes both application &amp; kernel layer.
Docker size is small a couple of megabytes while a virtual machine size is large a couple of gigabytes .
Docker is faster while a virtual machines size is slower.</span>

                    <span>Chapter 3: Deployment Strategy for Microservices.


Chapter 2 provided an overview of the proposed infrastructure, and explained the different components used, along with its advantages. However, the aforementioned infrastructure is only as robust as the environment hosting the microservices. In fact, an improper deployment of microservices may lead to numerous problems, namely, bottlenecks, single point of failure, increased downtimes, and many more.
This chapter promotes one way of deploying microservices, along with some best practices, in order to achieve security, scalability, and availability.

                    <span>Given


that I am dyslexic and also suffer from aphantasia, which is a fascinating quirk of the brain, one  can imagine I have sort of a love / hate relationship with reading. 
On the one hand, I must keep up with the news and trends of the software engineering industry but the serious and useful information I require, is in written form and that always drains my reading battery because of the above average amount of concentration I have to put forward.
daylight saving Weekend rolled around, I decided to do something useful with the &quot;additional&quot; hour, so I set out to improve this situation for people like me. 
I decided to build something that allows us to take the text from any article in any language (English, German, Romanian in my case) and convert it to an mp3 file so that we can &quot;lis…</span>

                    <span>One of the most time-consuming and frustrating aspects of computational tasks has always been properly installing software and getting it up and running in no time. In the case of bioinformatics tools, this is notoriously difficult in some cases, particularly in Linux-based operating systems such as Ubuntu, where one-click installer files, unlike Windows, are not an option. Although much of the popular software in the bioinformatics world is easy to install in Ubuntu if one is familiar with the ecosystem, a beginner will certainly have a difficult time circling the internet trying to find a proper installation method, at least, that’s what I had to go through when I first started out.
Here in this article, I compiled out the installation methods of some of the most commonly used bioinformatics and simulation tools, as well as how to run these tools after installing them on an Ubuntu 20.04 machine. Feel free to let me know which software should be added next.

                    <span>It feels like a lot of people on here who use Linux like to talk about Linux. I am not an exception, so here&#x27;s my journey/opinions on Linux.
My first exposure to Linux was in a virtual machine and it was OpenSUSE. Which I remember very little about now, except that I thought it was quite fun. I mostly just looked at it a bit, but I liked it.
When Netbooks came out, you could get a 9 inch one with Linux on it. I don&#x27;t remember which distro was on it, but it wasn&#x27;t a common one. I don&#x27;t think it said when it was sold, I googled to find out. It was more of a useful little computer to have on your lap on the sofa for odd little bits, so the OS didn&#x27;t make a great deal of difference. But the computer not being very powerful meant Linux was better on it than Windows.

                    <span>Background


I always forget to turn off the EC2 instance when I am not using the computer. Because of this, I always end up paying tons for forgetting to turn it off. The cost of these EC2 instances are usually $1 per hour. Hence, if I forget to turn it off for a whole day, I would incur $24.
This feels like something the machine should do itself and not burden me for remembering. Hence, I have gathered information from all over the web to make this short, simple and easy to follow guide.
First, we need a script that checks if there is a user connecting through SSH and turn off the EC2 instance if there are none for a set interval of time. The following script does exactly that:
#!/bin/bash

For this week, I have chosen to work on this repository: link. The issue that was asked from the creator was to implement jwt tokens that should be returned when a user authenticates themselves into the program.
The issue could be found here: issue link
I have made a PR with my changes, which could be found here:

Here is my commit link:commit
Currently, I am waiting for the owner to add the Hacktoberfest label to the issue, as well as review my PR.</span>

                    <span>A basic definition


Express middlewares are the functions that have access to the request, response and next function in applications request response cycle. The next function calls the next middleware that is succeding the current middleware.
Let&#x27;s simplify the above statement a bit. So a express middleware is basically a function that has req,res and next as a parameters. For example,
const express &#x3D; require(&#x27;express&#x27;)
const app &#x3D; express()

function logger(req, res, next) {
  console.log(&quot;I am a middleware and I log the text&quot;);
  next();
}
app.use(logger)
app.get(&#x27;/&#x27;, (req,res)&#x3D;&gt;{
 res.send(&quot;Hellow World!!&quot;)
})
app.listen(3000)

Now here I have a logger function which is a middleware. Yup that&#x27;s how simple a middleware can be. Here the logger function has one thing which other function…</span>

                    <span>In this article, I am gonna tell you about how you can run the Heroku server free for a lifetime. So let&#x27;s get into it.
As you may have known that Heroku does not allow your app to run for more than 1 hour. When an app on Heroku has only one web dyno and that dyno doesn&#x27;t receive any traffic in 1 hour, the dyno goes to sleep.
When someone accesses the app, the dyno manager automatically wakes up the web dyno to run the web process type. This causes a short delay for this first request, but subsequent requests perform normally.
So now how can we run it forever without sleep? so that web process or API request doesn&#x27;t have any kind of delay.
Heroku


Firstly you need to have a Heroku app which can be a new or old one. if you don&#x27;t have a Heroku app Click Here

Express.js is a popular backend web application framework for Node.js. While setting up your routes you might encounter scenarios where you need to fetch the parameters specified in the URL path to retrieve a particular set of data. This article will take you through how to extract values from URL route and query parameters. 
We recommend you have some basic experience with Javascript and NodeJS and have setup simple routes using Express.js before you go on with this guide.
A Query String is the part that comes after the Question mark ? in a URL. Let&#x27;s take an example URL.
https://example.com/api/users?type&#x3D;admin&amp;status&#x3D;active

The URL above fetches a list of users with a type of admin and status is active .To fetch these values in Express you can access t…</span>

                    <span>In previous articles, we talked about design documents and how to use views to query in CouchDB. Besides Javascript query server, CouchDB also has a built-in Mango query server for us to query documents. Therefore in this article, I will talk about what is Mango Query, and when to use Mango Query?
Mango is a MongoDB inspired query language interface for Apache CouchDB.
Mango provides a single HTTP API endpoint that accepts JSON bodies via HTTP POST. These bodies provide a set of instructions that will be handled with the results being returned to the client in the same order as they were specified. The general principle of this API is to be simple to implement on the client side while providing users a more natural conversion to Apache CouchDB than would otherwise exist using the standard …</span>

console.table()

                    <span>Hawk is a network and pentest utility that I developed so that I could perform different kinds of task using the same suite, instead of jumping from one tool to another.
ifconfig, 
ping, 
traceroute, 
port scans (including SYN, TCP, UDP, ACK, comprehensive scan), 
host discovery (scan for up devices on a local network), 
MAC address detection (get MAC address of a host IP on a local network), 
banner grabbing, 
DNS checks (with geolocation information), 
WHOIS, 
subdomain enumeration, 
vulnerability reconnaissance, - 
packet sniffing, 
MAC spoofing, 
IP spoofing, 
SYN flooding, 
deauth attack, 
brute-force attack (beta).
Other features are still being implemented. Future implementations may include WAF detection, DNS enumeration, traffic analysis, XSS vulnerability scanner, ARP cache poisoning, DNS cache poisoning, MAC flooding, ping of death, network disassociation attack (not deauth attack), OSINT, exploits, some automated tasks and others.

                    <span>Looking For an Issue


The last issue for the #Hacktoberfest challenge was really difficult to find.
After a long time of trying to find an issue with no luck, I decided to cheat a little and see what repos my classmates were contributing to. Funnily enough, I noticed that 3 of my classmates contributed to the same repo - usTaxes. This made me wonder what was so special about that repo, like why would my classmates care about US Taxes in Canada?? Or even generally care about taxes 😵 So I decided to take a look at that repo and see what&#x27;s going on. I still don&#x27;t know why they would choose it but I noticed that it had quite a few issues that were manageable and straightforward. So I decided to try and see how it goes, even though I&#x27;m not interested in taxes 😅

This time it took me quite a while to find another issue to work on. There were so many repos that I found that weren&#x27;t active, didn&#x27;t have any open issues, or the issues were too complicated/already assigned to someone else. I didn&#x27;t expect that finding issues would be that hard!🥵🙈 
Eventually, I remembered one of the repos that I&#x27;ve used before to contribute to one of the Hacktoberfest issues, I thought that it would be nice to give back (hint hint😉😉😉 something to think about when looking for an issue... hint😉) to that repo. I quickly gave up everything I was doing and went to check it out to see if it is even active and if it has any open issues I could work on. To my surprise, no one except the author has ever contributed to that before, so I am…</span>

                    <span>(Examples taken from howtographql)
Welcome to the second part of Learn GraphQL With Me. In this post we will be learning about some core concepts related to GraphQL. These concepts are language independent, so it means that you do not need to know any particular language to understand these, as these are GraphQL specific, and once understood can be implemented in any language.
One thing to keep in mind here is that as GraphQL is different from REST and SOAP, you need to try to understand this little differently as GraphQL has its own specific concepts, which are independent of any other type of API.
So let&#x27;s finally begin learning GraphQL.
GraphQL has its own type system for defining schemas, like we do for modelling the database tables (for SQL) and documents (for NoSQL). This is called the SDL or the Schema Definition Language. 
So this is how you define schemas or types in GraphQL:
type Person {
    name: String!
    age: Int!
}

Notice how we have ! after the data types String and Int. This tells that &#x27;name&#x27; and &#x27;age&#x27; are compulsory. If we just wrote name as name: String, this would have meant that it is not compulsory that Person has a name.
Let&#x27;s also add a Post type to our schema:
type Post {
    title: String!
}

Now what if we want to have relations between the Post and the Person type. We can now use Person and Post as a data type, like we use String, Int. So let&#x27;s define an author field, which is of type Person.
type Post {
    title: String!
    author: Person!
}

This tells that a Post will have an author who will be a Person. But we also want to say that a Person can write many posts, so how do we do that. Let&#x27;s add a posts field to Person type which will be an array of type Post.
type Person {
    name: String!
    age: Int!
    posts: [Post!]!
}

Notice how we have ! after Post as well as after ], this tells that the array is compulsory as well as there has to be some data of type Post inside it.</span>

Maybe we learn new things that invalidate or challenge our previous thinking. Or we realise that patterns that we thought ideal would not scale to the level we now need them to.
Quite some time has passed since I first started to use React Query. I think I learned a great deal on that journey, and I&#x27;ve also &quot;seen&quot; a lot. I want my blog to be as up-to-date as possible, so that you can come back here and re-read it, knowing that the concepts are still valid.

                    <span>Over the Hacktoberfest I had been slowly working on finding issues and completing some PRs from the open source community. Similar to my first PR I did I found another fairly simple typescript issue to help contribute to for the toynet-react repo. This issue was a pretty simple one, I just needed to fix the header of a component to be the proper sizing. While working on this one I got the chance to learn about the component library chakra. Chakra is a really cool component library for React applications that provides a whole bunch of building block components to easily make a React application. It makes creating different components really easy and looks very clean as well. There are a bunch of easy to use customizations for each component and seems pretty flexible as well. This library is definitely something I wanna remember to try out when I am working with React. So thanks to chakra my solution was very simple, I just needed to use chakra&#x27;s Heading component to fix the header for the component. You can checkout the PR here.</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://dev.to/this-is-angular/simplifying-angular-testbed-setup-by-converting-to-synchronous-test-hooks-19cl">

                    <span>When we use Angular&#x27;s schematics to generate components, unnecessary asynchronous code is added to the test setup hook for its test suite.
The following test setup is generated by Angular&#x27;s component generation schematic:
beforeEach(async () &#x3D;&gt; {
  await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  }).compileComponents();
});

component schematic.





Alternatively, we might be using Angular&#x27;s waitForAsync test function wrapper (formerly named async) as seen in the following code snippet:
beforeEach(waitForAsync(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  }).compileComponents();
}));

waitForAsync.





Here&#x27;s the deal: It&#x27;s only necessary to call the static TestBed.compileComponents method if we&#x27;re not using the Angular CLI to run our tests (who would do such a thing, Google? 👈😏).
The Angular CLI compiles our application and tests before the tests are run so no asynchronous action is needed for setting up the declarables.
Let&#x27;s simplify the common test setup by leaving out async-await, waitForAsync, and even the TestBed.createComponent invocation as seen in this code snippet:
beforeEach(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  });
});

The following points are true for common Angular testbed setup for tests covering all types of Angular declarables:
No need to use async-await
No need to use waitForAsync (formerly named async)
No need to call TestBed.compileComponents



Of course, there might be other reasons for introducing asynchronicity to our test setup but compiling and linking declarables is not one of them.
Enjoy a little less boilerplate in your Angular tests 🌞</span>

AWS App Runner is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to quickly deploy containerized web applications and APIs at scale and with no prior infrastructure experience required. Start with your source code or a container image. App Runner automatically builds and deploys the web application, and load balances traffic with encryption. App Runner also scales up or down automatically to meet your traffic needs. With App Runner, you have more time to focus on your applications rather than thinking about servers or scaling.

As a developer, We work on different projects. Some of the projects (having oAuth or constant ports) work on only specific ports. For example, I&#x27;ve a project which always run on 8080. If any other process is using this port, I&#x27;ve to stop that process and then restart the project. 
docker containers from other projects run 
We can stop specific container by going to the specific directory and then running the following command



docker-compose down // this will shut down all the containers running in that docker environment

Additionally, to prevent a specific container from auto starting when a system is powered on (started), we can run following command

You could use Platforms as a Service (PAAS) sites like Heroku and you can link your github repo to Heroku and deploy from there. At the time of writing that costs $7/month (roughly £5/month)
But there is a more Devops pro like way which may be more customisable. 
Digital Ocean (the lowest version is $5/month or £3.65 /month) which also offers a PAAS or Infrastructure as a service (IAAS).

You can pay per month to run your code on one of their private virtual servers which they call &#x27;Droplets&#x27;. Hence the digital ocean...

The Raspberry Pi 4 offers an excellent upgrade to the preceding Pi 3B+, but keeping the new model from overheating can be a challenge. Users have tried many techniques to tackle this issue, from running the Pi in the open air to utilizing cooling rigs with fans attached. But as vertical cases are gaining popularity, can my DIY vertical case keep the Broadcom BCM2711B0 quad-core A72 SOC (system on chip)—cool? Spoiler alert: Surprisingly, yes.
First of all, why subject your Raspberry Pi to this level of stress? In the case of Raspberry Pi 4, the A72 CPU is so powerful that it can overheat if it doesn&#x27;t have enough cooling. This results in the CPU being thermal throttled (governed) to reduce the power consumption and in turn reducing heat generation. The …</span>

                    <span>A private bug bounty program I am on had a scope increase recently.
*target.com

amass does not seem to have a feature that handles this sort of search, so I generated that list in bash/zsh:
for i in $(cat mylist.txt); do 
    echo $itarget.com &gt;&gt; potential-targets; 
done

This is for only one target. If your list containing multiple targets is in targets.txt, do:
for i in $(cat targets.txt); do 
    for j in $(cat mylist.txt); do
        echo $j$i &gt;&gt; potential-targets.txt; 
    done
done

This can yield a big file. To compress it after creation:
gzip -9 potential-targets.txt

To zip them during creation:
for i in $(cat targets.txt); do 
    for j in $(cat mylist.txt); do
        echo $j$i | gzip -9 &gt;&gt; potential-targets.txt.gz; 
    done
done

Once you&#x27;ve created the list of targets and zipped them, lets say we want to find all of the potentials yielding actual pages with content. Fire up httpx:
zcat potential-targets.txt.gz | \
httpx -no-fallback -o httpx.txt

Because this can take a long time, you might consider lowering the timeout, or using more or less threads:
zcat potential-targets.txt.gz | \
httpx -no-fallback -o httpx.txt -threads 200 -timeout 1

Lets say you didn&#x27;t zip potential-targets. That&#x27;s ok. httpx has an option to read directly from file. Everyone online is so obsessed with piping output because they think it is cool, but encouraging people to merely copy/paste data results in bad thinking and approach.
httpx -l potential-targets.txt -no-fallback \
-o httpx.txt -threads 200 -timeout 1

This will run for a long time. I was running it with default timeout and 8 threads on 300,000+ possible names and it had not completed after several hours. I&#x27;m running it now on a much larger namespace and even though it is taking a long time, I am already yielding new names that did not show up in amass.

                    <span>Hello there !
Simply, I want that very ancient one to one messaging based on logged users (not bound to any SMTP servers or APIs, even If I use users oAuth and I have emails).
Whatever keywords I search with, I find sockets and real-time messaging everywhere. No one mentions internal and private users messaging nowhere. Unbelievable 😡.
You could suggest any real-time many-to-many solution and assume theoretically we can limit messaging to one-to-one, private, but no, 
The only scenario possible: A user is interested in one listing, he/she sends a message to the author of the thread, then they can chat about that in a small time window (2 days or something). This is important as I don&#x27;t want my site to be a chatting platform.
So to sum up, I&#x27;m looking for an open-source NodeJS solution even some part of a NodeJS project that I can pick. Ready made to not reinvent the wheel, and because I&#x27;m tired of this project ;(
Many thanks !!!! and no open source solutions like Slack 😡😡 you now know why 😂
You can snitch on my profile on a French website and what I&#x27;m selling 😂</span>

                    <span>In this articles, I will talk about how to query documents in Apache CouchDB via Views.
A short introduce about CouchDB first for those who don&#x27;t know. Apache CouchDB is an open-source document-oriented NoSQL database, implemented in Erlang. It is very easy to use as CouchDB makes use of the ubiquitous HTTP protocol and JSON data format. Do check out their Official Website for more detail. 😉
Alright, back to our main topic today.✌
First of all, before we talk about what is view, I need to introduce 2 important things in CouchDB.
The first thing to introduce is CouchDB Query Server. What is Query Server? Based on the official documentation:
The Query server is an external process that communicates with CouchDB by JSON protocol through stdio interface and processes all design functions call…</span>

                    <span>In this article I&#x27;m going to assume you have a working Node js app locally. In a terminal you type in npm start and whoosh we have a working node app locally. However how do you deploy it to the internet? 
You could use Platforms as a Service (PAAS) sites like Heroku and you can link your github repo to Heroku and deploy from there. At the time of writing that costs $7/month (roughly £5/month)
But there is a more Devops pro like way which may be more customisable. 
Digital Ocean (the lowest version is $5/month or £3.65 /month) which also offers a PAAS or Infrastructure as a service (IAAS).

You can pay per month to run your code on one of their private virtual servers which they call &#x27;Droplets&#x27;. Hence the digital ocean...

                    <span>The Wikipedia description of a JSON Web Token (JWT) is:
JSON Web Token is a proposed Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption 
However, this definition says a lot without really saying a lot. When I&#x27;m trying to understand a concept, I like to play around with relevant libraries. We&#x27;ll try this out with JWTs using the popular javascript library jsonwebtoken.
The first thing the docs mention is that the sign function returns a 
secret.
const jwtLibrary &#x3D; require(&#x27;jsonwebtoken&#x27;);

// The only arguments we need are a secret value and some JSON
const json &#x3D; {&quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot;, &quot;key2&quot;: &quot;value2&quot;}

                    <span>Hey everyone! I&#x27;ve recently created an Elasticsearch Typescript template so you can get started using TS &amp; Elasticsearch. 
Elasticsearch is a open-source search engine built on Apache Lucene and developed in Java. Elasticsearch allows you to store &amp; search huge volumes of data very quickly in near real-time and give back responses in milliseconds. Yes you heard that right milliseconds... It&#x27;s able to achieve these fast search speeds/responses because instead of searching the text directly, it searches through an index. It uses a structure based on documents instead of tables and schemas.
I created this template because I haven&#x27;t seen many templates for Elasticsearch &amp; Typescript and even tutorials covering this so I decided to create one to make peoples lives easier.
You can get started here!, Just follow the README on how to setup your environment variables, and setting up the server.
⭐s are much appreciated! :)</span>

This time, I will try searching local files and returning them for getting requests.
Node.js ver.17.0.1
TypeScript ver.4.4.4
Express ver.4.17.1
ts-node ver.10.4.0
I want to get files from these directories.
sample_files
    L type1
        L subFolder
            L こんにちは.txt
        L webrtc_image.pptx
    L type2
        L sub folder
            L こんにちは.txt
    L Hello world!.txt

I can get directory and file informations by &quot;fs.promises.readdir&quot;.
import fs from &quot;fs&quot;;

async function getFilePath(): Promise {
    const directory &#x3D; &quot;C:/Users/example/OneDrive/Documents/workspace/express-sample/sample_files&quot;;

                    <span>Finally, I&#x27;ve got my 4th pull request merged. 
I was looking some good issues in repos that I have starred and I found the issue Update CreateEvent to deal with repository creation. 
This is the live feed of the website and it failed to display the message whenever someone would create a new repo in the organization. 

Let&#x27;s take a look at how the front-end component deals with the REST endpoint

    case &#x27;DeleteEvent&#x27;: {
      const target &#x3D; payload?.ref;

      if (!targetType || !target) {
        return unknown;
      }
      return {action} {targetType} {target} in;
    }

      &quot;pusher_type&quot;: &quot;user&quot;
    },

Since ref is null when a user creates a new repo, the code returns the default message unknown. Therefore, adding a condition should fix it.
      if (!target) {
        return {action} the {targetType} ;
      }
      if (!targetType) {
        return unknown;
      }

Though the issue wasn&#x27;t hard to solve, I found it more valuable getting to know the project&#x27;s workflow. I got to learn about husky, pre-commit hooks and how to make sure code linting has no error before passing the PR tests as well as GitHub API.</span>

                    <span>One of the most powerful features when creating Angular components is the Async Pipe. The greatest thing about it is that it allows you to take advantage of asynchronous rendering in your templates, but without having to worry about subscribing and unsubscribing from Observables.
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;
import { of, Subject } from &#x27;rxjs&#x27;;
import { delay, startWith, takeUntil } from &#x27;rxjs/operators&#x27;;

@Component({
  selector: &#x27;my-app&#x27;,
  template: &#x60;
    
Async example
 
    
Items
 
    
{{item}}
Other Items
 
    
{{other}}
 this.otherItems &#x3D; other)
  }
  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.destroy$.next();
    this.destroy$.complete();
  }
}


Check it out on Stackblitz.
As you can see, in the first example, we are rendering a list (items) using the async pipe in the HTML template. There is no need for the additional handling after the component is destroyed, which you can see is not the case for the other list otherItems.   That is simply because the async pipe is going to take care of that for you.</span>

1. Ivy Everywhere
In Angular 12, View Engine is deprecated, and the community is working on ongoing delivery towards the goal of amalgamating the ecosystem of Angular on Ivy. Current libraries still use View Engine. But the library authors want to shift to Ivy. AngularJS development services become easy with Ivy as developers can compile all components independently and enhances development times.
2. Adios Protractor

                    <span>As we know multiple components share the common data and always need updated shared data. In such scenarios most of the time BehaviorSubject is used which acts as a single store to hold updated shared data.
BehaviorSubject is both observer and type of observable.
BehaviorSubject always need an initial/default value.
Every observer on subscribe gets current value.
Current value is either latest value emitted by source observable using next() method or initial/default value.
Let’s implement BehaviorSubject to understand a concept better!
For e.g In order tracking app, display total items in cart and total items in wish list on UI in header and dashboard section based on user action.
Now we have three components -

Run Live
When user add items in the cart/wishList, total count needs to be updated in the header and dashboard component.
1.First create a BehaviorSubject in order service which holds the initial state of order count ,so that it can be used by any component.




3.When a user performs any action, call the next() method of BehaviorSubject. When the next() method gets called it will update current count with new count and notifies updated count to all observers(3 Components) who subscribed to source observable.

This way BehaviorSubject makes components communication more effective.

                    <span>Hi everyone. I&#x27;ve been fighting with VSCode for almost two weeks now.
VSC keeps freezing my whole system randomly while working.
FiveServer
Pretier
Aura Theme
Tabnine (free)
I&#x27;ve tried working with and without extensions, with the same result.
I&#x27;ve even tried to run VSC from console with --disable-gpu attr.
Freezing is random. Sometimes while typing, sometimes when switching windows between VSC and FF.
First thought there is a problem with FF but then it froze wit only VSC lunched :/
Does anyone had the same problem?
I really liked working with VSC.
I&#x27;ve tried Atom as a replacement, but not like it so much.
WEBSTORM is cool but it&#x27;s overkill for me for now.</span>

There&#x27;s a lot of information out there about adding authentication to your app, which is helpful! But also overwhelming. It can be hard to find relevant and up-to-date information. Security best practices and technologies change, so refreshing your understanding and keeping up with current best practices is a good thing. Here are some notes I took while I reviewed my knowledge and applied my experience implementing auth.

If you&#x27;re implementing authentication to a new application, the best practice is to use OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect (OIDC). The combination of OAuth 2.0 with OIDC provides consistency across many integration providers, standardi…</span>

Hello, and welcome!
It&#x27;s another Friday. Let&#x27;s get down to business.
Most of the news that we&#x27;ll review this week is about vulnerabilities and bugs.
Popular NPM Package Hijacked to Publish Crypto-mining Malware


As a developer, reading articles like this makes me think twice before downloading a package from NPM, but sometimes, you might need that package so bad, you&#x27;ll forget about &quot;security&quot;.
Excerpt from the article:
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Friday warned of crypto-mining and password-stealing malware embedded in &quot;UAParser.js,&quot; a popular JavaScript NPM library with over 6 million weekly downloads, days after the NPM repository moved to get rid of three rogue packages that were found to mimic the same library

                    <span>Many people are concerned about how much personal information is stored on the internet and could be stolen or misused in today&#x27;s reality. You&#x27;re not the only one who feels this way. The issue of online privacy is crucial.
You can improve your online security against unwanted access to your data and privacy by taking several simple actions.
1 
Browse in private mode or use a browser, which doesn&#x27;t store and send your data.
Browsing in private mode can let you avoid your browser&#x27;s history from tracing. However, these private modes aren&#x27;t entirely private. Your ISP can observe your surfing behavior even if you&#x27;re using an incognito or private mode.
e.g.
https://www.brave.com/
https://www.beakerbrowser.com/
2 
Be cautious about where you click.
Phishing attempts are one of the ways how hackers can compromise your online privacy. They frequently accomplish this by sending fake emails that look like from banks, credit card companies, etc. 
3 
Change your search engine.
If you&#x27;re like most web users, you use Google as your primary search engine.
e.g.
https://www.duckduckgo.com/
https://www.startpage.com/
4
Use dedicated proxy servers. 
A dedicated proxy server acts as a private and secure connection point between users and the internet. It&#x27;s a server that acts as an &quot;intermediary&quot; between end-users and the web pages they browse on the internet. An IP address is used when a computer connects to the internet.
You can compare it to your home&#x27;s street address. It directs data to the appropriate destination while also providing a return address for other devices.
A dedicated proxy server is a machine connected to the internet that has its unique IP address and serves as a disguise for your computer.
There are plenty of companies that provide such services, here is my personal top of the most reliable ones:

                    <span>We often use Azure Web App and Key Vault together to protect keys/secrets/certificates.
To read certificates from Key Vault by using system assigned managed identity of App Service, there are several things to do.
From WebApp, enable managed identity.

From Key Vault access policy, assign certificate get permission (or any other additional required permissions) for the managed id.
From WebApp configurations menu, add WEBSITE_LOAD_USER_PROFILE application setting and set value to 1.</span>

But they are a fact of life when you&#x27;re working with Git, especially when you&#x27;re teaming up with other developers. In most cases, merge conflicts aren&#x27;t as scary as you might think. In this fourth part of our “Advanced Git” series we&#x27;ll talk about when they can happen, what they actually are, and how to solve them.

                    <span>MedSec is a network and pentest utility that I developed so that I could perform different kinds of task using the same suite, instead of jumping from one tool to another.
Currently, this script can perform a good variety of tasks such as ifconfig, ping, traceroute, port scans (including SYN, TCP, UDP, ACK, comprehensive scan, host discovery (scan for up devices on a local network), MAC address detection (get MAC address of a host IP on a local network), banner grabbing, DNS checks (with geolocation information), WHOIS, subdomain enumeration, vulnerability reconnaissance, packet sniffing, MAC spoofing, IP spoofing, SYN flooding, deauth attack and brute-force attack (beta).
Other features are still being implemented. Future implementations may include WAF detection, DNS enumeration, traffic analysis, XSS vulnerability scanner, ARP cache poisoning, DNS cache poisoning, MAC flooding, ping of death, network disassociation attack (not deauth attack), OSINT, exploits, some automated tasks and others.

                    <span>Introduction


The security alarm system will use a bipolar junction transistor switch to detect security problems. Theft attempt and other security threats can be controlled by using this simple circuit.
For the purpose of this application, we will design a security system for one room in a house. The sensor used for each opening can be either a mechanical switch, a magnetically operated switch, or an optical sensor. Detection of an intrusion can be used to initiate an audible alarm signal. 
We will be using a mechanical switch as our sensor and use a transistor as a NOT gate, so that when there is an open switch in our room a transistor will show a signal that an intruder has entered.
Resistor
Transistor
Buzzer
Voltage source

Room sensor is normally in a closed position and it is connected to a DC voltage source. When a door is open it creates an open circuit.


Transistor switches are used for high power devices such as
The areas of operation for Transistor switch are known as the Saturation Region and the Cut-Off Region.
Cut-off Region: here there is a large depletion layer


Saturation Region: here the depletion layer is as




  
  
  NOT Gate Transistor


A NOT gate simply inverts its input. If the input is high, the output is low, and if the input is low, the output is high

The operation of this circuit is simple. The input is connected through resistor R2 to the transistor’s
When voltage is present at the input, the transistor turns on, allowing current to flow through the collector-emitter circuit directly to ground. This ground path creates a shortcut that bypasses the output, which causes the output to go low.
We run our simulation with a voltmeter connected to the output, in place of the buzzer .

In the normal state, the switch will be closed.

When intrusion happens, the switch will open and the alarm (buzzer) will go off.</span>

                    <span>In the “Leveraging Salesforce Using Spring Boot” article, I navigated the course for introducing a Spring Boot service that would leverage the well-established Salesforce RESTful API. The goal of this service was to act as a middleware layer; that way, clients not written in Salesforce could retrieve and update contact data stored in Salesforce. This backend service implemented its own caching layer to provide a faster response time and also cut down on the number of times Salesforce needed to be called.
In “Leveraging Salesforce Using a Client Written In Svelte,” I introduced a simple client written in Svelte, which made it possible to update the Salesforce data using an inline editor—again, without actually using the Salesforce client.

                    <span>Security is hard. It&#x27;s hard because there are so many things that can go wrong along the way. Attackers only need to find one small gap to make it through whereas developers and IT Pros have to think about all the possible attack permutations and potential security vulnerabilities every step of the way. That&#x27;s why we talk about &quot;security in layers&quot; when it comes to building systems that handle sensitive data. And unless you&#x27;re creating static marketing pages, it&#x27;s very likely that your solution will need to work with some data.

                    <span>Background


Ubuntu 21.10 can load on my computer through secure boot, and the shim version is 15.4. Then refer to the official tutorial, I installed rEFInd v0.13.2 (the latest version when I posted this blog) via PPA in Ubuntu 21.10. However, when I restart the system and load rEFInd, it always fails with the message Verification failed:(0x1A)Security Violation. I&#x27;m sure that both refind_local.cer and refind.cer under the EFI/refind/keys/ have been enrolled through MokManager (Although only refind_local.cer is needed through PPA installation).
From this post, I got that rEFInd currently (v0.13.2) lacks the .sbat section. For shim 15.3 and later versions, SBAT is mandatory, resulting in failure to start rEFInd.
The post also indicates that the author of rEFInd is currently studying how to …</span>

                    <span>Recently at work, I came across an interesting method to handle encryption at scale called envelope encryption. 
First of all, it increases security and helps you ease out the management of encryption keys. But it&#x27;s also a highly recommended pattern by PCI-DSS (Security Standard for Credit Card Processing) and results in much stronger data privacy and data protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). 
When we think of data there are 3 places we can think of encrypting data:
At Rest - On hardware storage devices like on a disk or in your devices 
In Transit - In moving data between different locations like server to server through API calls
In Use - While it&#x27;s being used by a server (New concept and still being researched)
We will be dealing primarily with encryption at rest and…</span>
