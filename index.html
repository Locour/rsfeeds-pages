                    <span>Concatenation means to join items end to end. JavaScript offers the concat method for both strings and arrays that work in the same way. For arrays, the method is called on one, then another array is provided as the argument to concat, which is added to the end of the first array. It returns a new array and does not mutate either of the original arrays. 
Here&#x27;s an example:




[10, 20, 30].concat([40, 50, 60]);

The returned array would be [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60].


Now let&#x27;s use the concat method in the nonMutatingConcat function to concatenate attach to the end of begin. The function should return the concatenated array.




function nonMutatingConcat(original, attach) {
  // Only change code below this line

  // Only change code above this line
}
var first &#x3D; [1, 2, 3];
var second &#x3D; [4, 5];
nonMutatingConcat(first, second);

Answer:




function nonMutatingConcat(original, attach) {
  return original.concat(attach)
}

var first &#x3D; [1, 2, 3];
var second &#x3D; [4, 5];
console.log(nonMutatingConcat(first, second)); // willreturn  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

                    <span>The slice method as we have already learned about returns a copy of certain elements of an array. It can take two arguments, the first gives the index of where to begin the slice, the second is the index for where to end the slice (and it&#x27;s non-inclusive). If the arguments are not provided, the default is to start at the beginning of the array through the end. The slice method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one.


Here&#x27;s an example:




var myarr &#x3D; [&quot;PS5&quot;, &quot;Switch&quot;, &quot;PC&quot;, &quot;Xbox&quot;];
var myConsoles &#x3D; myArr.slice(0, 3);

myConsoles would have the value [&quot;PS5&quot;, &quot;Switch&quot;, &quot;PC&quot;].


Alright then let&#x27;s use the slice method in the sliceArray function to return part of the anim array given the provided beginSlice and endSlice indices. The function should return an array.




function sliceArray(anim, beginSlice, endSlice) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}
var inputAnim &#x3D; [&quot;Cat&quot;, &quot;Dog&quot;, &quot;Tiger&quot;, &quot;Zebra&quot;, &quot;Ant&quot;];
sliceArray(inputAnim, 1, 3);

Answer:




function sliceArray(anim, beginSlice, endSlice) {
return anim.slice(beginSlice, endSlice);

}
var inputAnim &#x3D; [&quot;Cat&quot;, &quot;Dog&quot;, &quot;Tiger&quot;, &quot;Zebra&quot;, &quot;Ant&quot;];
console.log(sliceArray(inputAnim, 1, 3)); will display [&#x27;Dog&#x27;, &#x27;Tiger&#x27;]

                    <span>Continuing forward. You might learn a lot about the filter method if you implement your own version of it as well. It is recommended you use a for loop or Array.prototype.forEach().


Ex:




var s &#x3D; [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myFilter &#x3D; function(callback) {
  // Only change code below this line
  var newArray &#x3D; [];
  // Only change code above this line
  return newArray;
};

var new_s &#x3D; s.myFilter(function(item) {
  return item % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 1;
});

Answer:




var s &#x3D; [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myFilter &#x3D; function(callback) {

  var newArray &#x3D; [];
  for (let i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; this.length; i++) {
    if (callback(this[i]) &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; true) {
      newArray.push(this[i])
    }
  }
   return newArray;
};

var new_s &#x3D; s.myFilter(function(item) {
  return item % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 1;
});

new_s equals [23, 65, 5]

                    <span>There are several way resources can be created in Kubernetes. It is best practice to do it declarative via apply and yaml files. However, it can be a tedious task to write dozens of lines of error prone yaml by hand.
In this post I am going to explore options to to utilize kubectl imperative commands to bootstrap the declarative yaml files.  You can find the full code on github.
They key to this method is the dry-run flag. It allows to run the given command only partially. When paired with the -o flag we can generate a resource definition without actually creating the resource.
kubectl run my-app --image nginx --dry-run&#x3D;client -o yaml

                    <span>Ok then, another useful array function is Array.prototype.filter(), or simply filter().


filter calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new array containing only the elements for which that function returns true. In other words, it filters the array, based on the function passed to it. Like map, it does this without needing to modify the original array.


The variable watchList holds an array of objects with information on several movies. Use a combination of filter and map on watchList to assign a new array of objects with only title and rating keys. The new array should only include objects where imdbRating is greater than or equal to 8.0. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and you may need to convert them into numbers to perform mathematic‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>In this article, I‚Äôd like to demonstrate how you can deploy a static website with AWS by uploading your website content into S3 bucket, configuring your bucket for website hosting and speeding up content delivery using AWS CloudFront.
First of all, let me explain some of the terminologies.
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a service offered by AWS for object storage through a web service interface. It can be used to store or retrieve any amount of data such as documents, images, videos, etc.
S3 bucket is a resource in Amazon S3. It is a container where files and folders can be uploaded.
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service offered by AWS. It is used to speed up content delivery and can be integrated with Amazon S3.
Each object can contain up to 5TB of data.

                    <span>Alright so continuing where we left off last time, map is a pure function, and its output depends solely on its inputs. Plus, it takes another function as its argument.


You might learn a lot about themap method if you implement your own version of it. It is recommended you use a for loop or Array.prototype.forEach().


Ex:




var s &#x3D; [24, 55, 96, 4];

Array.prototype.myMap &#x3D; function(callback) {
  var newArray &#x3D; [];
  // Only change code below this line

  // Only change code above this line
  return newArray;
};

var new_s &#x3D; s.myMap(function(item) {
  return item * 2;
});

The Array instance can be accessed in the myMap method using this.




var s &#x3D; [24, 55, 96, 4];

Array.prototype.myMap &#x3D; function(callback) {
  var newArray &#x3D; [];

for (let i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; this.length; i++) { // &lt;---
  newArray.push(callback(this[i]))
}
  return newArray;
};

var new_s &#x3D; s.myMap(function(item) {
  return item * 2;
});

new_s should equal [48, 110, 192, 8].

I used expressjs to create a webserver, everything is working ok. I add the dist folder into .gitignore file, so the only file that got pushed to github repository is the src folder which mean the typescript file. And I want to connect Heroku and my github repository. The problem is, the file that should be in Heroku is the .js file, not the .ts.

                    <span>Whether you are looking to expand skills about linux. So, out of the hundreds of possible Linux commands you could or have to learn. Here some linux command you need to know.
The pwd command for to know you where you are now. For example your‚Äôre in download folder. Try the following type pwd and you will see that you‚Äôre in your download directory.
For Linux you can type clear or Ctrl+L to Clear the screen. It works in most terminal.
Command ls is equivalent to the DOS dir command, that it show lists files and directories. This command has some common attributes, example like:
ls -a for show all folders and files including visible and hidden.
ls -l for show the contents of the directory in full, starting from access rights, owner, group and the date the file or directory was created.
ls -i show directory contents and size.
For troubleshooting you can use command tail -f. Example like this tail -f /var/log/daemon.log.
If you want to see the previous commands, you can type history in your terminal. Meanwhile, to search command history in Linux, press ctrl+R, then just type the previous command you want to search or use.</span>

1. netstat:
netstat stands for Network Statistics. This is very basic command used to print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics etc.

Syntax:
netstat [OPTIONS]

There are various options which are supported by netstat command. Listing few of them in below
netstat -i: i stands for Interface.(Network Interface shows that how kernel links up with the software network side to the hardware network side.
Example:

netstat -r: r stands for Routing. It will show kernel IP routing tables.
Example:

2. nslookup:
nslookup stands for Name Server lookup. It helps us to check the IP address mapped to DNS(Domain Name System) and vice versa. This is very useful when we want to troubleshoot the DNS related issue.

The entire content credits goes to my instructor Brian Holt.
So without further ado, let&#x27;s get on with todays blog.

To learn about how Linux came to be, let‚Äôs go back to the beginning to 1969 where Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories developed the UNIX operating system. It was later rewritten in C to make it more portable and eventually became a widely used operating system.
A decade or so later, Richard Stallman started working on the GNU (GNU is Not UNIX) project, the GNU kernel called Hurd, which unfortunately never came to completion. The GNU General Public License (GPL), a free software li‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Hi!We use smartphone,laptop and other devices. All of them access to the internet. Many files have malware, If you install or use these files, you will have many problems also hackers can access to your data such as accounts and passwords.I wrote name of some apps that you should not use these apps. I will introduce more secure apps.











In conclusion
Many people think google is really safe but it isn&#x27;t!!!. Google apps are nice in the UI, services and etc,However in security doesn&#x27;t have standard features.I hope you enjoy this article if it is good, share with your friends and if you have any question or any other review, comment that.HAVE A NICE TIME AND GOOD SECURITY :).

Why a plugin system?


Let&#x27;s say I need to send queries to the database from different modules of my app. Should I connect to db, export the connection, and then import it in all modules where I need to use it? Well, it works but it results in a spaghetti code. This is where Fastify plugin system comes in handy. It let&#x27;s you to plug ( inject ) your dependencies to Fastify instance and then you can use them wherever you have access to the instance. It also helps you to move from a monolithic structure to microservices easily, because every service can be a plugin itself.

                    <span>This post assumes familiarity with NestJS and GraphQL.
In this post we will build a simple GraphQL API in NestJS that enables getting a list of posts. 
We will use the following GraphQL query:
query GetPosts {
  posts {
    id
    title
    body
    createdBy {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}

nest new example-app

This will generate a new NestJS app with the following structure:

After removing what we don&#x27;t need we are left with just app.module.ts and main.ts.
nest g module users

After generating module we will add user.entity.ts and users.service.ts:
user.entity.ts





export class User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

users.service.ts





import { Injectable } from &#x27;@nestjs/common&#x27;;

The Good
The Bad


Why don&#x27;t we script that?
What about Yarn?
Let&#x27;s get the simple solution out of the way first: Can&#x27;t we just move everything into different projects within the same repository?
To test that out let&#x27;s extract web and api into two separate apps, and make a libs folder for the shared dependencies. By moving the files around we end up with this structure:
webby
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ web/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libs
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analytics/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logging/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig-base.json

And if we look at web&#x27;s package.json we see a small list of dependencies that are used entirely by web:
    &quot;express&quot;: &quot;^4.17.1&quot;,
    &quot;react&quot;: &quot;^17.0.2&quot;,
    &quot;react-dom&quot;: &quot;^17.0.2&quot;,
    &quot;react-router-dom&quot;: &quot;^5.2.0&quot;,

The web servers and the browsers communicate with each other using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Making HTTP a protocol which allows the fetching of resources (like HTML documents).
HTTP follows a classic client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between requests.
When you are developing web applications, understanding and being able to test the behaviour of HTTP requests is a task you cannot overlook. 
There are many tools out there for API development. Among them, Postman is perhaps the most popular and well-known. However, if you use Visual Studio Code, you should definitely try REST Clien‚Ä¶</span>

The Attempts
I like simple code, in the &quot;low coupling, high cohesion&quot; sort of way where code is packaged into understandable, self-contained clumps that does an understandable &quot;thing&quot;. That way I don&#x27;t have to understand everything all at once, instead I can get an overview at the high-level and dive into the details when relevant to the work that needs doing.
We all chop our code into understandable abstractions already: We write functions and classes into separate files and folders. But as our project grows so does the need to keep organizing our code&#x27;s abstractions, and ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>In the last post, we were creating a common interface for creating express routes, thereby improving reusability. 
We now want to take it up a notch. How about having some fun with Builder Pattern, using plain old Javascript Functions.
So, I created a file RouteBuilder.js and it looks like this.
// RouteBuilder.js
const express &#x3D; require(&quot;express&quot;);

const RouteBuilder &#x3D; function () {
  this.path &#x3D; undefined; //string
  this.method &#x3D; undefined; //string
  this.middlewares &#x3D; undefined; //array of middlewares
  this.controller &#x3D; undefined; //final request handler
  this.router &#x3D; express.Router();

  this.setPath &#x3D; function (path) {
    this.path &#x3D; path;
    return this;
  };
  this.setMethod &#x3D; function (method) {
    this.method &#x3D; method;
    return this;
  };
  this.setMiddlewares &#x3D; function (middlewares) {
    this.middlewares &#x3D; middlewares;
    return this;
  };
  this.setController &#x3D; function (controller) {
    this.controller &#x3D; controller;
    return this;
  };
  this.build &#x3D; function () {
    this.router
      .route(this.path)
      [this.method.toLowerCase()](...this.middlewares, this.controller);
    return this.router;
  };
};

module.exports &#x3D; RouteBuilder;

and you can invoke this RouteBuilder like this
const RouteBuilder  &#x3D; require(&#x27;./RouteBuilder&#x27;);
const authMiddleware &#x3D; require(&quot;../authMiddleware&quot;)
const validateMiddleware &#x3D; require(&quot;../validateMiddleware&quot;)
const actionMiddleware &#x3D; require(&quot;actionMiddleware&quot;)
const serviceMiddleware&#x3D; require(&quot;serviceMiddleware&quot;)

const routeBuilder &#x3D; new RouteBuilder();

const userController &#x3D; (req, res, next) &#x3D;&gt; {
  res.send({});
};

//build the route
let route &#x3D; routeBuilder
  .setPath(&#x27;/&#x27;)
  .setMethod(&#x27;GET&#x27;)
  .setMiddlewares([
    authMiddleware,
    validateMiddleware,
    actionMiddleware,
    serviceMiddleware,
  ])
  .setController(userController)
  .build();

//Finally set the route to the app
app.use(&quot;/users&quot;, route); // here app is the express app.</span>

As team-lead you often have task to introduce your fellow team members into advanced concepts and way you want implementations to be delivered.
I use this combo of example project (I recommend to use it as template until person fully understands what he is doing) plus leading article, and usually that&#x27;s totally enough to kickoff new colleague, and turn him into effective team member within a few days.

                    <span>Nowadays, the web app codebase is increasing, and using a single script.js file to fit the entire javascript code in one file is not a good practice in terms of page load time. 
Let&#x27;s have a brief introduction about how a Modern Javascript Development Environment works.
We divide our entire project into multiple modules, then these modules can share data between them and make our code more organized and maintainable. Now what&#x27;s great about modules is we can use third-party modules within our application.

                    <span>Socket.IO helps in real-time, bi-directional and event-based communication between the browser and the server. socket.io is available on npm and it can be installed using the command
npm install socket.io

We create a http.server using the http createServer() method.
const http &#x3D; require(&#x27;http&#x27;);
const server &#x3D; http.createServer();

To start this server we need to use the listen method.
server.listen(port);

Now initialize the socket.io so that we can start listening the emitted events and also can emit the events. We can use the http.listen.createServer().
const io &#x3D; require(&#x27;socket.io&#x27;)(server);
// create a socket conection 
io.sockets.on(&#x27;connection&#x27;, function (socket) {
// receive the event &#x27;event name&#x27; 
  socket.on(&#x27;event name&#x27;, function (name) {
    //do action once socket event received
  });
});

There is no need of https.createServer(), http createServer() will work here.
Let&#x27;s setup the nginx to support the socket.io. If their is only single instance of Nodejs runnig then it won&#x27;t required any additional configuration but if their is multiple instance running then we need to make changes so that nginx forward the request from client to same port on which it was registered initially else server will send error session id unknown.
 upstream backend {
    ip_hash; // it is required so that socket.io request forward to the same port on which it was registered
    server ip_address;
}

server {
    server_name www.example.com;

    location / {
       proxy_pass http://backend;
    }

The Good
The Bad


Why don&#x27;t we script that?
What about Yarn?
Let&#x27;s get the simple solution out of the way first: Can&#x27;t we just move everything into different projects within the same repository?
To test that out let&#x27;s extract web and api into two separate apps, and make a libs folder for the shared dependencies. By moving the files around we end up with this structure:
webby
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ web/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libs
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analytics/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logging/
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig-base.json

And if we look at web&#x27;s package.json we see a small list of dependencies that are used entirely by web:
    &quot;express&quot;: &quot;^4.17.1&quot;,
    &quot;react&quot;: &quot;^17.0.2&quot;,
    &quot;react-dom&quot;: &quot;^17.0.2&quot;,

                    <span>Why should you use Typescript?


Simple. It solves your problem. Let&#x27;s see.
Type checking: This is why typescript really exist. It adds type checking over javascript. It stops you to write stupid code.

Let&#x27;s see an example:
const addNums &#x3D; (a, b) &#x3D;&gt; {
    return a + b
}

a and b should be number. But you stupidly pass strings.
addNums(&#x27;1&#x27;, &#x27;2&#x27;)

outupt:
&#x27;12&#x27;

We don&#x27;t want this to happen. It was a stupid example. But if you are working on bigger project, this kind of bug can happen easily. You waste hours and hours to fix the code. 

This where typescript rescues us with type checking.
const addNums &#x3D; (a: number, b: number) &#x3D;&gt; {
    return a + b
}

Now if you pass string it will give you error so that you can fix it.

The Two Extremes of Code Organization


Files &amp; Folders

Finding the middle ground


A note on TypeScript
I need your help!
So what&#x27;s the plan?
A quick word before we begin
The Attempts
I like simple code, in the &quot;low coupling, high cohesion&quot; sort of way where code is packaged into understandable, self-contained clumps that does an understandable &quot;thing&quot;. That way I don&#x27;t have to understand everything all at once, instead I can get an overview at the high-level and dive into the details when relevant to the work that needs doing.
We all chop our code into understandable abstractions already: We write functions and classes into separate files and folders. But as our project grows so does the need to keep organizing our code&#x27;s abstractions, and ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>I recently completed an online course and these are my takeaway from Composition and Inheritance.
With inheritance we can extend the functionality of an existing class by overriding its method in a Child class e.g
class Parent {
  function sayHi() {
    console.log(&quot;sayHi from Parent&quot;);
  }
}
class Child {
  function sayHi() {
    console.log(&quot;sayHi from the Child&quot;);
  }
}

Inheritance is characterised by an &quot;is-a&quot; relationship between two classes e.g Apple is Fruit, Car is a Vehicle etc. Inheritance is suited for use cases where there is tight coupling between the classes which is rarely the case in the real world.
Lets say your are building a house and you need to model a window in code. So you might come up with following:

Sometimes we create promises that take too long to finish and we don&#x27;t want to wait. For example, if we want to make a request and the response takes 20 seconds to finish and for any reason we may want to throw an error in the first 5 seconds and proceed to the next code block.
In this article, we will see how to implement a promise which throws an error after a specific time span. It supports typings with the power of Typescript and accepts a custom error to be thrown when the time comes.
First of all, we create a new promise that rejects an error after a time span in milliseconds. The return type of the timeout promise is never which represents the type of values that never occur. For instance, never is the return type for a function expression or‚Ä¶</span>

But yet, sometimes, these experiences are interrupted by moments of frustration. For example, maybe the library you have just pulled from npm does not expose type declarations? Or perhaps TypeScript is not aware of a global variable you know exists?
If that describes your experiences, read on. The following contains tips regarding extending TypeScript type declarations. I believe that by following them, the number of frustrations you experience while working with TypeScript will drastically decrease.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been very much avoiding using Typescript for quite a while, not because I don&#x27;t believe in statically typed software, I spent a decade in production Java and was a certified PERL developer. I just never found a reason to use it, being a content creator and Jamstack developer for the past 3 years I have just been using JavaScript without much issue. If I ended up working on a project with typescript I just understood the system coded and moved on. 
When I started writing Collabstream, I wrote an early implementation in JavaScript that used about 30 components, and a half dozen hooks with a bunch of API calls that required specific types. I was trying to pass props and data around and at least 30% of the time I was struggling to keep what variable type was supposed to where. I managed to finish the early POC but probably added hours of development time for no reason. I decided the POC worked really well but the code was an absolute mess, it was probably the worst &quot;production&quot; code I&#x27;ve written. I am okay with this, POC&#x27;s sometimes need to be dirty to see if what you originally came up with works and can scale.  One of the two was true, it worked but the scaling in it&#x27;s current form would make any dev team run off and live in a hut in the woods with no electricity. 
This is a simple answer, no. It has a time and a place, and I evaluate it on a case by case basis with a few simple questions:
Am I making a tutorial? 
Does this need scale?
Is this a node package?
I will never make a tutorial in TypeScript unless is a specific tutorial on Typescript as it makes the barrier to entry higher. If it&#x27;s a node package, it makes sense to be in TypeScript as it provides auto completion of what I am expecting. 
If you are thinking of learning TypeScript here are a few resources:

*ngIf and *ngFor will remove elements from the DOM. There isn‚Äôt a CSS solution for animating a non-existing element in the DOM. But Angular provides us with a simple solution.
For purposes of brevity, wherever I refer to *ngIf it is equally applicable to *ngFor. The complete, working code can be downloaded here.
Let‚Äôs start with the default application generated by the CLI and just modify the nice Angular logo in and out of the view based on a button we add.
ng new ngifAnimation

You won‚Äôt need routing and can select SCSS for the styling.
Let‚Äôs add the button we want to use to toggle our *ngIf on the image. Open app.component.html and add a simple button: (this is the default HTML)

Set up a project using Ionic 4 and Angular;
Integrate Google Maps into the project;
Exercise some Maps features like centering, maps inputs and outputs;
The basic dependencies to start your project are: Node.js and Angular. If you do not have Node.js, go here. If you do not have Angular installed, go here. After installing both, you need to install Ionic. Just type:
npm install -g @ionic/cli

  How do reverse shells work?


To make a connection to a typical remote shell, a machine controlled by the attacker connects to the remote network host and it requests a shell connection.
blind shell
But what if the remote host is not directly accessible, like it has public IP or is protected by a firewall?
In this situation reverse shells maybe shouldn&#x27;t be used, where the target machine initiates connection to the listening network host a shell is now established.
To start you need a listener process on their system to listen the reverse shell connections incoming to their IP address, Eg, 12.12.12.12
nc -lvnp 7070

The netcat listener will listen at port 7070. An attacker needs to execute the code to the listener. Many reverse shells needs programming langs

Python has a great feature where it first compiles your source code into bytecode; this is a low-level platform-independent representation of your source code.

In fact, Ermetic and IDC report that 80% of CISOs claim their company has had a cloud data breach in the past 18 months. Nearly half of those (43%) had experienced 10 or more breaches.
The benefits of cloud computing are numerous, but organizations cannot make the switch to this modern platform without understanding the risks involved and, more importantly, how to protect themselves, their staff and their customers.

                    <span>What is an Azure DevOps Personal Access Token (PAT)?


A personal access token (PAT) is used as an alternative to using a password to authenticate into Azure DevOps. When you&#x27;re working with third-party tools, APIs or the command line that don&#x27;t support Microsoft or Azure AD accounts or you don&#x27;t want to provide your primary credentials to the tool, you can make use of PATs.
PATs are easy to create when you need them and easy to revoke when you don‚Äôt.

When creating a new PAT you can select the organization where you want to use the token, and then choose a lifespan for your token. Say for example making it only active and usable for a period of 30 days. A PATs lifetime can be extended if needed, but cannot be longer than the maximum period of 1 year.

The average person has to keep track of approximately 100 passwords and spends almost 13 minutes every week resetting those passwords. Due to this friction, password reuse is a major issue with over two-thirds of end users reusing passwords across sites, creating widespread security vulnerabilities. The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) found that credential vulnerabilities are involved in more than 80% of all data breaches. Since password reuse is so common, a single compromised password can endanger multiple accounts. 
Auth0 was the first IAM system to build support for passwordless authentication, and all of these reasons are as pertinent as ever:
Passwords are insecure: users pick insecure passwords and reuse them across sites. Since data breaches are common and they frequently include password information, this creates a situation where more and more sites are vulnerable to hacking attempts.
Passwords are expensive to manage: users forget them, and resetting passwords can be an expensive and time-consuming process.
Passwords negatively impact customer retention: remembering and typing a password, particularly on a phone keyboard, carries friction, and can cause returning customers to abandon the login flow, therefore impacting retention.
We believe that moving away from passwords as an authentication method is key to making the internet safer while reducing friction and positively impacting user acquisition and retention. 
Since our initial release, the authentication industry has been hard at work finding better ways to implement passwordless authentication. For example, the FIDO Alliance successfully led the specification and implementation of WebAuthn. In the last few years, Webauthn has been implemented in all major OS/browsers, with iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 being the latest to join the party in September 2020.

Garis Besar Shurikenjutsu
Shurikenjutsu adalah pertarungan tangan kosong lempar shuriken dari Jepang. Seperti yang mungkin Anda ketahui, shuriken adalah senjata genggam kecil yang biasanya memiliki banyak sisi tajam (namun beberapa komponen memiliki satu sisi tajam). Itu digunakan di Jepang primitif sebagai senjata lempar dan juga senjata melukai.
Semua hal dipertimbangkan, peran dasar shuriken bukanlah untuk melukai atau melempar. Semua hal dipertimbangkan, itu digunakan untuk interupsi. Melempar shuriken dapat mengalihkan musuh juara samurai, m‚Ä¶</span>

Basics of Docker
Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution for modern applications and services. Keycloak provides both SAML and OpenID protocol solutions.
Keycloak provides identity and access management, it is also open source. It has several deep features integrated which helps in building easier production grade application by including Keycloak for Authentication and Authorization.
First we need to install Keycloak using docker so fire up the terminal/command prompt and type in the following command

Debes tener instalado AutoHotKey y crear un archivo llamado js-remapkeys.ahk con este script.
#NoEnv ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
; #Warn  ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.
SendMode Input ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir% ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.

                    <span>The Angular‚Äôs Core contains most of the functionalities you might need in your application, while with React and Vue, you have to find external libraries, maintained by independent contributors. Therefore, when working with React and Vue, you have to be more careful when choosing libraries, being aware that libraries with a poor maintenance might be deprecated in future.
To build an app with Angular you have to learn Typescript, which is a superset of JavaScript, while with Vue and React you can use pure JS. Regarding the view, with Angular and Vue you write it with HTML, where in React you have to write JSX, which is a syntax that allows coexistence between HTML and JS. Thus, Angular and Vue are ideal if you want to reuse HTML from a huge codebase.
Vue and React use a Virtual DOM (VDOM), which is a node tree listing content, and elements and their attribute as objects and properties. The browser DOM is not updated directly but instead, they use the VDOM as abstraction layer. On the other hand, Angular is based on the MVC pattern and manipulates the DOM directly. Changes in your application will update it without any middleware.
As common, when creating our apps, the components will have their scoped state, and Angular, and Vue works in a way that the data is mutable. User inputs and code can modify the state directly. In React, the state is immutable. To update it, you have to use a specific function that will do it asynchronously.
Angular and React have a powerful community behind. Angular was created by Google, and React by Facebook. Therefore, both have longer life expectancy. Whereas Vue, is an open source project, created by Evan You. Nevertheless, Vue gained a huge fame, because the creator‚Äôs idea was to take the best of the other two. From Angular, it took similar templates with good syntax, and from React, it got many features, specially the component-based approach. Vue is actively maintained, with almost 300 contributors and supported by many big companies.</span>

A few quick words on my &quot;less than optimal&quot; hardware: I basically had to make do with a small laptop that has definitely seen better days (days that have long since passed, I should probably add) with a freshly installed Ubuntu 20. But I could, of course, connect to my PC at the office over company VPN, as I&#x27;m sure is the case for many of you as well.

                    <span>This guide will show you how to recover lost data from a NAS storage system, with the example of D-link DSN-1100. Also, it will help you to retrieve information from the hard disks of an inoperable SAN device.

It is common knowledge that NAS is a server-type storage system designed to store various information at the file level. In fact, this is a computer with an array of disks inside, which is connected to a network. Every authorized user can interact with any files stored in a NAS. Such storage systems are becoming more and more popular because most of them make use of the RAID technology: It provides a serious boost in fault tolerance and increases security of storing large amounts of data. However, there is no system to give you a 100% guarantee against data loss. Sometimes, users ha‚Ä¶</span>

Also, programs start stacking up. You would need so many different programs like PHP, Python, MySQL, maybe nodeJS, which get jumbled on your computer.
Vagrant provides a separate OS box, a Virtual Machine loaded with PHP, Python-related development environments. It helps keep your OS free and clean.
Vagrant gets rid of the many development and production environments. Usually, we develop on Mac and need to deploy on a Linux server. Vagrant helps keep the process quick and easy to deploy after coding.
WAMP, MAMP are still much easier to install and needs just a one-click setup. However, vagrant setup without advanced stuff like chef or puppet can be simple.

I&#x27;m going to start with something very simple but could be doubs about this. 
The question is:  What happens when we use &lt;form #f&#x3D;&quot;ngForm&quot; ... ?
Someone could think that we&#x27;re referencing our form, this could be true, but in reality more things are happening behind the scenes.
The truth about this is that when we import FormsModule automatically NgForm is avalilable in our view, this means that NgForm is automatically‚Ä¶</span>

In Angular we get in build support for the routes we define to have implementation for canDeactivate guard which is how we can restrict the user from moving away from the view when some work is in progress on the current view. Example User is making an edit on his profile page and didn&#x27;t click on the save button so at that time if we have implemented the router guard for canDeactivate, the user will be asked for the confirmation.

# sudo apt install curl git
$ git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.8.1

Abra o arquivo ~/.bashrc e adicione as seguintes linhas:
#
# asdf - language/tools version manager
#
source ~/.asdf/asdf.sh
source ~/.asdf/completions/asdf.bash

Execute:
$ . .bashrc
Pronto, basta testar:
$ asdf info
Para instalar a linguagem Go por exemplo, basta:
$ asdf install golang 1.16.5
$ asdf global golang 1.16.5
$ asdf shell golang 1.16.5
