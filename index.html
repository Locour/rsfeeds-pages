First we have to create admin module:
ng g m admin --routing
--routing generates our routing module for admin automatically. 
with the help of router module we can pass our admin components. Which will only access by our admin.
ng g c admin/login
And  for showing admin list we have to create one more component 
ng g c admin/list
**Then we have to define our login component and list component inside our admin-routing.module.ts file.
import { ListComponent } from &#x27;./list/list.component&#x27;;

   import { LoginComponent } from &#x27;./login/login.component&#x27;;
const routes: Routes &#x3D; [



After that go to the app.module.ts file and define admin module inside that. 
import { AdminModule } from &#x27;./admin/admin.module&#x27;;



Then, we need to call our login and list component inside our parent component or app.component.html file. 
 


  

And lastly we need for run our project by serving. 
ng serve

                    <span>Top Angular 12 Features That You Should Know| Angular Development 
Angular 12 comes with a slew of performance, language service, compiler, form validation, and other enhancements. One of the primary upgrades contemplated in version 12 is the deprecation of the View engine and the adoption of the Ivy ecosystem.
In addition, Angular 12 offers improved style, Nullish Coalescing, and a move away from Legacy i18n Message-IDs, among other essential improvements that make this version reliable. Angular 12 also includes several bug updates for the compiler, core, router, language service, and other components.

                    <span>The Situation


Reactive Forms in Angular are incredibly powerful and let developers design experiences that provide immediate feedback to users. In this post I show how to use RxJS in a reactive form to provide useful UI feedback for a common use case: creating a password strength component to show password indicators to users creating passwords.
First, I decided to create distinct check box form controls for each password requirement and strength indicator. This lets me update the control for each indicator independently. I set the controls to disabled, so that the values can only be triggered programmatically, rather than directly by the user. The requirement indicator values start as false since none of them should be checked at first. I like to set this up in the parent component wher…</span>

                    <span>Building a great web app development is critical for retaining happy users. But with continuous influx of bugs to fix and new features to build, it becomes easier. There are some important steps that you can take to improve your angular App’s performance substantially. Few months before, a web.dev conference discussed “How to stay fast and fresh with Angular”. The discussion was about the measures to improve angular app performance and bundle size.  The suggestions from this discussion were applied through the lens of an ionic app, Ionifits. Ionifits is a Zenefits-inspired human resource demo app showcasing various Ionic app platform technologies like Ionic Framework, Ionic Native Enterprise solutions and Capacitor. These are ready to be tested in your web, iOS or android devices. 
1. Divide App Into Modules For Native Angular Lazy Loading-
$ ionic generate page about/about
2. Keep Angular up-to-date Regularly With “ng update” –
$ ng update @angular/cli @angular/core
Reference the package. json files in the Ionic starter template apps to ensure whether dependencies will work together. The template apps are updated and support latest compatible versions by Ionic framework and DevRel teams.
3. Configure Size Budgets-

                    <span>Selecting data from an Ngrx store has always been achieved by using selectors. As Ngrx has developed over the last couple of years, selectors have become easier and easier to use.
interface Customer { id: number; name: string; }
interface AppState { customers: Customer[] }

export const selectCustomers &#x3D; (state: AppState) &#x3D;&gt; state.customers;

The above selectCustomers selector conveniently returns Customers from the store.
To do this is nice and simple in Ngrx 12+; we can use a factory selector.
import { createSelector } from &#x27;@ngrx/store&#x27;;

interface Customer { id: number; name: string; }
interface AppState { customers: Customer[] }

export const selectCustomers &#x3D; (state: AppState) &#x3D;&gt; state.customers;

// selector with param
export const selectCustomerById &#x3D; (customerId: number) &#x3D;&gt;
  createSelector(
    selectCustomers, 
    (customers: Customers[]) &#x3D;&gt; 
      customers.find(c &#x3D;&gt; c.id &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; customerId) 
  )

We can then get a customer with the id of 123 from the store; by passing a value for the customerId into our selector:
this.store.select(selectCustomerById(123));

Hope this helps you all out as the older method of using props is now deprecated in Ngrx 12+. (https://github.com/ngrx/platform/issues/2980)
I also have a YouTube channel called Coffee Music &amp; Coding which you may find useful for Angular and Ngrx tutorials.</span>

Using Blazor VSCode Extensions, you can build applications from start to finish using the C# programming language. Blazo VSCode Extensions facilitate code reusability and modularity because UI components are implemented using only C#, HTML, and CSS.
Client software using Blazor VSCode Extensions executes C# code directly in a browser using WebAssembly. This is possible because Blazor itself is a .NET application running on WebAssembly. It can also run client logic on servers as it uses SignalR. SignalR is a real-time messaging framework that ensures efficient communication with servers.

                    <span>Up until now you have been adding properties to the prototype individually:




Dog.prototype.numLegs &#x3D; 4;

This becomes tedious after more than a few properties.




Dog.prototype.eat &#x3D; function() {
  console.log(&quot;nom nom nom&quot;);
}

Dog.prototype.describe &#x3D; function() {
  console.log(&quot;My name is &quot; + this.name + &quot;.&quot;);
}

A more efficient way is to set the prototype to a new object that already contains the properties. This way, the properties are added all at once:




Dog.prototype &#x3D; {
  numLegs: 4,
  eat: function() {
    console.log(&quot;nom nom nom&quot;);
  },
  describe: function() {
    console.log(&quot;My name is &quot; + this.name + &quot;.&quot;)
  }
};

There is one crucial side effect of manually setting the prototype to a new object. It erases the constructor property! This property can be used to check which constructor function created the instance, but since the property has been overwritten, it now gives false results:
To fix this, whenever a prototype is manually set to a new object, remember to define the constructor property:




function Dog(name) {
  this.name &#x3D; name;
}

Dog.prototype &#x3D; {
  constructor: Dog, // &lt;----
  numLegs: 4,
  eat: function() {
    console.log(&quot;nom nom nom&quot;);
  },
  describe: function() {
    console.log(&quot;My name is &quot; + this.name);
  }
};</span>

                    <span>There is a special constructor property located on the object instance beagle that was created in the previous posts:




let beagle &#x3D; new Dog();

console.log(beagle.constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Dog);

This console.log calls would display true in the console.


Note that the constructor property is a reference to the constructor function that created the instance. The advantage of the constructor property is that it&#x27;s possible to check for this property to find out what kind of object it is. 


Here&#x27;s an example of how this could be used:




function joinDogFraternity(candidate) {
   if (candidate.constructor &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Dog) {
     return true;
   } else {
     return false;
   }
}

Here I just wrote a joinDogFraternity function that takes a candidate parameter and, using the constructor property, return true if the candidate is a Dog, otherwise return false.
Note: Since the constructor property can be overwritten (which will be covered in the next two posts) it’s generally better to use the instanceof method to check the type of an object.</span>

                    <span>You have now seen two kinds of properties: own properties and prototype properties. Own properties are defined directly on the object instance itself. And prototype properties are defined on the prototype.




function Dog(name) {
  this.name &#x3D; name; // own property
}

Dog.prototype.numLegs &#x3D; 4; // prototype property

let beagle &#x3D; new Dog(&quot;Snoopy&quot;); 

Here is how you add dog&#x27;s own properties to the array ownProps and prototype properties to the array prototypeProps:




let ownProps &#x3D; [];
let prototypeProps &#x3D; [];

for (let properties in beagle) {
  if (beagle.hasOwnProperty(properties)) {
    ownProps.push(properties);

Since numLegs will probably have the same value for all instances of Dog, you essentially have a duplicated variable numLegs inside each Dog instance.
This may not be an issue when there are only two instances, but imagine if there are millions of instances. That would be a lot of duplicated variables.
A better way is to use Dog’s prototype. Properties in the prototype are shared among ALL instances of Dog. Here&#x27;s how to add numLegs to the Dog prototype:




Dog.prototype.numLegs &#x3D; 4;

function Dog(name) {
  this.name &#x3D; name;
}

Dog.prototype.numLegs &#x3D; 4;

let beagle &#x3D; new Dog(&quot;Snoopy&quot;);
let husky &#x3D; new Dog(&quot;Rex&quot;;

* Now all instances of &#x60;Dog&#x60; have the &#x60;numLegs&#x60; property.

console.log(beagle.numLegs); // will display 4
console.log(husky.numLegs); // will display 4

Since all instances automatically have the properties on the prototype, think of a prototype as a &quot;recipe&quot; for creating objects. Note that the prototype for beagle and husky is part of the Dog constructor as Dog.prototype. Nearly every object in JavaScript has a prototype property which is part of the constructor function that created it.</span>

In the following example, the Dog constructor defines two properties: name and numLegs:




function Dog(name) {
  this.name  &#x3D; name;
  this.numLegs &#x3D; 4;
}

let greyHound &#x3D; new Dog(&quot;Sakura&quot;);
let bullDog &#x3D; new Dog(&quot;Tanjiro&quot;);

name and numLegs are called own properties, because they are defined directly on the instance object. That means that greyHound and bullDog each has its own separate copy of these properties. In fact every instance of Dog will have its own copy of these properties. The following code adds all of the own properties of greyHound to the array ownProps:




function Dog(name) {
  this.name  &#x3D; name;
  this.numLegs &#x3D; 4;
}

let greyHound &#x3D; new Dog(&quot;Sakura&quot;);
let ownProps &#x3D; [];

for (let properties in greyHound) {
  if (greyHound.hasOwnProperty(properties)) {
    ownProps.push(properties);
  }
}

console.log(ownProps); // the console would display the value [&#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;numLegs&#x27;]</span>

Anytime a constructor function creates a new object, that object is said to be an instance of its constructor. JavaScript gives a convenient way to verify this with the instanceof operator. instanceof allows you to compare an object to a constructor, returning true or false based on whether or not that object was created with the constructor. 


Here&#x27;s an example:




function Dog(name, color) {
  this.name &#x3D; name;
  this.color &#x3D; color;
  this.numLegs &#x3D; 4;
}

let goldenRetriever &#x3D; new Dog(&quot;Naruto&quot;, orange);

goldenRetriever instanceof House; // will display true

This instanceof method would return true.
If an object is created without using a constructor, instanceof will verify that it is not an instance of that constructor:</span>

                    <span>If you need to run Kubernetes, today very frequently you just pick one managed in some cloud provider. However this option is frequently expensive. A cheaper option is to get a bunch of virtual machines and install Kubernetes in it.
Creating a Kubernetes cluster actually today is pretty simple, using tools like MicroK8s but there are still some manual actions to take.
To make cluster building even simpler, you can use for example cloud-init, the standard for cloud image initialization. So I decided to write a cloud-init that can automatically build a cluster for you.
The result is here, you can download it with this command:
curl -sL bit.ly/microk8s-init &gt;microk8s-init.yaml

To entirely automate the cluster generation I had to use a couple of tricks.

                    <span>I&#x27;m usually making quite a bit of noise trying to promote the &quot;original&quot; idea of DevOps. That is, the unifying practice of tackling development and operations together as part of delivering a software product.
Many (particularly in the world of recruitment) use DevOps as a synonym for Ops when referring to a role. This is not the intention of the concept, though that&#x27;s a point I&#x27;ve talked about in other articles.
This article is about the first step towards DevOps (or at least what I consider a first step to be). Of course, DevOps doesn&#x27;t mean one person needs to have complete master over both areas but there has to be some crossover so that people know what the person next to them is talking about.
There&#x27;s a simple way to make a step towards that understanding: know your tools. Specifical…</span>

Created by Jordan Walke, a Facebook Software engineer, the first version of React came out seven years ago. Now, Facebook maintains it. Since its initial release, React’s popularity has skyrocketed.
In October 2020, React 17 was announced with — surprisingly — zero new features. However, this certainly doesn’t mean nothing exciting was added. In fact, this release comes with many promising upgrades, including several improvements and bug fixes to version 16’s experimental features: Concurrent Mode and Suspense.

                    <span>I have been meaning to write about this for a while. Since most of my work revolves around building API&#x27;s and deploying them, it is pretty important for me (and people like me) to automate as many things as possible in order to get the best out of my time and available resources.
My current tech stack revolves around the following:
Python (that wasn&#x27;t hard to guess, huhh!?)
FastAPI (For the API)
Celery (For workers to do tasks in the background)
Docker (Why not!?)
GitHub (Version control)
DigitalOcean (Server)
I will try to keep things as simple as possible.
I use Python as my primary language to build API&#x27;s. FastAPI is a Python framework that makes building production API&#x27;s way simpler. Celery is a Python tool/library that queues tasks and does them in the background.

                    <span>I decided to give my laptop a virtual makeover recently. One thing that stuck out was the terminal. 
A terminal is a dark rectangle with text. It&#x27;s utilitarian. There isn&#x27;t a lot of options for making it stylish, but you can make it feel more personal with a few changes.
The 3 major things you can do is: 
Change the colour scheme: I made my own colour scheme. If you are searching, this repo is a great source for colour schemes for many different terminal apps.
Pick a font: I installed a nerd font. Nerd fonts add icons to popular monospace fonts. These icons can be used in your text prompt and are used by some command-line applications to give more of a modern UI-feel. JetBrainsMono Nerd Font is my favourite.
Modify the prompt text: You can configure the text yourself, or try a prompt theme…</span>

                    <span>Since the initial release of React in 2013, Facebook has rolled out a robust collection of tools to help developers with some of the minutiae of the web application development process, allowing them to focus on what matters most.
Despite React’s many capabilities and widespread adoption among developers, I’ve discovered that many of us face the same question: How can we handle complicated states with React? 
This post will look at what state is, how to arrange it, and alternative patterns to use as our applications become more complicated.
React may be thought of as a blueprint in its most basic form. Your application will appear in a specific way depending on the status. React prefers declarative over imperative programming, a fancy way of stating that you express what you want to happen rather than the processes to get there. As a result, appropriately managing the state becomes critical, as the state determines how your program will act.

                    <span>So, you have a frontend app, written in a SPA framework like Angular, React, Vue or maybe Svelte? And you want to find the quickest way to get it to the Cloud? There are many ways to do so, GitHub, Azure Storage, but there&#x27;s also Azure Static Web Apps service. 
So, there are a few moving parts that you may or may not use, like the below
Frontend, this is your app written in a framework like Angular, React.js, Vue.js etc


API, this is your backend that you build using Azure functions, so it&#x27;s Serverless which is great on your wallet but also for architecting with events in the Cloud


Auth, auth is always a bit cumbersome but great once it&#x27;s up and running.

                    <span>As newer version of NodeJS is released, it brings with it - performance improvements, speed, security, new features and more. If you have a nodejs based web application and plan to upgrade the version of nodejs, then of course it becomes important to test the application on the new version to ensure its sanity.
In this post we will explore how can use Docker to run our nodejs based application with two (or more) versions of nodejs.
Lets explore the directory structure to understand how the files have been organized.
vishalr@ubuntu ~&gt; tree multi-node-app
multi-node-app/
├── app
│   ├── index.js
│   └── package.json
├── docker-compose.yml
├── node14.Dockerfile
├── node16.Dockerfile
└── proxy
    └── nginx.conf

2 directories, 6 files
vishalr@ubuntu ~&gt; 

The main app resides inside the app folder. The files node14.Dockerfile and node16.Dockerfile contain instructions to build docker image, to run app with Node v14.x and v16.x. The file docker-compose.yml is a wrapper over the two docker files and adds Nginx as proxy over two docker containers. The file proxy/nginx.conf contains the barebones configuration to use nginx as proxy for our application.
Additionally we also need to make the following entry in the file /etc/hosts.
127.0.0.1  node16.myapp.local  node14.myapp.local

To start all the containers execute the following command -
vishalr@ubuntu ~&gt; docker-compose up

Once all the containers (nginx, node16 and node14) are up, you can use the urls http://node16.myapp.local and http://node14.myapp.local in your local browser to test your application running with Node v16.x and Node v14.x respectively.

Then came promises which made our life much easy and code started looking much better, and much easy to maintain.
Then came async/await which made it even better.
In this post, let&#x27;s see how to use top level async await.
But first, let us see how does it look now.

Welcome to Plasma Donation Website. As we all know, the world is suffering from the COVID-19 crisis. Our government and health care professionals are trying their best to help the patients suffering from COVID-19. Scientists are trying to discover a vaccine to cure people affected with coronavirus. There is a scientific way from which we can help to lower the death ratio or help the COVID 19 affected person. Plasma therapy is an experimental approach to treat COVID-positive patients and help them recover faster. But, in this situation, it is difficult for a patient to find a plasma donor as everybody can’t donate plasma.

                    <span>Hi there.
At first, let&#x27;s talk about what is node.js.
These are just a few companies that use Node.js. There are many more, for the same or different reasons.
Uber, a cab dispatch service, also uses Node.js for their core system. 
Node.js was chosen because the Uber service is used all over the world and requires a huge network system to operate.
Paypal is a payment service that uses email accounts and the Internet.
By switching from Java to Node.js as the server-side development language, the gap with the front-side development has been reduced.
LinkedIn is the social network for professional connections. It is best suited for people looking to make serious career moves who want to get noticed by relevant companies. 
Previously, Ruby on Rails was used, but in order to increase the speed of access, it was moved to Node.js.
Netflix is the world’s biggest global provider of video streaming including movies and television series, available in over 190 countries. As of July 2020, Netflix reported over 192 million subscribers worldwide, with more than 72 million in the U.S itself.
Previously, Netflix was using Java on the back end and JavaScript on the front end, which required the developers to be proficient with languages.
Now, The user interface (UI) of Netflix was built using Node.js.
Next, his is an explanation of the Node.js package management tool &quot;npm&quot;.
npm is automatically installed when Node.js is installed.
There are two ways to install packages with npm &quot;global installation&quot; and &quot;local installation&quot;.
npm allows to create a file called &quot;package.json&quot;.
These are useful command of npm.
npm install npm 
npm i npm 

npm install [package name] 
npm i [package name] 

npm uninstall [package name] 
npm rm [package name] 

npm update [package name] 
npm up [package name] 

npm list 
npm ls 

npm init

Today, I explained about basic Node.js.
I hope this article helps you understand node.js!
Happy coding! :)</span>

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.</span>

Pensando en la calidad de un sitio web, generalmente nos concentramos en rendimiento, SEO y accesibilidad. Sin embargo, la capacidad del sitio web de estar preparado ante ataques maliciosos no es la ideal, Importante! ya que backend y frontend son responsables de la seguridad de los datos que comparten.



PROTÉGETE EN CONTRA DE XSS

En primer lugar es importante tener en cuenta que con esta vulnerabilidad, los atacantes explotan la confianza que un usuario tiene en un sitio en particular, y esto nos da una dimensión del impacto que puede tener.
Este tipo de vulnerabilidad puede ser explotada de dos maneras: de forma reflejada y de forma almacenada.

Generate private cert for all accounts so that all internal applications can use this cert.
Analysis
TLDR
a. Choose an account to centralize one Root CA and another account for one Subordinate CA, use only ACM generated certificate to be eligible for managed renewal.
b. Give other accounts permission to request Private Certificates, to export it, and then to import it to ACM or Secrets Manager in its own account. For on-premise, after issuing Private Certificate, export it and then store in on-premise Vault.
c. Renew by repeating step (2) after the certificates are renewed in the central account.
d. With this arrangement, cost will be 2 x $400 plus $0.75 per Private Certificate stored in ACM which will be less than if you were to host ACM PCA in every accounts.

Yara is nice, mostly because is the common query in most public resources of discovered malware. Although, I wondered about the limits of the rules, and how to look for regex conditionals as I would do in other TTP (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures) queries. Also I wondered if it might be more convenient for a light environment such as my manjaro RPI for malware analysis. SO anyway let&#x27;s explore about Raku possibilities for this topic. First of all, Raku was created by some Perl enthusiasts, one of them (the one who also taught me about it) has a blog here too.

                    <span>In a past article, I wrote about JWTs, how to generate one and how to use them for authorization. JSON Web Tokens, however, have one major drawback. Once it is generated and submitted to the client, it can’t be easily made invalid. This is a big problem if the JWT got leaked and it did not expire (or worse, it does NOT have an expiration date). That is why it is important to make sure that your JWT can be invalidated at the server-side and I will show you two methods to do this.
The easiest way, at least at first glance, is to have a way of blacklisting a JWT once it is compromised. You can store all compromised JWTs in the database and when an authorization request is received, you check that the JWT used is not part of this list. This approach has one big disadvantage though: the DB can …</span>

                    <span>JavaScript functions that return React elements are known as React components. These are the parameters that govern what will be added to the DOM. In addition, react components, like functions, may receive props as arguments, resulting in dynamically returned items.
Props can be of any data type, although component data types may differ. Component A, for example, may anticipate a name argument with a text data type, but component B may anticipate an age argument with a numeric data type. Likewise, D may anticipate an onClick argument with a Function data type, but C may expect a post parameter with an object data type with characteristics like title and date.
How can we tell our component what kind of data it should expect?
This may be done in various methods, but this post will focus on PropTypes and TypeScript. Despite holding identical goals, these two techniques operate in different ways. So we’ll go through what these tools are, how to use them, and tell them apart before trying more advanced techniques.
Prior knowledge of PropTypes and TypeScript is necessary for a thorough understanding of this article. You’ll also require an integrated development environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code.
PropTypes is a type-checking tool for props in React apps that can be used at runtime. The PropTypes efficiency has been provided through the prop-types package since React 15.5. PropTypes let you specify the props that are expected in a component, such as whether they are mandatory or optional. You’ll get a warning in the browser’s JavaScript console if you provide a different type to an element or miss a required prop:

Typescript, Tailwind support because css is boring.
git clone https://github.com/100lvlmaster/nextjs-tailwind-typescript-starter.git

This will give all the required tools already setup. So that we can get the app up and runnig in no time

                    <span>Sometimes in TypeORM you want to save location/coordinates in a type that can take advantage of GIS functions like distance, closeness etc MySQL and Postgres have these functions that get this information when you have geometry data column types.
This was surprisingly difficult to find information on so here&#x27;s my implementation.
I assume you already have a TypeORM project set up.
Install these packages:
npm install wkx geojson 
npm install @types/geojson --save-dev

Then add this custom transformer that converts GeoJSON to WKT and WKT back to GeoJSON
Example GeoJSON:
const location &#x3D; {
   type: &#x27;point&#x27;,
   coordinates: [-74.534, 39.123]
}

Example WKT (like you would use in MySQL query):
POINT(-74.534, 39.123)

This would be saved as BLOB type in MySQL
First you need to add the transformer…</span>

                    <span>You can play along in typescript playground
Built in Pick, Omit and other similar type operators don&#x27;t quite support union types well.
One of the main issues is in keyof. By default when keyof is used with union type it will common keys. this is usually not what you want, for example:
type X &#x3D; 
  | { type: &quot;string&quot;, foo: string, komara: 1 }
  | { type: &quot;number&quot;, foo: number, kzxzdad: string }
  | { type: &quot;undefined&quot;, foo: undefined, ajjs: 1, asdad: 44 }

type Keys &#x3D; keyof T

// type Keys_X &#x3D; &quot;type&quot; | &quot;foo&quot;
type Keys_X &#x3D; Keys

To fix this we want to use distributive conditional types:
type DistributiveKeys &#x3D; T extends unknown ? Keys : never;

// type DistributiveKeys_X &#x3D; &quot;type&quot; | &quot;foo&quot; | &quot;komara&quot; | &quot;kzxzdad&quot; | &quot;ajjs&quot; | &quot;asdad&quot;

                    <span>React component development is kinda fun. What&#x27;s even...uhhh...funner? Driving your component development from inside a test.
No, I&#x27;m serious.
As we saw in the previous article introducing this, React+TDD isn&#x27;t just about &quot;quality&quot; (scare quotes) and eating your vegetables. Particularly when paired with TypeScript and smart tooling, it&#x27;s a pleasurable mode of development -- faster, joyful, puppies.
Let&#x27;s get more specific in this article by going through some of the modes of component development. As a reminder, this article follows a full video+text+code tutorial in the WebStorm Guide.
Using React and TypeScript means good JSX (TSX) and ES6+ support, especially in smart editors. We can see this in action from the tutorial step on this subject.

Express.js
Express.js happens to be amongst the leading web app frameworks of Node.js. It is extremely flexible and lightweight that provides powerful features for mobile and web app development. This framework offers a layer of basic web app features without complicating the features of Node.js. You will come across lots of well-known frameworks based on Express.js.

While building my newest SaaS product, ReduxPlate, I realized a common pattern kept cropping up in my array manipulation functions. I was always updating a specific value at a specific key, based on a specific test on some other key.
*Plug: Speaking of ReduxPlate, which automatically generates Redux code for you, I&#x27;m writing a book that documents every step I took along the way to build ReduxPlate, from boilerplate starters to the finished live product. I&#x27;d love it if you check it out! Yes, You&#x27;ve read this correctly! I literally build ReduxPlate from start to finish, right before your eyes - and the code is all public!
For example, for the editor widget on the ReduxPlate homepage, I use a stateful array of type IEditorSettings to determine which editor is…</span>

👨‍💻 I was in a search for an all-in-one article to help me get started with Babel without ever reading the whole documentation but I didn&#x27;t found any So, after deeply going through the Babel docs I&#x27;m writing this.
I assure you to move you from zero to a little less than advanced in babel but don&#x27;t worry I&#x27;ll also tell you important things to become advance in it.
So, if you&#x27;ve heard about babel but never got into knowing what, why, and how about it, you should continue reading this.

The left one is the user and the right one is the browser.
JavaScript has evolved a lot in the previous years and the all latest features of JavaScript are not supported in many modern browsers but most of them are.

                    <span>In this article, we are going to learn how to create functions which are easy to test and mock using TypeScript utility types.
Let&#x27;s take the following function, how do you mock it&#x27;s inputs i.e. person:
interface Person {
    name: {
        firstName: string;
        lastName: string;
    }
    id: string;
    age: number;
    height: number;
    weight: number;
}

function getPersonsFullName(person: Person) {
    return &#x60;${person.name.firstName} ${person.name.lastName}&#x60;;
}

One common way, is to create an object of type Person with only the fields being used by function and then cast the object as any, as shown below:
const person &#x3D; {
    name: {
        firstName: &quot;Wycliffe&quot;,
        lastName: &quot;Maina&quot;
    }
}

console.log(getPersonsFullName(person as any));

This works, but you are losi…</span>

Apps are the direct means through which they can interact with their customers, market their products and provide their customers an easy way to manage their services with them. And, did we forget to mention that they give your business a competitive edge as well?
When it comes to web application development, there are a number of frameworks available in the market. One of such popular frameworks is – AngularJS, an open-source JavaScript MVC framework. MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. The AngularJS framework has been built and managed by Google.
The framework was developed to build the client-side applications. Since then, the framework has evolved to become a well defined and sought after JavaScript framework.

If this sounds exciting to u, please stay with me as I walk you through this simple little process. If you get in trouble you can check the files in my GitHub repo linked here.
In order to follow this demo u must have Docker installed on your machine. I&#x27;m using Docker Desktop for Windows (you could download here). I&#x27;ll recommend u to use Linux containers and set Docker to use WSL - v2 for its engine instead of Hyper-V.

To test the correctness of the demo u should have installed a client that could connect to SQL Server (I use SQL Server Management Studio).

                    <span>Introduction


I have demonstrated some data manipulations with ORM(Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks such as TypeORM so far. Today&#x27;s topic is still cases with TypeORM. However, it focuses on the security, which is my main field at the moment. I think you understand why I select topics regarding complex queries, performance, and the difference from the Microsoft ecosystem.
I developed a demo application in GitHub.
Demo Application for SQL injection tutorials
Some experienced developers mention that ORM(Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks such as TypeORM support prevent SQL injection, which is a traditional security matter. However, I still find high-risk cases with ORM frameworks in GitHub repositories, public project spaces, or in my work experience.
This is a typical high-risk case…</span>

For this article I’m going to assume you already understand the basics of Angular routing and components. I won’t bore you with building an entire application. We’ll get right to adding animations so you can see immediate results!
The finished code for this example can be found here.
In your app.module.ts add BrowserAnimationsModule to the module imports.
...
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from &#x27;@angular/platform-browser/animations&#x27;;
@NgModule({
    imports: [
        ...,
        BrowserAnimationsModule
    ],
    ...
})
export class AppModule {}

For unit testing, import NoopAnimationsModule instead. This fulfills the contracts while isolating unit tests from having to deal with the transitions.

                    <span>Thanks to the Angular CLI and the Cypress Schematic, spinning up a new Angular 12 project with Cypress is incredibly easy.
Here&#x27;s how to do it in less than 2 minutes:
Install the Angular CLI if you haven&#x27;t and create a new project:




ng new angular-cypress-demo

Navigate to the newly created project directory and install the Cypress Angular Schematic via the CLI:




ng add @cypress/schematic

Once you&#x27;ve completed these steps, Cypress will be set up with a default config, and basic files and folders will be installed within your project in the cypress folder - including an initial test.

                    <span>This is the shopping.csv CSV file that we will be working with throughout this blog post.
item,price
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

The goal is to create a one-line bash script that prints the sum of the prices in the file above, which is 7.77.
Step: 1. Print the file content
$ cat shopping.csv

This command prints the file content without modifications.
Output:
item,price
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

Step: 2. Cut the first line
There are many ways to achieve it, but we use the tail +n syntax.
In our case, it takes all the lines until the end of the file, starting from the second line.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2

Output:
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

Step: 3. Cut the first column
awk splits each line by a separator defined by the option -F.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , &#x27;{print $2}&#x27;

Output:
2.49
1.49
3.79

Step: 4. Concatenate the prices
xargs is used to &quot;squash&quot; the lines into a single string, separating them by space.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , &#x27;{print $2}&#x27; | xargs

Output:
2.49 1.49 3.79

Step: 5. Replace spaces with pluses
The sed expression replaces the escaped space with + in the entire string (globally - g).
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , &#x27;{print $2}&#x27; | xargs | sed -e &#x27;s/\ /+/g&#x27;

Output:
2.49+1.49+3.79

Step: 6. Perform the calculation
bc is a simple calculator that you can use interactively or by piping an equation into it.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , &#x27;{print $2}&#x27; | xargs | sed -e &#x27;s/\ /+/g&#x27; | bc

Output:
7.77</span>

                    <span>Picking tools to take screenshots is rarely seen as a primary concern, but I believe it is a largely underrated topic. I do take a lot of them in my daily job: to document an issue, to show something to a member of my team, to illustrate a presentation, a blog article, and so on.
For a long time, I was just using the default software on Ubuntu but I was really frustrated, they were no way to annotate them to highlight a particular part. Moreover, I often felt the need to show things with an animated screenshot but just did not know how to do so.
For something I do several times a day, spending some time to find the best fitting tools to my needs was a good investment, and I could not work anymore without the two following programs.

This is the first post of a series that aims to explain how to get a fully productive and integrated Linux development environment within Windows 10. Today, I will explain what is WSL 2 and how to install it on Windows.
But first what it&#x27;s first. What is WSL 2? The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications such as bash, ssh, sudo, apt, curl, etc. -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or the extra disk space needed for a dual boot setup.
WSL 2 is a new version of the Windows Subsystem which primary goals are to increase file system performance, as well as adding full system call compatibility. The Linux kernel is executing in para…</span>

                    <span>Docker containers are assigned addresses from a network on each host (or from a mesh in the case of a Swarm cluster) when run in a standalone fashion, and in order to access them from outside the host, the following patterns are common:
docker run -d --name nginx -p 8080:80 nginx 

to expose the nginx app on http://HOST_IP:8080 , or less commonly, attaching directly to the host’s network:
docker run -d --net host --name nginx nginx

where no port forwarding rule is required, because it will bind ports as required to the host network.
In a production scenario, or even one where a host and its containers should have separate addresses, or not accessed through the host network, docker network can be used to attached to a bridge device, to allow Docker containers to get addresses from your ext…</span>

At some point you will probably need to store a user&#x27;s auth token on the device, so they won&#x27;t need to auth whenever they use your app. This is a solved problem on Android with EncryptedSharedPreferences and iOS with the Keychain Services API. But if you&#x27;re creating a mobile app using Kotlin Multiplatform, the KMP solution might not be as clear. Today we&#x27;ll go over how to store encrypted key-value data with KMP without having to reinvent the wheel.
Multiplatform Settings is a solid multiplatform key-value store, created by Touchlab&#x27;s own Russell Wolf, used extensively at Touchlab, as well as in Jetbrains&#x27; KMM Production Sample. There is a Settings interface that is implemented for Android, iOS, MacOS, and JVM platforms. At first glance, it doesn&#x27;t look like Multiplatform Settings o…</span>

There obviously is more of a complex process involved in setting up a social login but for a user its as simple as clicking a buttons to log in. The ease of not having to remember an ID/password and just being able to signup/login through the click of a button is extremely beneficial to the user
Social logins really help us achieve a few things:

It is essentially a place where you store Docker images organized in repositories. You can push images to the remote Docker registry and pull images where you want them.
Nifty service that Docker.com runs is Docker hub or a Docker Registry that has many things automated so you don&#x27;t have to bother with configuring it on your own server (which we will get to in a bit).

                    <span>I have an old HP 4050N. For a variety of reasons, I want to have it behind a print server instead of having our laptops print directly to it. Here&#x27;s how I set that up.
A Raspberry Pi (or honestly any Linux box) running docker. I like the Raspberry Pi and Odroid HC2 for this sort of thing because they have very low power consumption.
A printer that is supported by CUPS




  
  
  Setup


There are several docker images out there you can use, I made one (the source is on github at unixorn/docker-cupsd) because I wanted one that was multi-architecture - mine has AMD64, ARM7 and ARM64 all baked into the same image so you don&#x27;t have to change the image label based on what system you&#x27;re running it on. It works fine on Raspberry Pi, Odroids and Intel servers.
The unixorn/cupsd image is a bit on the large side because I crammed a lot of printer drivers into it, you may want to look for docker images that only support single printer families.
We&#x27;re going to store printers.conf in a directory outside the container so that we don&#x27;t lose our printer configuration every time we upgrade our container.
I run the cupsd server on an Odroid HC2 because I have /var/lib/docker on the 2TB drive attached to it. I could have put it on one of the Raspberry Pis in my cluster, but didn&#x27;t want it spooling print jobs and causing excessive wear on a rPi&#x27;s microSD card.
Make a directory to store your printer configuration. We&#x27;ll use /docker/cupsd/etc

export CUPSD_DIR&#x3D;&#x27;/docker/cupsd/etc&#x27;
touch $CUPSD_DIR/printers.conf
Run the cupsd server with




sudo docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 631:631 \
  --privileged \
  -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
  -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
  -v &quot;$CUPSD_DIR/printers.conf:/etc/cups/printers.conf&quot; \
  unixorn/cupsd

You can now connect to http://SERVER:631 and add printers using the web UI.
When adding the printers to your Mac, select Internet Printing Protocol and put in the IP or DNS name of your print server machine.
The queues are printers/printername, not printername.</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got an old HP laser printer in my basement. We barely print 10 pages a month between the two of us, so we only turn it on when we&#x27;re going to print. That&#x27;s a hassle though, because inevitably we forget to shut it off sometimes and it stays on overnight or even for days, and while it has a powersave mode, the 4050N is so old that even that burns a good amount of power.
Enter Home Assistant.
The watcher script and associated tooling all presume that we can send messages to a MQTT topic that HA is watching.
Your computers should be configured to print to the cupsd server instead of directly to the printer.
I run cupsd in a container on one of my Odroids. I could run it on the same Odroid HC2 that I run Home Assistant (HA) on, but there&#x27;s no compelling reason to do so and I&#x27;m reserving th…</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
