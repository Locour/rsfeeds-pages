                    <span>In this series of articles, I am sharing the lessons that I have learned from building reactive applications in Angular using NgRx state management. My introduction explained how I came to use NgRx. Going forward, I will share best practices in the form of an example application, Eternal. Here, we’ll look at the way state management lets you add caching functionality to your code.

This pattern ensures that the store does not load data it already has. In other words: It adds a caching functionality.
We create this pattern in two steps. The state gets an additional property called loadStatus, which it uses internally to determine if a request to …</span>

Forgetting to delete unused images.
Building a lot of images that left previous versions as untagged.
Creating networks but not deleting them.
Forgetting to delete old volumes.
keeping alive containers that are not needed anymore.
Forgetting to delete stopped containers.
And the worst can be trying to delete all those resources one by one using
docker rm 
docker rm

Specially if the amount of forgotten resources is high.
Another example can be found on running resources, if yo do not limit docker consumption, a container might take all the available memory assigned to docker and left oth…</span>

Companies like LinkedIn, Uber, and Slack have large teams of over 25 employees working just on notifications, but smaller companies like yours don’t have that luxury. So how can you meet the same level of quality with a team of one? This is the second post in our series on how you, a developer, can build or improve the best notification system for your company.

It is a very simple solution which requires almost zero coding. Yet, it&#x27;s quite powerful as it allows you to deploy automatically every time there is a change in your code. 
We will be using Github actions to achieve that. In particular, we will cover the following steps:
Build and deploy a new docker image to ECR
Retrieve and update the task definition with the new image tag
Update the corresponding services and force redeployment

                    <span>SLIs, or service level indicators, are powerful metrics of service health. They’re often built up from simpler metrics that are monitored from the system. SLIs transform lower level machine data into something that captures user happiness.
Your organization might already have processes with this same goal. Techniques like real-time telemetry and using synthetic data also build metrics that meaningfully represent service health. In this article, we’ll break down how these techniques vary, and the unique benefits of adopting SLIs.
Service level indicators, or SLIs, are metrics that represent your service’s health in specific areas. They can be simple metrics like percentile latency of request for a method, or complex metrics like a latency histogram of 3 different methods. Complexity aside, …</span>

The tech stack can greatly improve my development efficiency.
The tech stack does not require a lot of money.
The first point is that I would choose to use a more efficient tech stack, including programming language, ecology, architecture, etc.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a lot of talk lately about developer self service for Kubernetes. It looks like every vendor in the Kubernetes space now claims they offer some kind of developer self service.
Some might disagree, but the overall opinion is that Kubernetes is not really developer friendly. Kubernetes has over 50 object types, complex RBAC and to get anything deployed, you&#x27;ll need to write YAML manifest. But you also need to learn how to handle horizontal scaling, networking, secrets, ingress, and a hole lot more. The question is, why would a developer care about all this stuff. Developers don’t care about all the Kubernetes internals, they just like to get an HTTP(S) endpoint of their running application.

                    <span>Observability is the new buzzword. Or is it already a necessity for your software development? There is a lot of debate around observability and all its aspects. How do you define observability? How does it differ from monitoring? Does it replace or complement your monitoring practices?
We are not here to get into that debate. Keeping the jargon aside, let&#x27;s look at what stats say about observability. Is it making a difference for its adopters?
Hybrid multi-cloud systems have become the norm. It is one of the driving forces behind the need for observability. We have compiled 33 stats that show observability is the answer to cloud-native software development.

This is a bit of a different story in the series. When I came up with the concept for production horrors my thoughts were mostly about a single day or a single event that made our production fail. Naturally our mind gravitates towards crashes or issues like the recent Facebook outage. But last time around, I gave the example of problematic caching that led to a billing problem…

                    <span>Nebula Graph has just released v.2.6. In this version, TOSS is certainly one of the important features. Here a detailed explanation about TOSS will be given.
As we all know, there are two types of edges, directed and undirected edges. When traversing directed edges, you can traverse forward or reversely. Nebula Graph also supports this semantics. For example:
go from &quot;101&quot; over known reversely yield known.kdate, id($$);

The above statement starts from Vertex 101 to find all the corresponding neighbors reversely. However, when you insert an edge into Nebula Graph, the command will be like:
insert edge known(degree) VALUES &quot;100&quot; -&gt; &quot;101&quot;:(299792458);

Seemingly, the above statement only specifies the outgoing edge. This is because Nebula Graph will specify the incoming edge in the backgroun…</span>

The build process involves a series of automated tasks performed on raw source code to prepare that code for future deployment.
Instead of manually calling the compiler and package manager as dotnet restore/dotnet build, you can automate this process, especially if you are working with multiple solutions/projects that depend on each other and require certain steps to be built.

Rather, it provides many features and rich tools that help with:
Cleanup
Restore packages and dependencies
Compilation
Test automation
Post-build processing
Generating production builds
Packaging, creating Docker images, etc. 
Deployment between different environments
Notifications and reporting
Integration of 3-party applications
Version control

                    <span>Why Python packaging can be hard


There may be a time in your development career where you need to author a package that extends Python w/ C or C++. In such a case your Python package needs to go through a compilation process, which converts C or C++ to binaries that work for a specific target system. This becomes really tedious when you think about how many flavors and versions of Linux there are.  Building a separate binary for Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, etc... Ugh so tiring.
Why Python packaging can be easy w/ manylinux


Fortunately, there is a solution. manylinux was birthed to make it easy for your Python packages to be compatible with most Linux variants. manylinux takes advantage of the fact that most distributions are mindful of backwards compatibility, and intentionally builds bdist wheels on an old version of a distribution. The idea is that if we build on an old supported version, the binaries produced are compatible with current versions.
So what is a manylinux really? Is it a ham sandwich?


No. Even better. It&#x27;s a Docker image. manylinux is a Docker image built off a certain old versions of the CentOS operating system that comes bundled with libraries that are assumed to be present by default on almost all Linux systems.
You can find an example of manylinux distributions within the pandas project. Here are two (out of many) from the list of available pandas downloads from PyPI:
pandas-1.0.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
pandas-1.0.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_i686.whl

In this case, pandas has built manylinux wheels for CPython 3.7 supporting both x86-64 and i686 architectures. It&#x27;s manylinux so this wheel should be compatible for many linux :)
Happy packaging!</span>

I watched this video by Linus Tech Tips, and decided to improve on his criticisms to hopefully create a better guide to choosing your Linux gaming distro.
These are some common terms to know: 
DE/Desktop Environment: This is the GUI interface to your OS.
Terminal/TTY/Command Line: This is the text based interface to your OS.
As Linux is Free and Open Source Software, you can customize anything and everything you want on any distro. However, as this is a beginner focused guide, it mostly focuses on what is built in to a distro, not what is possible with a distro.

This distribution is simple to use, has a nice DE, and generally doesn&#x27;t get in your way. The breakage caused while installing linux in Linus&#x27; video is something that is trivial to fix. You can expect it to…</span>

                    <span>VS Code 🤯


VS Code seems to be the 1 size fit all code editor. VS Code offers really seamless integration to develop on a remote connection such as the WSL 2 with the simple installation of an extension.
If you don&#x27;t have it already, install VS Code from the official site. 

(You can also download the insiders build if you like living on the bleeding edge)
While installing VS Code, make sure to check the Add to Path option.

All you need to do is install the Remote - WSL Extension

Start a WSL 2 remote session
Ctrl + Shift + P and type in new wsl window to open up a new WSL 2 window and select the option

A new WSL 2 window should open up from the directory you were using.

It is advised to use VS Code from the Linux file system instead of the windows&#x27;. To do this just use the Open Folder option from the File menu.
Just traverse to ~ or $HOME directory and then add the projects to the Linux file system and use them from there.

Upon opening any projects in WSL window, you will see the WSL 2.0  connection on the bottom-left as well as the title bar.

                    <span>In my recent post Some Best Practices On Building An Integration, I espoused the benefits of using API owner supplied tools and libraries, and mentioned areas where a well-built SDK hides complexity from, or otherwise makes things easier for, a developer.
A colleague suggested that it might be useful to present examples of some of these areas to give some pointers for someone who needs to implement that functionality themselves, can&#x27;t make use of an SDK, or simply for someone looking to build their own API client. So, this is part 1 of a deep dive into functionality in FreshBooks&#x27; (and some other API owner&#x27;s) SDKs.
This first post won&#x27;t go too much into functionality as I think it&#x27;s best to start on structure.

                    <span>Building electronic circuits can be difficult especially the bigger ones,as there is no printf to check if wire is properly connected. Being an electrical engineering ,I have tried to build tools that would help understand and design electronics faster and better. Chip.io 
But in this project I want something more complex😈, 
However, I don&#x27;t discourage the possibility of using it to program integrated circuits🤔.
It&#x27;s basically a nodejs project which utilizes nearley and Moo to parse the code which is then converted to a particular javascript format that simulates logic circuit.
All of this began while I was trying to disign a circuit in logisim and was not able to do in the way I wanted it to be. Also at that time i had already started messing out with lexer and parsers, which finally led to this project. 
Build an interpreter that can run the code
Multiple libraries that implements complex circuits.
A graphic interface which can generate the code by drag n drop ( Similar to logisim )
Ability to program integrated circuits ( sometimes 😜)
Let me show you a sample of the program
module HalfAdder([a,b]&#x3D;&gt;[s,c])
{
    init{
        [s] &#x3D; [0];
        [c] &#x3D; [0];
    }
    process {
        [s] &#x3D; XOR([a,b]);
        [c] &#x3D; AND([a,b]);
    }
}
HalfAdder Adder;

Input [A] &#x3D; [0];
Input [B] &#x3D; [0];
Output [S];
Output [C];

wire(A &#x3D;&gt; Adder.a);
wire(B &#x3D;&gt; Adder.b);
wire(Adder.s &#x3D;&gt; S);
wire(Adder.c &#x3D;&gt; C);


And this would produce a circuit like 

I don&#x27;t want to go deep into the explanation but in simple terms we created a blue print for HalfAdder ,whose inputs are a and b, outputs are s and c. After which we instantiated a HalfAdder ( as Adder) which is connected to input ports A and B , Output Ports S and C
Any suggestions and feedbacks is greatly appreciated.
Thank you ❤️ for reading.</span>

                    <span>Today, many website owners want online payment gateways, especially as the industry has developed by leaps and bounds. Creating a wallet system is a bit of a nightmare when designing an app for the health sector, finance, or other sectors.
We will learn how to create a wallet system and how to integrate the Flutterwave payment system in this tutorial.
To follow along with this tutorial, we will need:
A working knowledge of JavaScript.
A good understanding of Node.js.
A basic understanding of MongoDB or any database of our choice.
Postman and some knowledge on how to use Postman.
We also need a Flutterwave account to receive or accept payments from our application.

                    <span>Are you wondering what is the real reason that has led to the popularity of Nodejs development? There are many reasons.
It&#x27;s the ideal solution for businesses looking to invest in a live-time running environment and application that spans platforms.
JavaScript support is one reason why developers are using Node.js for web application development It comes with a myriad of amazing features, including permitting developers to add web servers and network tools through JavaScript.
In the realm of product development, Node.js could be too complex for the novice, making the user nervous about making a web application that is successful.
However, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s difficult. Given how simple it is to accomplish the task with the help of two-way interaction between client and server is a great…</span>

                    <span>How do you increase productivity, especially when you want to multi-task and achieve so much in so little time? We have all encountered situations when our lead in an organisation instructs us to get (scrape) information off the internet, especially if we are in a team that does a lot of manual processes to achieve your work. Doing this with a pen and paper can lead to errors and missing out on specific information from the website.
This tutorial will demonstrate how to automate scraping data off of the website and using it for whatever purpose.
You can find the source code of the completed project on CodeSandbox. Fork, tweak the scripts and run the code.

Have you ever had developer teams request ownership of a full subscription to be able to freely experiment?
You still want to keep isolation, segregate responsibilities and permissions.
Ability to experiment freely is paramount to innovation, but uncontrolled proliferation of subscriptions can bear a significant management overhead.
Can we have the best of both worlds? The short answer is: yes.
A resource group can be an effective boundary as it allows its contributors to yet create any resource, but also restrict the scope of access within a subscription.
You can also enforce tags and Azure policies to control costs and enforce security.

                    <span>Angular v13 has arrived! And with it come a lot of exciting new features and updates. Angular continues to improve runtime performance, decrease compilation time, promote good software development practices, enhance developer experience, and keep up to date with dependencies such as TypeScript and RxJS. Is anyone else excited about RxJS v7?! 🤩 Let&#x27;s take a look at a few of the many new exciting features in Angular v13 with some code examples using authentication. 
With v13, View Engine is no longer available, replaced by Ivy. Ivy is the future of Angular applications, and the benefits are tremendous. After initially landing in v12, Ivy paves the way for new feature updates, simplifies existing capabilities, and increases rendering performance.

                    <span>ReactJS:
React (ReactJS, React.js) is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces that are open-source. Facebook created, developed, and supports this useful tool, which can be downloaded from their Github page. Facebook updates and creates new guides for this collection on a regular basis.
Advantages of ReactJS:
ReactJs has a lot of experience with SEO. While other Javascript does not allow SEO, you can easily run your ReactJS with the servers.
Disadvantages of ReactJS:
React technologies are evolving and developing at such a rapid pace that there is no time to properly document them. To get around this, developers write their own instructions when new versions and tools in their present projects evolve.
AngularJS:
AngularJS is a framework for building dynamic web applications. It allows you to utilize HTML as your template language and enhance HTML&#x27;s syntax to represent the components of your application clearly and succinctly. Data binding and dependency injection in AngularJS eliminate a lot of the code you&#x27;d have to write otherwise. And because it all happens in the browser, it&#x27;s a great companion for any server technology.
Advantages of AngularJS:
Because Angularjs is an open-source JavaScript MVC framework, anyone can create a custom application at a low cost.
Disadvantages of AngualrJS:
In Angular, there is no server authorization or authentication. Authorization is the process of granting data access authorization and identifying a user by validating credentials. Because AngularJs is unable to fulfill both functionalities, we refer to it as &quot;less secure.&quot;
AngularJs is totally dependent on JavaScript. If these scripts are hidden, the resulting pages appear to be rudimentary.
It&#x27;s huge and complicated. There are numerous ways to execute the same operation in angular, making it impossible to determine which method is the most efficient.
AngularJs is not supported by Internet Explorer 8.0.</span>

This article contains a list of tips and best practices for using the @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects libraries. The list is based on the usual NgRx mistakes I&#x27;ve seen many times (some of which I&#x27;ve made myself) and on the great talks and articles that you can find in the resources section.
Store Tips


Put global state in a single place
Don&#x27;t put the local state in the global store
Use selectors for the derived state
Use view model selectors
Treat actions as unique events
Group actions by source
Don&#x27;t dispatch actions conditionally
Create reusable reducers
Be careful with facades
Effects Tips


Name effects like functions
Keep effects simple
Don&#x27;t create &quot;boiler&quot; effects
Apply single responsibility principle
Apply good action hygiene

                    <span>Using an interesting Pi setup (Chipsee CM4-156) I needed to install docker and the instructions on their site we&#x27;re slightly incorrect to get it installed
Kept getting an error when it tried to find a docker release for &#x27;buster&#x27; and that&#x27;s the latest version supported by this little &#x27;all in one&#x27; device
Here&#x27;s what I ran to get it working
This part is the same:
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release

Add their GPG Key (same from site):
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

[Different] Remove previous entry (this was added when the first install failed, you may have done the same)
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list

[Different] Work around to install the correct docker image:
sudo curl -sL https://get.docker.com | sed &#x27;s/9)/10)/&#x27; | sh

They also serve the same function, which is to serve as a proxy between clients and applications on one side, and to a postgres instance on the other side. In that position, the first obvious advantage is that it can perform as an edge service, concentrating connections from one network, and proxy the requests to the database in a non-exposed network.
Another advantage is that the client/application side connections are decoupled from the database side connections, and therefore can serve badly behaving applications (which create and destroy connections to a d…</span>

                    <span>Hello beautiful people! After a long time, here I bring the 2nd Episode of the Linux for Hackers Series.
When it comes to Terminal, It’s the truly wheeled power of Linux. So please don’t use GUI in Linux. You should use Terminal instead of it.

So this is the where Terminal is in Kali Linux. Go ahead and click it…

So you can see here, Terminal opened up!
So this is the Linux Terminal, and this is how you are supposed to use Linux. Now if you’re coming from the GUI-only world Where all you use is a graphical user interface… Right!!!

So true, this might seem a little scary. I totally get it!!!

                    <span>I want to learn more about Linux. What better way than to make it my daily driver?
It&#x27;s been just over a month now so I figured I&#x27;d share my experience with using and installing Linux along with some of the surprises I encountered along the way.
Now, for the record, I&#x27;ve used Linux before but mostly for Docker build systems at work but I haven never used it as a daily driver on my desktop machine.
Guru or nooby - I hope you find this post useful or interesting in some way.
I chose Void Linux as my first image. It&#x27;s a very bare-bones distro, similar to Arch and Gentoo. I liked the idea of packages being audited by other developers before being allowed to be added to the registry. It also runs runit as its init system which I like the philosophy of (small codebase, single responsibility). Th…</span>

CRUD stands for Create(Insert data to database), Read (Retrieve data from database), Update (Edit data from database), and Delete (delete data from database) 
It is a popular design through which Web APIs interact with databases.
Set up an express server
Set up routes with express
Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose
Write mongoose models
Use Mongoose to make database queries
At least node 8.10 and npm &gt;&#x3D; 5.6
Working knowledge of nodeJS
JavaScript concepts like arrow functions, object destructuring, and async/await.

para conocer .Net Core debemos hablar un poco sobre los inicios de .Net.
.Net nacio en el año 2001, con la publicacion de los primeros estandares (334 y 335) en ECMA para C# y CLR(Common Language Runtime). Y en 2002 se libera .Net Framework 1.
Para el año 2008 Microsoft da el anuncio que el proyecto ASP.Net MVC será de tipo Open Source, ese mismo año en la conferencia //build/ Anders Hejlsberg anuncia que el compilador Roslyn de C# sera de tipo Open Source. Y es en 2008 que comienza el desarrollo de .Net Core.

In each case, the main question we want to answer is &quot;What could an adversary do if they got access to our database?&quot;
// Using Sequelize for the examples
async function saveUser(email, password) {
  await DbUser.create({
    email: email,
    password: password,
  })

async function isValidUser(email, password) {

OAuth 2 Core does not say what an access token (AT) should look like, only what it should be used for. Left to their own devices, the most important OAuth-based services and products chose to encode access tokens as JWTs. Without guidance from standards, however, they ended up producing as many incompatible variants.

This article is the story of how this issue bugged me so much that I took it on myself to work with the IETF standards community to try fixing it, culminating in the publication of a new standard document describing how to encode and validate an OAuth 2.0 AT in JWT format.

I am taking this opportunity to give you a glimpse of how the standardization process works, but most importantly: I hope …</span>

Whether using containers to support development or for packaging an application, it’s easy to take them for granted. But many things can go wrong with them: moved files, incorrect permissions, a user is missing, the Dockerfile is incomplete, the list goes on…
Containers are as crucial as the code they support. In this tutorial, we’ll introduce a different way of testing them before deployment.

WebAssembly is the new craze when it comes to frontend &amp; backend capabilities. The part that has me excited about it is the concept that you can use the same library for both frontend &amp; backend. (provided the backend is in Rust or NodeJs.)

Expected Prerequisites:
Rust
NodeJs

First, we need to establish the goal of this little tutorial. This tutorial is to give a little demonstration of how to simply get Webpack to compile our Rust code into WebAssembly and import it on the frontend. To get started, lets create a new folder and enter it:
mkdir -p ./wasm-demo

                    <span>I&#x27;m 7 months into coding now, simply love React so I dedicated to write my tech article about it.
You can consider a &#x27;classic&#x27; way of passing data, is passing data through a JSON list or Database.
This often causes having to re-deconstruct the State in each new child component. 
To avoid this you can use the useContext hook in React, and pass it&#x27;s props through a ContextProvider very easily.
This article will show you how to pass data from one central useContext that provides it&#x27;s props to all components.

ngDoCheck life-cycle hook


The official definition of this life-cycle hook goes like this:
&quot;Detect and act upon changes that Angular can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t detect on its own. Called immediately after ngOnChanges() on every change detection run, and immediately after ngOnInit() on the first run.&quot;
Simply put, Angular tracks binding inputs by object reference. It means that if an object reference hasn’t changed, the binding change is not detected and change detection is not executed. This is where we need ngDoCheck.
It is very important to …</span>

                    <span>To be able to load external libraries it is good to have a service which is responsible to load those scripts!
It will be looks like this
@Injectable({providedIn: &#x27;root&#x27;})
export class ExternalLibrariesService {
  static injectLib(src: string): void {
    const script &#x3D; document.createElement(&#x27;script&#x27;);
    script.src &#x3D; src;
    document.body.appendChild(script);
  }
}

With that service we can easily add external libraries as much as we want!

@Component({

  template: &#x60;&#x60;,
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {

This blog covers how to install lw-scanner and leverage it to perform image assurance scans from within VS Code.
Install lw-scanner
support.lacework.com and the the latest release of the scanner binary can be found at github.com
Once lw-scanner is installed the next step is to download the Lacework plugin from the VS Code Marketplace.

With an active Dockerfile in the editor you can initiate an image assurance scan by clicking Command+Shift+P on macOS (Control+Shift+P on Windows/Linux).

Once the scan is complete you will see a summary next to the base image that will disappear along with a more detailed scan result available in the output window.

Source code can be found here for now: github.
This is just a quick preview update. For suggestions or feedback please open an issue on the repo. PRs welcomed. Stay tuned for more.

                    <span>Why rate limit?


Rate limiting is a simple way of stopping users (hopefully just the bad ones!) from accessing more of your sites resources than you would like.
I will show you a simple way to rate limit specific URLs by using Nginx.
The written instructions are below, but here is a quick video walkthrough showing how to apply rate limiting in Nginx.





  
  
  How to add rate limiting in nginx


At the top of you nginx file, you can define a map like so:
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr_map zone&#x3D;mylimit:10m rate&#x3D;5r/s;
limit_req_status 429;

map $request_uri $binary_remote_addr_map {
    default &quot;&quot;;
    ~^/what-is-new.html $binary_remote_addr;
    ~^/another-url-to-rate-limit.html $binary_remote_addr;
}

Then within your location block, add:
limit_req zone&#x3D;mylimit;

And that&#x27;s it! Now only webpages matching the $request_uri will have rate limiting applied. This is handy when you have all of your request being routed through a single place, but you only want to have specific pages on your site rate limited.</span>

                    <span>According to a recent research by Cambridge University&#x27;s Nicholas Boucher and Ross Anderson, there are two vulnerabilities that impact most code compilers.
These sorts of vulnerabilities have an impact on software supply chains; for example, if an attacker successfully commits code injection by deceiving human reviewers, future software is likely to inherit the vulnerability.
But let&#x27;s look at the technique:
Extended strings: make sections of string literals seem as code, having the same impact as comments and causing string comparison to fail.


Comment out: forces a comment to appear as code, which is then ignored.


Early returns: bypass a function by running a return statement that seems to be inside a comment.

                    <span>Writing CSS has probably never been more fun and exciting than it is today. In this post we’ll take a look at common problems and use cases we all have to face in our work and how to solve them with modern CSS. If you’re interested, we’ve also just recently covered [CSS auditing tools](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/css-auditing-tools/), [CSS generators](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/css-generators/), [front-end boilerplates](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/useful-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits/) and [VS code extensions](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/05/useful-vs-code-extensions-web-developers/) — you might find them useful, too.</span>
