                    <span>Fetching data from an API either from an external source or from the Backend of your application can be done in many ways.
In this Quick guide, I would show you how to fetch data in a react app by making an HTTP request to a REST API using 4 different patterns.
Before I begin, let‚Äôs have a refresher on what REST APIs are:
What is a REST API?
A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for ‚ÄúREpresentational State Transfer‚Äù.
In this guide, we would be making use of the Github REST API and its sample response looks like this:

                    <span>A Brief History of Passwordless
Passwords have been our main digital authentication method since 1961, though its¬†vulnerability to hacking¬†was demonstrated within one year.
Encrypted password storage and public-key cryptography were developed in the late 60s to early 70s.
But the 1980s brought the first version of &quot;passwordless&quot; authentication. This came in the form of dynamic, one-time passwords (OTP) held on physical fobs.
OTPs eventually developed into two protocols: time-based OTPs (TOTP) and cryptographed hash-based message authentication codes or HMAC OTPs (HOTP). Dynamic OTPs are still widely used as an authentication protocol.
The late 1990s brought single sign-on (SSO) into use. SSO helped organizations manage user authentication across an entire network of applications. However, ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>What is Passwordless Authentication?
Passwordless authentication is exactly what it sounds like: an authentication strategy to verify user identity without the need for the user to manually enter knowledge-based information.
As we outlined in the previous article in this series, passwordless methodologies have been in use since the 1980&#x27;s, but were ultimately popularized in the 2000&#x27;s as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on (SSO) became standards.
From MFA and SSO to &#x27;passwordless&#x27;
Multi-factor authentication requires users to provide multiple unique ways of identifying themselves, which can include:
  Something the user knows, like an ID number, user name, and/or password
  Something the user has, like a token, authenticator app, ubikey, email address, or phone number

TypeScript simplifies JavaScript code, making it easier to read and debug. TypeScript provides highly productive development tools for JavaScript IDEs and practices, like static checking. TypeScript makes code easier to read and understand. With TypeScript, we can make a huge improvement over plain JavaScript.
There are many more benefits of TypeScript over Javascript:

                    <span>This week I have to add another two features in my program, which is inline code block and horizontal rule. To be honest, I am able to know Git can do so many things out there, working with multiple branches in parallel is an example of this week.
Speaking of the inline code block, I simply added another regex inside my splitInParagraphs function, which finds the text enclosed with backtick and then converting it to ..text... Thanks to my previous lab, I already had the idea of adding new features inside my program later one. I also use another regex to support converting --- to 
 tag.
When I satisfy and try to test my program, everything works perfectly as I expect, then merging into my main branch. At first, the inline code block was merged smoothly with a fast-forward. However, when I merged the horizontal rule, it caused conflict because I modified the file for the second time with different issue, the content of the file is newer so it did not allow me to merge at that time. 
VSCode is really amazing, it detects my problem, and it shows some options I could do, which is Compare or Overwrite. I try both option in order to know the reason why I could not merge my second branch. I fix it by overwriting on my current file, and the branch is merged successfully.
This lab gives me a chance to practice with merge conflicts, and I am able to know what to do when I face the same problem again.</span>

My name is Andrew Bonacci. I&#x27;m 31 years old, happily married and have recently embarked on a web development journey. I had my first try at HTML back in the early 2000s on the blogging website called Xanga. 14-year-old me thought it was so cool that I could make text do different things by modifying the markups. As time went on, I had some practice with Lua in ROBLOX when I was a late teenager. I didn&#x27;t get very far because I lacked proper guidance, but I was able to tinker with some of the code and bring my creations to life.
However, as much as I enjoyed these things, they never became much more than a hobby. Rather, I pursued education because of my desire to make a difference in the lives of others. Even throughout my time as an educator, the one constant has always been s‚Ä¶</span>

After you have learnt Docker üê≥   you can start creating very complex applications with tens or even hundreds of containers, with containers talking to each other and interacting in some way.
overhead and effort you would have, if you had to manage these hundreds of containers manually without automation. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Every time containers crash or the communication between them isn‚Äôt working across multiple servers, you would have to interfere and fix the problem.

The age of digital disruption dictates the requirements of the current and future workforce and the existing workforce is unprepared to address the emerging trends and developments of the future.

                    <span>Latest Docker Compose (v2)


https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/
Now, the command is no longer docker-compose (although there is compose-switch), but rather, a Docker plugin, docker compose.
For some reasons, it had to rebuild my Dockerfile image again, even though I have built (and tagged) it before.
I saw that there that are releases for Windows and macOS (darwin, including arm64) as well; and it is already installed by default on Windows and macOS.
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
This one has absolutely my expected behavior. Nothing special. No surprise dangers.
podman-compose


This one uses podman, which is probably only available in Linux (and macOS), and requires podman.service user unit; so, probably cannot be started in Windows&#x27; WSL.
Goodies, other than can be rootless podman (i.e. no root privileges, nor usermod -aG docker $USER); is that it actually create a &quot;pod&quot; containing multiple containers.
So, what are unexpected behaviors I have found?
Cannot attach to virtual volumes, nor attach to non-existent folders (will not create a new folder)
podman-compose up $SERVICE_NAME does not work, unlike docker-compose


Ctrl+C does not destroy pod, nor &quot;down&quot;, so podman-compose up &gt;&gt; Ctrl+C &gt;&gt; podman-compose up will give some friendly(?) errors


In contrast, docker-compose up &gt;&gt; Ctrl+C &gt;&gt; docker-compose up throws no error; also noticeably, logs  continue (just like Ctrl+X &gt;&gt; kill -CONT)
So, is Podman better than Docker, or is Docker itself getting better than alternatives?</span>

                    <span>AWS Fault Injection Simulator is fully managed chaos engineering service used for improve application resiliency. It provides environment to safely performed controlled chaos engineering experiment on AWS. Today&#x27;s Distributed system are to complex and it&#x27;s hard to find if any fault occur and  how to reduce the chances of the unwanted scenario happening in the first place.
Chaos engineering is the process of stressing an application by creating disruptive events. It&#x27;s help to create the real-world conditions to uncover hidden issues,monitoring blind spots and performance bottlenecks.
How It Works?
It starts with analyzing the steady-state behavior

Building an experiment hypothesis

                    <span>Nebula-Kind, an one-liner command to try K8s Operator based Nebula Graph Cluster on your machine, with the help of KIND (K8s in Docker)
As a Cloud Native Distributed Database, Nebula Graph comes with an open-source K8s Operator to enable boostrap and maintain Nebula Graph Cluster from a K8s CRD.
Normally it takes you some time to setup all the dependencies and control plane resources of the Nebula Operator. If you are as lazy as I am, this Nebula-Operator-Kind is made for you to quick start and play with Nebula Graph in KIND.
Nebula-Operator-Kind is the one-liner for setup everything for you including:
Docker
Install Nebula-Operator-Kind:
curl -sL nebula-kind.siwei.io/install.sh | bash

You will see this after it‚Äôs done

You can connect to the cluster via ~/.nebula-kind/bin/console as below:
~/.nebula-kind/bin/console -u user -p password --address&#x3D;127.0.0.1 --port&#x3D;30000

It‚Äôs in GitHub with more information you may be intrested in ;-), please try and feedback there~ https://github.com/wey-gu/nebula-operator-kind
Install on KubeSphere all-in-on clusterÔºö
curl -sL nebula-kind.siwei.io/install-ks-1.sh | bash

                    <span>AWS EC2 load balancer is one of the most popular service offer by Amazon Web Service. In this post we shall be exploring AWS load balancer, types of AWS load balancers, when to use them and how to setup load balancers on AWS Management console.
load Balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 instances) downstream.

1.Spread load across multiple downstream instances
An ELB(EC2 Load Balancer ) is a managed load balancers by AWS. Meaning AWS guarantees that it will be working. AWS takes care of upgrades ,maintenance, high availability across multiple zones. It costs less to setup your own load balancers but it would be a lot of effort on your end.
They are support important for load balancers. They enable the load balancer to know if instances it forward traffic to are available to reply to requests. The health check is done on a port and a route. If  the response is not 200 (OK) ,then the instance is unhealthy.

1.Classic load Balances(V1 -old generation)-2009
Load Balancer can scale but not instantaneously if you have a massive scale to do you need to contact AWS for a &quot;Warm-up&quot;.
For Troubleshooting
In the next post we shall be setting up ELb .Thanks for reading.</span>

                    <span>Docker takes care of the networking aspects so that containers can communicate with other containers and also with the Docker Host.
Docker networking subsystem is pluggable, using drivers. 
There are several drivers available by default and provides core networking functionality.
bridge 
host
overlay
macvlan
none
We can check what all the network drivers are supported by Docker Containers and also at what ip that driver is configured to connect to the other containers.
docker network ls

if you want to check particular network driver is running at what IP, we can inspect that network driver
docker inspect bridge


We can check what all drivers what containers are running and what are not by simply inspecting that particular network driver.

                    <span>Introduction


Hello everyone, my name is Dustin, today I want to write a blog about my progress of working with branches in Git. So this is the lab 03, which I have to create 2 parallel branches to work on different aspects of the program.
First off, I needed to decide what to add to my program. At the time, I had a few options like changing code block, or hr, or exit code for my program... So I thought that the exit code is a must that my program needed to have and the code block thing is quite more interesting than hr. After choosing what I needed to do, I had to file 2 issues so I had something to refer back to. 
The 2 issues I was talking about:
First one
Second one
Writing code for these 2 issues are quite straightforward. It took me a few minutes to finish it. However, I&#x27;m not so sure about the inline code block thing, and should ask my professor about it to make sure that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s looking for. 
So, for the first issue, I created a new branch called issue-18 and issue-19 for the second issue. When finishing the first issue, I had to git add and git commit and switched to branch issue-19 to continue coding. As I&#x27;ve done it, I also had to git add and git commit. After that, I had to use merge to merge those 2 branches. 
I used git merge issue-18 which is my first issue, git had no problem merging it. It was fast forward right away. However, for the second issue, when I git merge issue-19, instead of fast forward, Git used three way recursive strategy. Then, I just needed to push it to github so the code will be visible to everyone.

Speaker.app is a batteries-included, quasi-decentralized, alternative free speech audio platform that is compatible on any device that supports a modern web browser.
Rather than a centralized server providing proxying of streams from each participant to other participants (i.e. an MCU / SFU), one can choose to host a network (or &quot;room&quot;) where others can connect to, either publicly or privately.  The network hosting participant&#x27;s web browser acts as the &quot;server&quot; for the other participants to connect to on the given network, and all proxying is done, including message storage and relaying, through that browser.
Public networks are visible in a &quot;network discovery&quot; view, which serves as the default homepage for the application.

SuperApiBoost es un cliente con dos comandos para generar una API REST NodeJS con lenguaje TypeScript usando express para las peticiones y mongoose para base de datos.
npm i -g superapiboost

sabo new -n&#x3D;[NOMBRE]

Este generar√° la siguiente estructura:
üì¶API
 ‚î£ üìÇnode_modules
 ‚î£ üìÇsrc
 ‚îÉ ‚î£ üìÇapi
 ‚îÉ ‚îÉ ‚î£ üìÇroutes
 ‚îÉ ‚îÉ ‚îó üìúindex.ts
 ‚îÉ ‚î£ üìÇcontrollers
 ‚îÉ ‚îÉ ‚îó üìúmongoBasic.ts #Basic CRUD Methods
 ‚îÉ ‚î£ üìÇinterfaces
 ‚îÉ ‚î£ üìÇtools #transversal functions in the project
 ‚îÉ ‚îÉ ‚îó üìúvalidateType.ts
 ‚îÉ ‚î£ üìúapp.ts
 ‚îÉ ‚î£ üìúconfig.ts
 ‚îÉ ‚îó üìúmongo.ts
 ‚î£ üìúpackage-lock.json
 ‚î£ üìúpackage.json
 ‚îó üìútsconfig.json

Antes de arrancar el proyecto se debe agregar el uri de mongo en el archivo config.ts
y despues ejecutar
npm start

Para crear las rutas y controladores se debe crear un archivo .json con la siguiente estructura:
{
  &quot;name&quot;:{
    &quot;type&quot;:&quot;string&quot;,
    &quot;required&quot;:true,
    &quot;default&quot;:&quot;&#x27;Andy&#x27;&quot;
  },
  &quot;cellphone&quot;:{
    &quot;type&quot;:&quot;number&quot;,
    &quot;required&quot;:false
  },
  &quot;isValid&quot;:{
    &quot;type&quot;:&quot;boolean&quot;,
    &quot;required&quot;:true,
    &quot;default&quot;:&quot;true&quot;
  }
}

Y se debe ejecutar el siguiente comando para generar la ruta y controladores:
sabo generate -n&#x3D;User -p&#x3D;&quot;C:\models\user.json&quot;

Arrancamos el proyecto con
npm start

Y ya se puede consumir el api rest desde cualquier cliente.</span>

Writing code in a file is fine, but if your application need a lot of code, your file will quickly become too large.
This is why it is better to separate your code into several modules (file) in order to make the code reusable and much better structured.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been in the software industry for more than 15 years, most of that time, from one way or another, I always have to use javascript for the frontend or backend, but always feels I&#x27;m missing something, the language is not excellent enough to apply the uncle Bob suggestions, for example defining interfaces.
For that reason and a lot more, I&#x27;ve decided to move forward and start to use typescript in all my professional work, that reason can be a post itself, but in this post, I going to explain how you can create an Express Application using typescript from the beginning.
First of all, we have to create a brand new project using yarn but if you prefer you can use Npm, that is completely up to you.

cd ts-node-app

                    <span>üîç Here‚Äôs an easy-to-understand analogy to help your non-technical friends and customers understand public keys and private keys, and how they relate to cryptography and digital signatures.



  
  
  
If you work in cybersecurity or any computer-related field, sooner or later, you‚Äôll have to explain public-key cryptography and digital signatures to non-technical people. With the recent rise of remote work and stories about system breaches, computer security has become a topic of discussion even among laypeople.
After trying to explain public-key cryptography and digital signatures to some clients with varying degrees of success, I wanted to develop an analogy that explained them and was easy to remember. I‚Äôve found that even techies get confused by the formal definitions, and many non-technical explanations just seem unsatisfying.
That‚Äôs when I stumbled upon Panayotis Vryonis‚Äô article, Public-key cryptography for non-geeks. It became my go-to analogy until my computer science professor, Dr. Robin Dawes pointed out a flaw. I refined it with his help, and a suggestion from Matthew Ernest, and the result is below. I hope you find it helpful when trying to explain these concepts to anyone!
Imagine a box with a special lock, as pictured below:

The lock has three positions:
When the lock is at the ‚Äú9:00‚Äù position, the box is locked, and its contents are inaccessible.
When the lock is at the ‚Äú12:00‚Äù position, the box is unlocked, which means you can open it and view its contents.
When the lock is at the ‚Äú3:00‚Äù position, the box is locked, and its contents are inaccessible.
In order to avoid wandering into endless ‚ÄúWhat if...?‚Äù tangents, assume that it‚Äôs prohibitively costly to pick the lock or break the box.

At the same time, ignoring privacy measures comes at a hefty price.

What‚Äôs worse is having spyware on your device that acts as a spy agent who secretly monitors your activities on the device.
The most reliable way to beef up your online privacy and security is to employ a VPN. A VPN ensures the safety of your online activities by encrypting your entire online data before it is sent

A dictionary is a common data structure in a programming language. As JavaScript developers, it‚Äôs important to work with type-safe dictionaries because there will be conflicts or unexpected issues if we store different types of data within the same dictionary.
In this article, we‚Äôll cover how to build a type-safe dictionary using TypeScript.
First of all, we need to know what a dictionary is. In a programming language, a dictionary is a typical data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. JavaScript, however, does not offer a Dictionary type. Thankfully, we can create a type-safe dictionary in a few simple ways.
Object types in JavaScript


There are two primary ways to create a dictionary in JavaScript: using the Object type and using key-value pairs. The‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Using reducers in the React Context api leaves a lot of room for error, even when using TypeScript. A reducer takes a single argument and returns a state. The common format for the argument is an object with an action property and a payload or value property. The action&#x27;s value is generally a string such as setTitle. In the case of action:&#x27;setTitle&#x27;, the value would then be the title you want to set on the state object. The problems with this approach are:
You have to look back at the reducer to see what the correct spelling and valid values of action are.
There is no type checking of the values that are linked with the action.
This article assumes that you have a basic familiarity with React, useReducer, and TypeScript.

In this shot, I‚Äôll show you the usages of the useCallback hook for better performance of your application, and explain why you should use it.

                    <span>Vue performs DOM updates asynchronously! But what does mean?
I will begin by explain you what is going on if we don&#x27;t use an async update queue.
Imagine that we have an array and we show it into the DOM, each time we push a new item, we will render the DOM.

It&#x27;s not really dramatic if we only add some items. But imagine if we decide to add 1000 items in this array at the same moment, we will render our DOM 1000 times! Your DOM will explode ü§Ø.
We don&#x27;t really need to update the DOM 1000 times, we only need one time, and we should only update it when we finish to add all items!
Vue performs DOM updates asynchronously. Whenever a data change is observed (in our case, adding item into our array), it will NOT directly update the DOM, it will add all change into a queue (buffer).

                    <span>This library is great for displaying the &#x27;active&#x27; users of your React application. The responsiveness of react-avatar-group is meant to be similar to the Google Docs user icons. Some live examples are available here.
If you need a more in-depth tutorial on using this package with actual, live users, check out this post here. Otherwise, here&#x27;s a quick walk-through on how to use this package.

First, install the package:
npm install react-avatar-group

Then open up your React file and import the package, as follows:
// App.tsx
import AvatarGroup from &#x27;react-avatar-group&#x27;;

export default function App(){
  
}

The only required prop to the AvatarGroup component is avatars, which is an array of strings or IAvatar objects, for more customization.
Another important prop is max. This will hide the avatars beyond a certain length with a custom overflow avatar (as seen in the gif above). displayAllOnHover will show all minions passed when the mouse hovers the avatar group, if there is a max number passed.
All the props for react-avatar-group can be seen here.
Using these other props, your AvatarGroup may look like the following:
import AvatarGroup from &#x27;react-avatar-group&#x27;;

export default function App(){
  
}</span>

                    <span>An offhand comment I wrote one day while eating lunch sparked an unexpected and interesting debate with Mark Erikson, one of the maintainers of Redux.
Redux has long been the go-to library for managing global state in React applications. Redux Toolkit, which Mark helped create, is a relatively new library that aims to be the &quot;official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.&quot; This post will go into my thoughts on the benefits and potential drawbacks of Redux Toolkit.
It&#x27;s unopinionated. Redux requires you to put your global state in a store, and to manage that state via reducers and actions. An action is a simple JavaScript object with a type property, and a reducer is a pure function that transforms the old state into the new state based on an action. Beyo‚Ä¶</span>

TypeScript simplifies JavaScript code, making it easier to read and debug. TypeScript provides highly productive development tools for JavaScript IDEs and practices, like static checking. TypeScript makes code easier to read and understand. With TypeScript, we can make a huge improvement over plain JavaScript.
There are many more benefits of TypeScript over Javascript:

                    <span>This is a guide to help you set up React Context API with typescript.
Context is designed to share data that can be considered ‚Äúglobal‚Äù for a tree of React components, This prevents Prop drilling and allows you to pass data around your react component tree efficiently.
There are external libraries like Redux that help with this, but luckily react implemented a built-in feature called React Context API that does this perfectly.
Let&#x27;s dive in! üòÅ
To set up the project we need to first create a create-react-app application with the typescript template, To do this open up a terminal window and run the command
npx create-react-app context-typescript --template typescript

# or

yarn create react-app context-typescript --template typescript

Open the context-typescript directory in your favorite‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>I love Typescript and enjoy using it. However, it&#x27;s not perfect and has its downsides.
Some downsides of Typescript (based on my experiences and what others have shared):
another thing to learn
more code boilerplate, especially for 3rd party libraries (glares at Redux)
installation costs initial time (but it makes up for it later with the type safety)
npm modules without typedef are difficult to work with TS
it only starts to pay off once your codebase gets larger and complex 
the resources are scattered in multiple places (no universal, comprehensive resource like MDN; I find the Typescript handbook lacking)
slower compile/build time
I most likely will use Typescript for most of my projects from here on, unless a third-party library has no type definitions or doesn&#x27;t work well with it.
This post only expresses my thoughts and opinions (based on my limited knowledge) and is in no way a substitute for actual references. If I ever make a mistake or if you disagree, I would appreciate corrections in the comments!</span>

                    <span>Motivation


I&#x27;m working on an app that had a requirement to show toast notifications for the various actions that were performed by the user or alerting on errors while performing background tasks. The app frontend is built using Vue 3 and typescript. 
So I started searching for a Vue 3 plugin to cut down on building my own but after spending a couple of hours and looking at the various options currently available I decided to build my own version.
A number of coffees and quite a few hair pulling hours later I finally came up with a solution. It took a couple more hours to build and test my theory and here I am to share what I did.
Notifications can be created from any component, route.
Should be able to create info, warning, error and success notifications.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been in the software industry for more than 15 years, most of that time, from one way or another, I always have to use javascript for the frontend or backend, but always feels I&#x27;m missing something, the language is not excellent enough to apply the uncle Bob suggestions, for example defining interfaces.
For that reason and a lot more, I&#x27;ve decided to move forward and start to use typescript in all my professional work, that reason can be a post itself, but in this post, I going to explain how you can create an Express Application using typescript from the beginning.
First of all, we have to create a brand new project using yarn but if you prefer you can use Npm, that is completely up to you.

I can&#x27;t really remember what I was googling when I saw an advert by flexiple .So I sign up and the company recruiter schedule a call with me the following week.
After this process, flexiple prepared my CV by trying to  organize it to suite potential client i would work with in the future. Which was pretty straight forward and fast.
The final stage was divided into two stages
So I had to start preparing for this interview with leetcode and Hacker Ranker. I  started practicing algorithm, learnt recursion, binary search, Hash tree etc. 
To prepare further someone shared a picture of some AlogExpert algorithms  questions and  how it helped him land is current  job .I took a screen shot and started solving this algorithms one after the other .Note  I didn&#x27;t solve all

Can we generate a PDF from that?
Let&#x27;s see how I did it.
First, you&#x27;ll need some help, so run the following commands:
npm i --save dom-to-image
npm i --save jspdf

Once we have this two packages, we can use them in our code 
import { jsPDF } from &#x27;jspdf&#x27;;
import domtoimage from &#x27;dom-to-image&#x27;;

Add an ID to the HTML element you want to print:

    
 {
         const doc &#x3D; new jsPDF(dashboardWidth &gt; dashboardHeight ? &#x27;l&#x27; : &#x27;p&#x27;, &#x27;mm&#x27;, [dashboardWidth, dashboardHeight]);
         const imgProps &#x3D; doc.getImageProperties(imgData);
         const pdfWidth &#x3D; doc.internal.pageSize.getWidth();
         const pdfHeight &#x3D; (imgProps.height * pdfWidth) / imgProps.width;

         doc.addImage(imgData, &#x27;PNG&#x27;, 0, 0, pdfWidth, pdfHeight);
         doc.save(&#x27;Dashboard for hyperpanels.pdf&#x27;);
    });
}

This will create a PDF that will be saved from your browser:

And voil√°, your HTML turned into a PDF:

                    <span>PrimeNG¬†is a design-agnostic UI component library for Angular thanks to its flexible¬†theming system. Today we‚Äôre excited to announce the new free Tailwind theme to join the already impressive lineup featuring Material, Bootstrap, FluentUI and PrimeOnes themes.
The new theme uses the official color palette from Tailwind and based on the design bits at Tailwind UI such as forms, modals and menus. If you are utilizing tailwind ui and looking for a fully featured UI component library, PrimeFaces with the Tailwind theme will be an excellent choice. Note that, the theme does not use tailwind classes and instead provides a look-alike style for a unified design when used together.

Image is a new addition to the UI suite to display an image with transformation options like rotate and zoom. For multiple images, please see the Galleria.

There are over 30 improvements in this release, defect fixes are mostly based on community feedback so thank you for helping us to make the library better.
PrimeNG is licensed under MIT and free to download at NPM.
Our current focus is on improving accessibility by creating a dedicated section per component for keyboard support and screen readers along with scores from audit tools.</span>

                    <span>Environment variables in an Angular app are extremely useful for storing constants in your app that need to be used frequently, such as API url&#x27;s, API access keys, Firebase config values and other general flags.
When a new Angular app is created via the CLI tooling using ng new, one of the folders generated is &#x27;environments&#x27;.
By default, this folder contains two files:
- environment.ts
- environment.prod.ts
These files come prepopulated with the following code:
environment.ts:
export const environment &#x3D; {
  production: false,
};

environment.prod.ts:
export const environment &#x3D; {
  production: true,
};

The simple explanation of the usage of these files is that any values added into an environment file are injected into the compiled files when the Angular app is built.

                    <span>I do not like to subscribe to observables inside services, as it feels expensive due to the fact that we are not able to unsubscribe from them when we do not need them any more and we all hate memory leaks, right?
So the best way to use this solution will be the way that we would be able to unsubscribe from them when we done listening to that observable.
First, we should not create that service as Singleton service, instead we should make sure the service will be specifically responsible only to handle some functionalities which is related to small part of our app at presentation layer or better to say, it will only take care of logics which related to the Dump component. It does not mean it should not be there for make container/smart components more simple, but in this example I was tryi‚Ä¶</span>

1.Enhanced feature ownership
Full-stack developers tend to implement features from beginning to end. They usually develop better concepts for applying and testing those features, given that they are 100% accountable for the production outcomes.
They are aware of the process of interaction of the components of the system and see the majority of the areas which have been impacted in the project that can break and require modifications. 
If something is not working, it will be their code, and they will be capable of debugging it without disturbing other folks. The product‚Äôs quality increases a lot thanks to this type of focus and commitment, and the number of glitches is minimized.

                    <span>Linux sometimes seems to be very difficult from the outside but once you get a head start there are a ton of possibilities with linux which are not available with windows. Obviously you may not get as attractive and beginner friendly interface as windows does but everything comes with a price doesn&#x27;t it.
Here I will list 10 commands and explain them which you could try out yourself on your linux OS right away and experience it yourselves. 
df

this command will show the amount of available disk space and used disk space for file system to which you as a user currently has access to. For eg : if you have a dual boot system established in your pc and your linux OS doesn&#x27;t have access to the D folder.If you run this command on your linux terminal then you wont be able to see the partiton of used and unused space of D folder. this command is same as when you open the disk management tool in windows.



top

This command when you type in your terminal it will show the active linux processes which are managed by your linux kernel. This command is used like how you would use task manager in windows, the difference being , it shows the details of all the processes in far more depth than windows does.
it will look something like this when you type the command.


this is what is meant by each column head.

you can press &#x27;q&#x27; to exit this window in your termial.
ls
  


cd
cd [directory name]
cd ..


touch
touch [filename.extension]</span>

I&#x27;m someone who is now using Linux as my main OS but remember quite well how difficult it was to get my head around the workings of Linux my first few weeks.
So today i&#x27;m going to share a number of helpful commands to get you on your way!
Does exactly what it says on the tin.... it helps you change your directory in the company line. So for example, if you want to go into your download directory you can do the following;
cd /home/username/Downloads/

You can also  use  the shorthand  version;
cd ~/Downloads

The important bit of the second command is the ~ and the /
The tilde (~) is the Linux shortcut for the home directory whereas ~/ references the start of a directory in the logged in users folder.

Want to go back 1 folder? you can do the following instead of typing the ‚Ä¶</span>

The tl;dr is:
# read the YubiKey
echo &quot;Press your YubiKey&quot;
read -rs YUBIKEY

A YubiKey is a device made by Yubico intended as a form of MFA.
Generally, it&#x27;s a USB device that is used to obtain access to sensitive resources.
Yubico provides a cli, ykman, for the YubiKey. The intention of ykman is to allow IT administrators to configure YubiKeys for their organizations. 
I thought that it would be cool to have some shell scripts around for common APIs within my organization, but some of these require a credential generated from my YubiKey. My logic was that perhaps ykman could script the YubiKey credential generation for me.
I googled for an hour and only came up with a couple discussions about this. Unfortunately, one of them held some bad news:
I don&#x27;t think there is a way to programmatically get a YubiOTP from the YubiKey
from discussion on ykman issue 400
The solution is a quick-and-dirty &quot;silent read&quot; from the terminal:
# read the YubiKey
echo &quot;Press your YubiKey&quot;
read -rs YUBIKEY
echo &quot;Thank you&quot;

I thought I&#x27;d post that in case someone else goes searching for it in the future.</span>

Linux has had support for Full Disk Encryption and technologies such as UEFI Secure Boot and TPMs for a long time. They are usually set up suboptimally in distributions.
Supported:
[x] Full Disk Encryption
[x] UEFI SecureBoot
[x] TPMs
We can separate the mechanisms and tools that we have to perform confidentiality and integrity operations in our systems in two large categories; disk encryption and data authentication. 
Before we dive into the direction of listing the technologies and tools that are available for each aformentioned category, it would be useful to explain the two concepts. 
Disk encryption translates into the process of transforming the data contained within a disk in such a way that reading them in clear-text form‚Ä¶</span>

openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /home/user/Nvidia.key -outform DER -out /home/user/Nvidia.der -nodes -days 36500 -subj &quot;/CN&#x3D;Graphics Drivers&quot;

First command will ask for a password. After reboot enter the same password. (** Prompt will ask for characters in specific position of the password. Do not enter the whole password. **)
sudo mokutil --import /home/user/Nvidia.der
sudo reboot

Check if keys are enrolled
sudo mokutil --list-enrolled # or sudo mokutil --list-enrolled | grep -i Graphics

Updated the /etc/dkms/sign_helper.sh. Add/update the line with the newly created key paths.
/lib/modules/&quot;$1&quot;/build/scripts/sign-file sha512 /home/user/Nvidia.priv /home/user/Nvidia.der &quot;$2&quot;
Update /etc/dkms/framework.conf Uncomment the line where sign_tool is mentioned
sign_tool&#x3D;&quot;/etc/dkms/sign_helper.sh&quot;
If you have already added dkms modules before changing the sign file, first remove and then add them again.
sudo dkms status # Check status of dkms module
sudo dkms remove / -k 
Eg. sudo dkms remove hid-asus-rog/1.0.2 -k 5.10.0-8-amd64
sudo dkms status # Check uninstalled again
sudo dkms add . # in the cloned directory of dkms module
sudo dkms build /
sudo dkms install /

For installing Nvidia driver using the .run file and enrolled keys. Get-the-Driver-here
sudo sh ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-460.73.01.run -s --module-signing-secret-key&#x3D;/home/user/Nvidia.key --module-signing-public-key&#x3D;/home/user/Nvidia.der

                    <span>After a long time, I got have to find out the way to deploy an express application to Vercel.com with typescript language.
Following the steps below:
git clone 

npm init -y

sudo npm install -g vercel

vercel login

npm install typescript @types/express vercel

express package to build a server.





npm install express

package.json





  ...
  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;start&quot;: &quot;vercel dev&quot;,
    &quot;deploy&quot; : &quot;vercel deploy --prod&quot;
  },
  ...

/api in root source code.





mkdir api

/api is endpoint folder where to run your API in server Vercel. Make sure all files API are in there.
Example: I need api to say hello in URL : /api




touch /api/index.ts

import { Request, Response } from &quot;express&quot;;

                    <span>We all know that API keys and connections can not be secured on the client side of an application. Hard coding API keys on the frontend is a quick and surefire way to have your API connection shutdown, API keys stolen, and have your API provider‚Äôs bill skyrocket. So what options are there if you do not want to maintain back end infrastructure? We will explore the recommended techniques for integrating 3rd party APIs into client side applications without having to build a backend. Then we will walk you through a step by step example of integrating a private API to create a Covid 19 tracker using KOR Connect.

Introduction
1. Code Linting &amp; SAST
2. Running a security audit with npm audit
3. Integrity checking for JavaScript (SRI)


How does it work?
4. Validations, Validations, Validations!
5. Minify and obfuscate your Javascript
Conclusion
Javascript is everywhere, It runs inside your browser, astronaut spacesuit, and most developers use it as a client-side and server-side programming language to allow them to create interactive web pages.
Javascript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language with first-class functions.
In addition, the Javascript ecosystem relies heavily on third-party libraries;

The tl;dr is:
# read the YubiKey
echo &quot;Press your YubiKey&quot;
read -rs YUBIKEY

A YubiKey is a device made by Yubico intended as a form of MFA.
Generally, it&#x27;s a USB device that is used to obtain access to sensitive resources.
Yubico provides a cli, ykman, for the YubiKey. The intention of ykman is to allow IT administrators to configure YubiKeys for their organizations. 
I thought that it would be cool to have some shell scripts around for common APIs within my organization, but some of these require a credential generated from my YubiKey. My logic was that perhaps ykman could script the YubiKey credential generation for me.
I googled for an hour and only came up with a couple discussions about this. Unfortunately, one of them held some bad news:
I don&#x27;t think there is a way to programmatically get a YubiOTP from the YubiKey
from discussion on ykman issue 400
The solution is a quick-and-dirty &quot;silent read&quot; from the terminal:
# read the YubiKey
echo &quot;Press your YubiKey&quot;
read -rs YUBIKEY
echo &quot;Thank you&quot;

I thought I&#x27;d post that in case someone else goes searching for it in the future.</span>

                    <span>Displaying the app version automatically pulled from package.json is a great way to ask clients and users to verify what version they are using.  It is also helpful to include it in error logging.  In previous versions of Angular it was as easy as doing this inside your environment.ts files:
import { version } from &#x27;../../package.json&#x27;;

However in Angular 12 you get an error:
Error: Should not import the named export &#x27;version&#x27; (imported as &#x27;version&#x27;) from default-exporting module (only default export is available soon)
export const environment &#x3D; {
  ...
  VERSION: require(&#x27;../../package.json&#x27;).version,
};

And there is a good chance you will need to add this to your tsconfig.app.json:

Hi All
I am an avid user of ZEN for over 10 years now and it works for me.

But it seems that Intersystems are no longer actively developing it (or ZEN Mojo), the only published reference to this¬† is¬†here
As an aside, Intersystems makes fine products (I have been using the technology for 35 years) and has great support BUT they are not good at being open with their product road map/retirement plans.¬† This is very embarrassing¬† to me when talking with my end user clients.


So I am looking at how to replace ZEN - this is not a short term project, at one client I have over 800 ZEN pages.

And it&#x27;s such a shame as ZEN works and, most importantly, I and the team know how to make it &quot;sing and dance&quot;.
I work in back office business apps so do not need some of the fancy stuff ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Flexbox can help you simplify the process of creating both basic and advanced layouts.
