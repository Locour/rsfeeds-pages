                    <span>In this part of the tutorial I’m going to be making a mock service to house all my animal details. In the previous part of the mock data series I made a second set of classes for animals and identified the need to move them out to a single location.
Here is where the magic happens with this process. When I’ve identified duplicated data and move it to a central location not only does my code become more consistent and simplified but it is also more maintainable.
It is true that I am often working in prototype code so it really doesn’t “matter” that I have some duplication going on. Or even that the code isn’t maintainable because it’s all a prototype right now anyway.
I’m always pushing to make my code easier to fold into the process. I don’t want to spend time/effort/energy on writing the …</span>

                    <span>Welcome to the Angular 11 Tutorial Course, specially designed for beginners and busy developers. 
I create simple step-by-step tutorials which cover the version of Angular 2 to the latest Angular 11.
Angular is a client-side TypeScript based framework which is used to create dynamic web applications. 
-Support TypeScript
Components and services both are simply classes with decorators that mark their types and provide metadata which guide Angular to do things.
Every Angular application always has at least one component known as root component that connects a page hierarchy with page DOM. Each component defines a class that contains application data and logic, and is associated with an HTML template that defines a view to be displayed in a target environment.

Configure Auth0
Install the Auth0 Angular SDK
Add Login to Your Application
Add Logout to Your Application
Show User Profile Information
At the point when you pursued Auth0, another application was made for you, or you might have made another one. You will require a few insights concerning that application to speak with Auth0. You can get these subtleties from the &quot;Application Settings&quot; area in the Auth0 dashboard.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a developer using mostly angular.js. My angular2+ experience is mostly some studying or courses from time to time. Therefore - I&#x27;m not using angular-cli on a daily basis, and I seems to upgrade node &amp; npm more often I generate a new angular2+ project.
The official doc, tells me to do as follow:
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
$ ng new my-project

I&#x27;m a bit bothered by this, because:
I&#x27;m not going to use that much before switching to the newer npm version
I don&#x27;t want to thing about any possible ways global version of angular cli would collide with local versions installed in projects
Besides, I really like the light-weight approach frameworks like Next.js or NuxtJS are allowing you to just start playing with their code generator.
Luckily, there is this alternative way of generating angular project:
$ npx -p @angular/cli ng my-project

as you can see it here:
it does the job:

Even though angular documentation seems to assume you have no reason of trying out their framework, unless you it&#x27;s your job and you need all the tooling all the time (maybe they are right about it); here we have an easier way of running their generator command, without turning our environment into angular-shop.</span>

                    <span>Tomty is a Raku test framework with focus on devops tasks. Tomty allows one to write test scenarios on Bash (and only) and orchestrate them using Raku.
In this post I am going to give a quick introduction into Tomty.
Tomty is installed as Raku module, using zef - Raku package manager:
zef install --/test https://github.com/melezhik/Sparrow6.git
zef install --/test https://github.com/melezhik/Tomty.git 

We need bleeding edge version of Tomty and Sparrow (dependency for Tomty) to get an access to all the features mentioned in this post.
Working with Tomty requires some initialization. First of all we need to create a working directory for tests and initialize it. Optionally we can install Bash completion for tomty - Tomty cli application:

OK everyone, it&#x27;s time for the fourth and final installment of the DevOps Detour series. We&#x27;re already several months out from when these events actually took place, but nonetheless, I want to close out this series.
Today, the matter concerning my existence is how one goes about making their Docker images more secure — and the fallout from trying to do that.
The third part of the DevOps Detour was all concerned with upgrading cert-manager and ingress-nginx, and how I thought the cert-manager upgrade would take forever when it ended up being the easy one of the two.
We&#x27;re staying on the theme of &quot;upgrading&quot; today, but just shifting it slightly from upgrading services to upgrading how we handle images themselves. The topics of today are distroless images, …</span>

                    <span>Alright now with everything we&#x27;ve learned so far, let&#x27;s apply to another problem.



Many content management sites (CMS) have the titles of a post added to part of the URL for simple bookmarking purposes. For example, if you write a Medium post titled Stop Using Reduce, it&#x27;s likely the URL would have some form of the title string in it (.../stop-using-reduce).
Let&#x27;s Fill in the urlSlug function so it converts a string title and returns the hyphenated version for the URL.
The input is a string with spaces and title-cased words
The output is a string with the spaces between words replaced by a hyphen (-)
The output should be all lower-cased letters
The output should not have any spaces




// Only change code below this line
function urlSlug(title) {


}
// Only change code above this line

Answer:




function urlSlug(title) {
return title
    .toLowerCase()
    .split(&quot; &quot;)
    .filter(str &#x3D;&gt; str !&#x3D; &quot;&quot;) // &lt;-- basically saying if the str being passed is not equal to an empty string return that str
    .join(&quot;-&quot;)

}

console.log(urlSlug(&quot; Winter Is Coming&quot;))

urlSlug(&quot; Winter Is  Coming&quot;) returns the string winter-is-coming</span>

                    <span>vim (aka Vi IMproved) is a highly efficient text editor that has inspired other editors like it, most notably MacVim (which I will refer to as vim from here on) and gVim.
You see, I use a code editor called Vim, which is sort of like an operating system for writing code.  I know it might seem bizarre, but there&#x27;s a method to my madness:  Vim lets me write code very quickly and with very little effort. It&#x27;s a great way of working that I wake up excited to do every day.  

Vim is one of the most popular text editors, which is why you’re either using it or wondering why you should be using it. But if you’re not a programmer, why should you care?
It&#x27;s a matter of preference, but 
You don’t have to open vim to write code
If you’re like us, you don’t want to have to switch between your text editor and your terminal while you write your code.
You can use it over an SSH connection
This is a big plus. With a few commands you&#x27;re inanother computer and can edit right away
It works on all operating systems
Even the most obsecure operating systems support vim. Like some router with busybox installed
It&#x27;s completely controlled by key presses
You don&#x27;t need to use the mouse, vim is controlled by key presses. However if you like clicking around, there&#x27;s gvim.
Vim does have a steep learning curve, but you can practice vim on sites like vim.is</span>

Lets talk about, if you want to experience a flavor of linux, what are the different ways to do so.
This might seem very odd, but of course, docker will let you experience the CLI version for a linux, say Fedora / Ubuntu / Debian / Alpine. You can use these OS images to build your application. Or just experience it in the CLI.
Similar to docker, you can launch OS instance in environment provided by the cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP, MS Azure etc. Here also, you get access to the OS via the CLI only.

                    <span>When building backend of a web application, we often need to call APIs of remote servers. It is not a big deal when we have to make just one or two API calls per requests. But most of the time we have to make two or more API calls depending on the requests. That&#x27;s when problem occurs. Because the more API calls you make, the longer it will need to serve the data.
Let&#x27;s assume you have to handle a request which requires five API calls. You make five API calls one by one. When all of the data is available, you clean, format and merge them and send it to the frontend. Let&#x27;s say it takes six seconds to get data from all of the API calls. Six seconds may seem feasible but it&#x27;s always better to make things efficient and faster whenever possible. 
So, to serve the request faster we can make all t…</span>

So, I decided to write an article to share the configuration that I use on my Fastify projects. The goal is to give the reader some starting point for his app, this is not the 100% correct solution for all the projects, but a solution which in my case was correct.

Vercel



express to nodejs app.



index.js in root source.



./api folder or you can rename anything which you like.



Here is an example for manage product from ./api/product.


After testing is 👌. Commit them to git to see something awesome.


Because Vercel just supports API from Framework JS as NEXT.JS, Nuxt.JS,... So if we develop a standalone application we need to configure or tell the server of Vercel how is it work by vercel.json file.
vercel.json file to root source.



Commit it to GitHub and make sure version is 2 - this is required from Vercel.

Thanks for reading.

                    <span>이 포스트는 TypeScript - Modules를 번역 및 학습한 내용입니다.
   
ECMAScript 2015(ES6)에 추가된 모듈 기능을 TypeScript에서도 똑같이 사용 할 수 있다. 모듈은 자신만의 스코프를 가지고 있으며, 모듈 내부에 선언된 변수, 함수, 클래스 등은 export 되지 않는 한 외부에서 접근 할 수 없다.
export된 모듈은 다른 모듈에서  import 키워드를 통해 불러올 수 있다. 이를 가능하게 하는 것은 모듈 로더이다. 모듈 로더는 런타임에 import된 모듈(디펜던시)의 위치를 확인한다. 자바스크립트에서 사용되는 모듈 로더의 종류는 크게 두 가지이다.
CommonJS 모듈을 위한 Node.js의 로더
AMD 모듈을 위한 RequireJS 로더
import, 혹은 export 키워드를 포함한 파일은 모듈로 처리된다. 그 외(import, export 키워드가 없는 파일)는 일반 스크립트(글로벌 스코프를 공유하는)로 처리된다.
   
export 키워드를 사용하면, 선언된 모든 식별자(변수, 함수, 클래스, 타입, 인터페이스 등)를 export 할 수 있다.
// StringValidator.ts
export interface StringValidator {
  isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;
}

// ZipCodeValidator.ts
import { StringValidator } from &#x27;./StringValidator&#x27;;

Accept header, either I&#x27;m.
This short article will show how simple to add validation and matching to your HTTP router independently to the router and framework you use.
Accept header is a simple list of mime types (application/json, text/html, etc.) or wildcard rules (*/*, application/*, etc.) that a client supports.
Accept header, the client expects to respond with one of the matched mime types from the header.
This header also supports additional parameters that a client can provide per a mime type.
The main parameter is quality q, that defines order of rules to choose the best option for a client, for example: */*;q&#x3D;0.1, application/json; q&#x3D;1, application/xml; q&#x3D;0.8.…</span>

The kube-bench is an open-source tool that checks whether Kubernetes is deployed securely by running the CIS benchmark for Kubernetes checks. It&#x27;s written as a Go application and also distributed as a container. Each test is defined in the YAML and also supports JSON-format output that can be used to evolve along wiht Kubernetes and to integrate with automaton tools.
The CIS Kubernetes Benchmark is scoped for implementations managing both the control plane, which includes etcd, API server, controller, scheduler, and the data plane, which is made up of one or more nodes or EC2 instances.

                    <span>In this part of the tutorial I’m going to be making a mock service to house all my animal details. In the previous part of the mock data series I made a second set of classes for animals and identified the need to move them out to a single location.
Here is where the magic happens with this process. When I’ve identified duplicated data and move it to a central location not only does my code become more consistent and simplified but it is also more maintainable.
It is true that I am often working in prototype code so it really doesn’t “matter” that I have some duplication going on. Or even that the code isn’t maintainable because it’s all a prototype right now anyway.
I’m always pushing to make my code easier to fold into the process. I don’t want to spend time/effort/energy on writing the …</span>

I like Pikaday. This is because it is framework independent and great browser compatibility (includes IE7!).
Pikaday - GitHub
But it can only select the date. And this time i want to choose the month.
For Chrome and Edge or some other browsers, I can use &quot;input type&#x3D;&quot;month&quot;&quot;.

input type&#x3D;&quot;month&quot; - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN
But because it can&#x27;t be used in all modern browsers, and I don&#x27;t like its selecting years design, I don&#x27;t want to use it.
Because I only could find month pickers for jQuery, React, and etc, I will try creating it.
In this sample, I don&#x27;t care about old browsers.

                    <span>I&#x27;m working on an app that uses a Laravel REST API on the back-end and Vue.js 3 with Typescript on the front-end. My issue was keeping the session after a new request. I got it working with Postman, but it took me a while to figure out why it wasn&#x27;t working with Vue.js. I didn&#x27;t find much info on the web (maybe my search queries were poor) and what I found was  mostly about using Laravel Passport or Sanctum, but that&#x27;s used with authentication and not necessary for my app. The session id gets stored in a cookie, but I didn&#x27;t know in the beginning that Laravel actually handles setting the cookie for you when things are set up properly. These are the steps taken that ended up working.

                    <span>이 포스트는 TypeScript - Modules를 번역 및 학습한 내용입니다.
   
ECMAScript 2015(ES6)에 추가된 모듈 기능을 TypeScript에서도 똑같이 사용 할 수 있다. 모듈은 자신만의 스코프를 가지고 있으며, 모듈 내부에 선언된 변수, 함수, 클래스 등은 export 되지 않는 한 외부에서 접근 할 수 없다.
export된 모듈은 다른 모듈에서  import 키워드를 통해 불러올 수 있다. 이를 가능하게 하는 것은 모듈 로더이다. 모듈 로더는 런타임에 import된 모듈(디펜던시)의 위치를 확인한다. 자바스크립트에서 사용되는 모듈 로더의 종류는 크게 두 가지이다.
CommonJS 모듈을 위한 Node.js의 로더
AMD 모듈을 위한 RequireJS 로더
import, 혹은 export 키워드를 포함한 파일은 모듈로 처리된다. 그 외(import, export 키워드가 없는 파일)는 일반 스크립트(글로벌 스코프를 공유하는)로 처리된다.
   
export 키워드를 사용하면, 선언된 모든 식별자(변수, 함수, 클래스, 타입, 인터페이스 등)를 export 할 수 있다.

  isAcceptable(s: string): boolean;

                    <span>A useful practice when you work with a specific stack, is to create generic stuff for this stack. This is the fundamental principle of a framework, library, package, etc.
With generic and reusable code, your project will start faster. All that&#x27;s left is to write the business rules part of your project.
I work with React to build front end. As languages, I use Javascript or Typescript. I prefer Typescript, but at work, sometime you have no choices.
As CSS framework, my preference goes to Bulma.
It&#x27;s simple, easy to tweak or override and especially, it contains no Javascript or Jquery, only HTML and CSS rules.
All I expect from a CSS framework.
I dislike make the same thing again and again. It&#x27;s useless and repetitive tasks create bugs.
Some of basic components stays the same on all projects
That&#x27;s why I create a NPM package called react-components.
It&#x27;s a library of basic components made with Bulma and React Typescript.
The objectives :
Learn how to create and publish a package.
Learn more about open source not by participating but by being at the origin of a (very small) project.
Learn how to manage advice and criticism about my project to progress as a developer.
Have basics components available immediately.
Nowadays, This project is under development and contains lots of beginner mistakes.
I work on it as a side project, between all my side projects, so it&#x27;s progressing very slowly.
I think to make more posts about this work and all the challenges I meet.
If you want know more about this project or how to contribute, don&#x27;t be shy. Comments and DM on Twitter are open.</span>

                    <span>In this article, I’ll share 10 of the JavaScript tips, tricks, and best practices that I follow and found useful.
This is one of the most used operators when I have to deal with large numbers. When using a separator (with just an _) in number it looks better than an unseparated number.
For example:
let number &#x3D; 98234567

to ⬇
let number &#x3D; 98_234_567

And it works for any other numeric base as well:
const binary &#x3D; 0b1000_0101;
const hex &#x3D; 0x12_34_56_78;

The use of semi-colons for line termination is a good practice. You won’t be warned if you forget it, because in most cases it will be inserted by the JavaScript parser but relying on Automatic Semicolon Insertion(ASI) is not encouraged.
This is even included in Google’s, Airbnb’s, and jQuery’s Javascript style guides.

                    <span>If you are a frontend developer, it&#x27;s obvious about the time and thoughts you take to fix on a perfect icon for your website. You have to navigate to websites like Flaticon, Font Awesome, Material Icons etc., find suitable icons, download the SVG or copy the font  and finally need to include the corresponding libraries to your code base. Reducing this hassle and the bundle size associated with importing external packages was the main inspiration behind this VS Code extension.
With Get-Svg-Icons extension, you no longer have to navigate to other websites to choose your icon, everything comes handy on VS code itself. A side panel with customizable icons and the inline icon suggestions on vscode editor makes the process easy and thus increase productivity of developers.  
Side Panel with around 1300+ icons
Users can search for the icon-name (or tags associated with it) and choose the desired icon
On clicking on the icon, corresponding svg code will be inserted at the last active position on the code editor
Users can change the height and width of the svg directly from the side panel

Type &quot;icon-&quot; (without quotes) to start auto-completing icons. If the icon preview is not showing up (as shown in the GIF below), press Ctrl+Space (default hotkey) or press the  &quot;&gt;&quot; icon to expand the details view.
An inline replacement of the selected icon with its svg will be done.

On hovering over the svg code (class name) , you can preview the icon of the corresponding svg snippet

                    <span>This article talks about an efficient way to implement auto-complete feature using Angular concepts. The key components used in this demonstration are as follows:
Angular Material (v12) Autocomplete module.
RxJS for action and data binding.
Angular in-memory-web-api for REST services (Refer to in-memory-web-api).
 

 

 




Let us now see how we go about it:
The front-end consists of an angular autocomplete module. The input event taps the user&#x27;s keystrokes and emits a new value into an action subject.

AutocompleteService class.

The action BehaviorSubject starts with an empty string. The action$ is an observable built out of this subject.

GET request. Since this is a higher-order observable (i.e., an observable returning an observable), we make use of one of the higher order functions like switchMap.

switchMap (and not other higher order functions like concatMap or mergeMap)? The reason is: switchMap unsubscribes from the previous observable once a new value is emitted by the parent observable.
What this means is - as soon as the user types in another letter or removes a letter, there is simply no need to subscribe and execute the rest call for the previous values. The user is only interested to see the results of the search according to his/her current input. And switchMap does this automatically, and thus gets rid of unwanted rest calls.
We can also get additional control on when to fire the rest service depending on the length of the user&#x27;s input. For example, in this demo, I fire the rest call only when the user has entered at least 2 characters. If not, then I return an observable of empty array (using of([])).
 


  
  
  Back to the Component:


We tap onto the above observable and use async pipe to subscribe to it. Since we are completely using observables, we can also use the OnPush change-detection-strategy.

By using this AMI we can quickly create as many instance we want 
Creating your own custom AMI
For creating custom AMI you need to have your own instance running.
If you don&#x27;t know how to create a instance please check this article below

After you have instance go to instances select your instance click on Actions and click on Image and Templates and select Create Image and enter create image
Enter your image name



Go to AMI section which is present in the side nav bar


Here you can find your AMIs



Once the AMI is available go to instances click on launch instance




Now here in choose AMI section select My AMIs




You can see your own custom created AMI here 




Select it and follow the same instructions that we use for creating instance.

In simple words, data can be facts related to any object in consideration. 
A database is a systematic collection of data. 
They support electronic storage and manipulation of data. 
Databases make data management easy.
Here are some popular types of databases.
A distributed database is a type of database that has contributions from the common database and information captured by local computers. 
In this type of database system, the data is not in one place and is distributed at various organizations.
This type of database defines database relationships in the form of tables. 
It is also called Relational DBMS, which is the most popular DBMS type in the market.
Database examples of the RDBMS system include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server databases.

                    <span>Simple is not easy, easy is not simple
Let&#x27;s first get that out of the way. People are often equating easiness with simplicity, but they are very different words.
Simple (vs complex) - from &quot;sim plex&quot;, literally: one-fold (i.e. not braided)


Easy (vs hard) - from &quot;lying at, lie near&quot;; familiar, near to our understanding



Rich Hickey goes more into details about this in his presentation. If you haven&#x27;t already, check it out (I don&#x27;t agree with everything he said, but it&#x27;s a good presentation, definitely worth watching).
Most often, achieving simplicity is the hardest thing to do in software development and usually it requires an enormous experience.
Simplicity is probably the most important aspect of software development. As Edsger Dijkstra put it, &quot;Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability&quot;.
If your design is not simple, the whole thing will eventually become fragile, unreliable and starting to fall apart.
Unfortunately, complexity sells much better and when you combine that with cargo-cult programming and resume driven development, you get the modern web development mess.
The same goes for modern system administration (or devops, if you will) - if you&#x27;ve been working with UNIX long enough, all you need to do is take a look at Kubernetes mess.
I created devsimplicity.com as a simple, wiki-like place, focused mostly on addressing those issues, avoiding complexity traps and as a quick way to find&amp;explore the better/saner alternatives. There&#x27;s still lot of work to do, but it&#x27;s getting better. If you like the idea, follow me on twitter.com/devsimplicity or here for the updates.

                    <span>Probably there are hundred or thousands of articles on how to install Linux but I made this mainly for myself, but maybe you find it useful too.
I will show you how to do it in 5 simple steps. The steps are almost the same for every popular distro.
First of all you will need a pendrive. Without one we can&#x27;t do so much... 
Download a program to create bootable USB drive. There are many programs for that, here are some of them: UNetbootin, Rufus, Etcher, Linux Live USB Creator and there are many more.
Not all of them are for all Operating Systems so you will need to check if they are available for your OS. For example, UNetbootin if for Windows, Linux or Mac OS but Rufus is only for Windows.
Once you picked the program you like, download it and install it in your Operating System.

                    <span>Introduction



I continued the normal path of Windows Vista (Why), Windows 7 (Thank G’d), Windows 8 (Mmmm), 8.1 (Ok, Ok, back to normal), and now Windows 10 (finally). I work with Windows Servers as well; Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012R2, 2016 and even Windows Server 2019.
I know Windows pretty well. I wrote C++ programs that interact with Windows Internals. Even wrote a small filter driver. I’ve installed and configured more Windowses than I could count.
So, following this introduction, you can see why my first thought was to install Docker on Windows.

I asked another team, which had more practice using Docker, what they thought. They threw me away and told me I was being silly, “Docker should be only on Linux”. I asked why? there’s such a nice GUI for Windows..

                    <span>Containers have taken the world by storm. Nowadays, many production environments employ containers in one form or another, running on developers&#x27; workstations, locally hosted servers and/or the cloud.
If you have worked as a developer or administrator in the industry, chances are you&#x27;ve worked with modern container runtimes such as Docker and Kubernetes or at least heard of them. From a high-level perspective, containers are an OS-level abstraction - a stripped down operating system (OS) containing one or more applications (apps) of interest running atop some host in an isolated manner, which provides an extra layer of security compared to running the app(s) directly on the host and enables the app(s) to be executed on different hosts (possibly with different hardware) in a consistent, rep…</span>

                    <span>Lambda layers  were introduced in 2018 for flexibel  code/data sharing  within same or different AWS accounts. AWS Lambda supports multiple environments but here we will talk about only Nodejs. I will describe the whole process of making lambda layers &amp; how to use them in Lambda functions.
So, whenever, we want to use custom code in lambda functions supporting nodejs environment. We write that code in form of  node modules  and to make that code shared through lambda layers, we have to make a build  of those node modules. That build will be uploaded to a  Lambda Layer  and layer can be attached to any lambda function which can ultimately access that code.
In Nodejs supported AWS Lambda environment, lambda layers are usually made for following usecases:

                    <span>It was always a little bit hard to prepare JS code to be reusable through the NPM registry. 
Over time we had a lot of different approaches. We had many different ways to use modular-like code in JavaScript. 
Before 2015 we didn&#x27;t even have official built-in modules standard in JavaScript. So we had to use third-party tools like AMD with, for example, RequireJS or - in Node ecosystem - CommonJS.
With ES6 or ES2015, we&#x27;ve got modules support in JavaScript. Of course, it was a time when all the development progress within browsers or Node was slow. Lately, we&#x27;ve gained momentum, and we are getting updates quite often. It&#x27;s good. But what does that mean for NPM packages creators?
Let&#x27;s imagine an example. I started to think why I even need tools like Babel or Parcel nowadays to create my NPM …</span>

                    <span>Are you interested in creating frameworks? Then read this post carefully.
Let&#x27;s find out what the framework itself is. A framework is a program that combines one or more functions, simplifying the work of a programmer. The framework works in the same programming language in which it was written. (The framework we create for Node.js is written in JavaScript)
Node.js is a runtime program that allows you to use the javascript programming language outside the browser. It contains several modules, such as http and so on. Popular apps created at Node.js: Linkedin, Netflix, Ebay and Uber. The most popular frameworks of this program are Express.js, Telegraf.js and so on. All frameworks written in JS also work in Node.js.

In this article we will implement a very common web use case at Edge. We will implement a leaderboard API without any backend servers, containers or even serverless functions. We will just use edge functions.  Leaderboard will have the following APIs:
  addScore: Adds a score with the player&#x27;s name. This will write the score to the Upstash Redis directly from the Edge functions.

                    <span>What is an Azure function?


Azure Functions is a cloud service available on-demand that provides all the continually updated infrastructure and resources needed to run your applications. You focus on the pieces of code that matter most to you, and Functions handles the rest. Functions provides serverless compute for Azure. You can use Functions to build web APIs, respond to database changes, process IoT streams, manage message queues, and more.





  
  
  What is Azure Key Vault?


Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that allows us to protect cryptographic keys, certificates (and the private keys associated with certificates), and secrets (such as connection strings and passwords) in the cloud.
Because Azure functions are serverless pieces of code, we do not want to put any of our secret…</span>

                    <span>You can get the file here.
It&#x27;s important to warmup before physical activity.
Free hint, don&#x27;t get used to it: XOR cipher was used for this flag&#x27;s encryption with a single byte key.
So we practically need to find the key that was xored. Since its just 1 byte, its easy to bruteforce.
And the flag is always in the format if  ivyctf{...}.
So lets find the key that simply xors to match the first letter i.
In [19]: def get_key(contents):
    ...:     for i in range(256):
    ...:         if ord(contents[0]) ^ i &#x3D;&#x3D; ord(&#x27;i&#x27;):
    ...:             return i
    ...:
    ...:
    ...:
    ...:
    ...:

Above is just a function that gets the content of the file and goes through the value of a byte, 0 to 255.
i.
Once we get the key, we simply xor it with the rest of the file.
In [21]: def crack_flag(contents, key):
    ...:     flag &#x3D; []
    ...:     for ch in contents:
    ...:         flag.append(chr(ord(ch) ^ key))
    ...:     print(&#x27;&#x27;.join(flag))

Once we get our functions right, lets run them.
In [23]: contents &#x3D; open(&#x27;flag.enc&#x27;, &#x27;r&#x27;).read()

In [24]: crack_flag(contents, get_key(contents))

I just want to share with you why I decided to move to WebStorm and why I&#x27;m still using it and maybe you could consider using it too!.
The first reason why I decided to start using WebStorm is because I changed my computer, and as a developer with a lot of work I needed to start coding as fast as I could, so I downloaded VsCode because that was the editor which I used to use, then I realised that I did not have all my plugins that I had in my previous computer (obviously) and I did not even remember their names, it was very frustrating.

The Clean Architecture is an awesome guide for developers who desire to build a clean, structured and maintainable projects. The letter L in SOLID principal allows us to make depended components are easily replaced without touch to the business and the core of systems. For example of the web server where there are many frameworks out there (Expressjs, GraphQL, etc) and the chosen decision depends on the purpose of the business and the context.
In this boilerplate guide scope we will go through how to make the core business immune with the change of the detailed technologies. Let&#x27;s go!

Recently, I started a small Angular application that acts as an installer for a distributed API Gateway application. As part of our testing and quality engineering, we always inspect our web applications. However, we hadn’t done much with static code analysis. It was mostly security dynamic analysis over our client and server communication. Fortify is a product that we have used for this since the company that I work for owns it, and recently they added support for Typescript in their static code analysis. So this was a great opportunity to use it on our Angular project.
Fortify is a product of Micro Focus that allows security scans of applications. Many people are familiar with “WebInspect”, which some people use as a synonym for Fortify.

                    <span>The JS environment teems with libraries and frameworks. However, with diverse options comes confusion along the way. It is imperative to choose the correct form of technology that helps you achieve what you want and helps in achieving your aim. A wrong decision can eat your time and leave your project in shambles. 
Why Choose Angular For Web Development? Let us look into some of the reasons for choosing Angular for your next project and how it will impact your business.
Parented by Google
Fulfills the Requirements
Purposefully informative
Checks and balances
The first impression is the last
using Angular CLI. All the components have predefined styles which help in the fast delivery of the service. Angular Material documentation is replete with the necessary examples which are required.
Package in itself
SPAs
Module Based
Friendly user-experience
Concluding to the final question- is it still relevant given that it has been here for a decade Yes! Absolutely! It is up-to-date and quite efficient in helping you build modern products. It is supported, powered, and parented by Google, and that in itself makes Angular&#x27;s future bright. However, depending upon your project, the choice of the framework should be taken judiciously. The angular ecosystem is vast and continues to bring a lot to the table. The core team releases biannual versions, making it always excitable for the next updated version.</span>

It&#x27;s rare to see an innovation that actually tackles more issues then it&#x27;s introducing. One of those rare occasions seems to be developing right now - the move towards JAM stack - which is an umbrella term for many technologies, that used together creates a different approach to put content online.
If I were to build a blog, or podcast website I would go with following technologies:
github or gitlab for hosting the repository
netlify for hosting the website itself, and building the code
next.js or other JAM stack framework to build my code upon

For people who use Jupyter notebooks for development and testing quite often, you’re probably habituated to copying and pasting code around all the time.
Deleting test snippets, using a different IDE to compile and test your code again, and developing an API is just a few of the time-consuming tasks an ML developer is used to.
Wouldn’t it be great if we could automate the drudgery of boilerplate code needed to build an API project?** **Here we will train an emotion recognition model in a Jupyter Notebook and convert it into a Flask API project with absolutely no extra code!

                    <span>In Windows, simple and easy to install python  virtual environment using pip command and we are good to go ...


Here, how anyone can do it.
Open Command prompt or Powershell 
pip install --upgrade pip
pip3 install virtualenvwrapper-win

Remember :- Python.3x - uses pip3 and Python.2x - uses pip
Creating, working and deleting specific python virtual environment
mkvirtual env1
deactivate

workon env1
pip3 install flask
decativate

rmvirtualenv env1

This is like, we can create multiple python virtual environment in C Drive at specific location and can be accessable it from anywhere, if we working on any project or doing something.
Screenshot - cmd

venv for certain task


Let&#x27;s do it.
Open bash ( Terminal )

if not installed, we can install now
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip3
pip3 install --upgrade pip3

Then installing virtual environment
sudo pip3 install virtualenvwrapper
sudo pip3 install virtualenvwrapper-win

Creating any folder in home directory, like
mkdir pyenvs

Making changes to the .bashrc file
sudo nano ~/.bashrc

You will see like this screen

Scroll down (or use Down key ) till the end, then Copy and Paste these below script but find the &quot;Your_user_name&quot; by command uname -r and  version of python as python3.7, python3.8 and python3.9 etc using which python3.
For example: In my case,
&#x27;/home/ajay/pyens&#x27;
&#x27;/usr/bin/python3.9&#x27;





export WORKON_HOME&#x3D;&#x27;/home/Your_user_name/pyens&#x27;
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON&#x3D;&#x27;/usr/bin/python3.x&#x27;
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

Ctrl+S (save) and Ctrl+X (moving out from the file)
And creating python virtual environment either single or multiple times is same as like in windows.
bash ( Terminal )


Screenshot - bash

Check out pypi virtualenvwrapper-win on python pypi packages

Introduction


Hello, and welcome to this week&#x27;s security review. I am your host Habdul Hazeez.
In this week&#x27;s review, we&#x27;ll look at some really scary news, like seriously scary, from printers going AWOL to Artificial Intelligence systems being fooled into identifying someone else as Elon Musk and ATM being hacked by .... wait for it....waving a phone 🤤.
I told you it was scary 😨.

NFC flaws let researchers hack an ATM by waving a phone


NFC is short for Near Field Communications, and like all tech developed by man, it can be manipulated and abused.
In this scenario, security researchers used it to hack an Automated Teller Machine popularly known as an ATM.

                    <span>O que é integridade de sub-recursos?


SRI é uma especificação da W3C que permite aos desenvolvedores web garantir que os recursos hospedados em servidores de terceiros não foram adulterados. Seu uso é recomendado como boa prática, sempre que as bibliotecas são carregadas de uma fonte de terceiro.

                    <span>🛡 Mobile security threats are increasing as more organizations seek to increase mobility. Here’s how to protect your business from the most common mobile attacks.



  
  
  
Mobile initiatives are a top priority for many organizations these days because research shows that increases in mobility help enterprises improve operations and productivity.
However, increases in organizational mobility typically result in an increase in the number of mobile devices that are accessing your systems from a remote location. And for your security teams, this means a growing variety of endpoints and threats they need to secure in order to protect your organization from a data breach.
As in the past, the most common threats to mobile security include mobile malware. However, as Verizon’s 2020 Mobile Secu…</span>

This works really well when you are working to fold a new user experience into an existing system.

                    <span>Organizations continuously seek new approaches to build growth opportunities and reduce marketing time. One can increase their organization’s efficiency and agility by application or software modernization. Application modernization is a gateway to continuously improve your organization by refactoring a monolithic application into a set of independently developed, managed and deployed microservices.
Although you can use monolithic applications for a few use cases, modern features usually don’t work in an application based on monolithic architecture. Monolithic applications can become large and unmanageable that require coordination and effort from multiple teams, even if a small change is needed.
That’s why by choosing microservices you can decentralize your data stores and promote polyglo…</span>

--
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine

Once this is done, let&#x27;s quickly check if SSR is working as per our expectation.
npm run build:ssr &amp;&amp; npm run serve:ssr

Node server fires up on port 4000 and I check for my webpage&#x27;s source.
view-source:http://localhost:4000/


ng add @angular/pwa

No extra configurations so far, and that&#x27;s how it will be. Let&#x27;s build our universal application once again and serve it on localhost:4000.
But wait!!! Now when I view my webpage source on the browser, I get this:

So does this mean that my SSR is broken?
Nope! My SSR is perfectly fine :-) Let&#x27;s run a quick check to prove this. Open up POSTMAN and run a GET request against http://localhost:4000. And voila! I see my server-side-rendered page once again!

--
index.html is now cached by service-worker at the browser. The browser does not need to wait for the server to render the content any more, and it simply serves the cached version, and Angular takes over thereafter, like a normal SPA. Open up ngsw-config.json and verify that index.html is one of the cached resources.

Note (and a small exercise): If you remove index.html from ngsw-config.json and re-build your universal, you would see that the server-rendered content is back on your browser source, since the HTML is now no longer being cached!

Modern employees require more flexibility than their previous counterparts. 
54% of employees say they’d rather shift to a career that offers them more flexibility. In other words, organizations are more likely to retain employees if they offer flexible work arrangements.
But shifting from in-person work to remote work comes with a full host of changes (and something to keep in mind when starting a business). The most crucial one? Making sure your remote team is set up to work safely and securely. 
But before we touch on 10 tips to improve your remote team’s security, let’s take a look at the importance of safe and secure remote working.

                    <span>Angular is a powerful feature-rich platform that you can use to create all kinds of single-page apps, ranging from simple sites to more intricate ones. With it, you can build efficient native, web, and mobile apps with a wide range of tools and libraries it integrates. However, there are still ways apps built with it can be improved. For example, using Angular Universal, you can render your apps server-side to speed up page loads and improve SEO and performance.
Server-side rendering involves converting an app to HTML on a server. When you send a request for a particular path to the server, it returns an entirely static HTML page as a response. No additional requests need to be made to populate the page with data and resources as it is all contained in the response. The page appears almost…</span>

Grayscale release, also known as canary release.
The term &quot;canary&quot; stems from the tradition of coal miners bringing caged canaries into mines. Miners use canaries to detect the concentration of carbon monoxide in the mine. The canaries would be poisoned by high concentration of carbon monoxide, in this case miners should evacute immediately. - DevOps Practice Guide
When we use &quot;grayscale&quot; or &quot;canary&quot; in software development. It refers to a small number of users&#x27; test before official release. So the problems can be detected earlier to prevent them from affecting most users.

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>
