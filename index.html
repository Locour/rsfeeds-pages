                    <span>How do I calculate correlation using R programming??


To calculate correlation between two data sets is quite easy all you need is to make use of cor() function and insert the parameters xand y. 
What is the correlation between X and Y if y &#x3D; (100,94,150,160,180), and x &#x3D; (23,21,32,40,45).
y&#x3D;c(100,94,150,160,180)
x &#x3D;c(23,21,32,40,45)
cor(x,y)

&gt; y&#x3D;c(100,94,150,160,180)
&gt; x &#x3D;c(23,21,32,40,45)
&gt; cor(x,y)

*ngIf and *ngFor will remove elements from the DOM. There isn’t a CSS solution for animating a non-existing element in the DOM. But Angular provides us with a simple solution.
For purposes of brevity, wherever I refer to *ngIf it is equally applicable to *ngFor. The complete, working code can be downloaded here.
Let’s start with the default application generated by the CLI and just modify the nice Angular logo in and out of the view based on a button we add.
ng new ngifAnimation

You won’t need routing and can select SCSS for the styling.
Let’s add the button we want to use to toggle our *ngIf on the image. Open app.component.html and add a simple button: (this is the default HTML)

The advantage of Ionic is that if you have knowlegde of some Web Development Framework (e.g.: Angular, React, Vue or pure Javascript), then you can start creating Cross-Platform Mobile Apps right away. This means a reduced learning curve and increased productivity.
My goals in this article are:
Set up a project using Ionic 4 and Angular;
Integrate Google Maps into the project;
Exercise some Maps features like centering, maps inputs and outputs;
The basic dependencies to start your project are: Node.js and Angular. If you do not have Node.js, go here. If you do not have Angular installed, go here. After installing both, you need to install Ionic. Just type:
npm install -g @ionic/cli

Terraform is an incredible resource to turn any API into declarative, configurable code with Hashicorp&#x27;s HCL language. However, the world is often at your fingertips when creating cloud resources with Terraform. Frequently, an HCL codebase is run through a CI/CD pipeline, and without proper checks or human involvement, a developer can destroy or change critical resources in production environments.
Insert Conftest! As they state in their GitHub description, Conftest tests against structured configuration data using the Open Policy Agent Rego query language. In the case of Terraform, this means we&#x27;re actually running unit tests against sample JSON and actual tests against the Terraform state JSON.

                    <span>During customer interviews, while I was building OpsDrill, I was shocked by something. Very talented DevOps folks were having a hard time learning Kubernetes.
“I’ve been dragging my feet on learning”
“I’ve started and given up 3 times”
“I don’t know where to start, afraid it will mess up my laptop”
“It’s overwhelming”
I was relieved to hear this as I also found it intimidating.
There is a lot of great free tutorials out there, but some of it feels like jumping straight into “Kubernetes 301: PhD in Containerology”.
(Kubernetes the Hard Way I’m looking at you. An amazing resource, but a very steep on-ramp for busy DevOps folks.)
In the past I’ve built games for learning as well as spaced repetition apps for helping to memorize materials. Would you be interested in

Michael made the comment that the term Devops has been overused and that no one really knows what Devops means anymore.  I do believe he has a point, but I&#x27;d like to set the record straight.
You see, I am a Devops engineer.  I know what Devops means to me.  Even though they have once again given me the Devops job title; automation engineer would work just as well.  To me Devops is about a philosophy more than a job title or magic bullet.  It is important that everyone understands what role a &quot;Devops Engineer&quot; plays at a company.

                    <span>Microsoft went open-source with the .NET framework on 27 June 2016, when it released .NET Core 1. Miguel de Icaza described .NET Core as a “redesigned version of .NET that is based on the simplified version of the class libraries.” And Microsoft’s .NET project manager, Immo Landwerth explained that .NET Core will be “the foundation of all future .NET platforms” because of its cross-platform support.
The next major release of .NET Core was .NET 5.0. This followed .NET Core 3.1. Microsoft named this release .NET 5.0 instead of .NET Core 4.0 for two reasons. Firstly, it was to avoid confusion with the .NET Framework 4.x. Secondly, it was to emphasize that this is the immediate implementation of .NET. Hence, “Core” was dropped from the name.

Jenkins’ support for plugins helps automate nearly every task and set up robust continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines. 
Jenkins provides logs for every Job it executes. These logs offer detailed records related to a Job, such as a build name and number, time for completion, build status, and other information that help analyze the results of running the Job. A typical large-scale implementation of Jenkins in a multi-node environment with multiple pipelines generates tons of logs, making it challenging to identify errors and analyze their root cause(s) whenever there’s a failure.

                    <span>What is an Azure DevOps Personal Access Token (PAT)?


A personal access token (PAT) is used as an alternative to using a password to authenticate into Azure DevOps. When you&#x27;re working with third-party tools, APIs or the command line that don&#x27;t support Microsoft or Azure AD accounts or you don&#x27;t want to provide your primary credentials to the tool, you can make use of PATs.
PATs are easy to create when you need them and easy to revoke when you don’t.

When creating a new PAT you can select the organization where you want to use the token, and then choose a lifespan for your token. Say for example making it only active and usable for a period of 30 days. A PATs lifetime can be extended if needed, but cannot be longer than the maximum period of 1 year. You can also specify granular permissi…</span>

When learning a new technology, I prefer to make multiple small projects focused on different concepts as opposed to cramming everything into one giga app.
I come from an Angular background where it&#x27;s possible to create multiple projects using a single, root package.json; a single node_modules folder is shared across all the various projects under that Angular app.
A few days ago, I renewed my efforts to learn React and immediately ran into a major hurdle... the node_modules folder, or rather a growing hydra of node_modules folders.

                    <span>GraphQL is a popular and powerful way to build your APIs and power your website; we use it for most of our APIs at Anvil. One of the best things about GraphQL is that it provides an Introspection Query capability which allows users to explore and learn about what&#x27;s possible in a given API. In that way, GraphQL is &quot;self-documenting&quot;. Some great tools like Playground and Anvil&#x27;s own SpectaQL leverage the Introspection Query.
Overall, the Introspection Query is a great thing, but there is one major downside: everything in your GraphQL schema will be visible to the world. Chances are your schema contains some Types, Fields, Queries, Mutations, etc, that you do not want the world to see or know about. Shutting down your Introspetion Query is one way to keep things private, but then your users c…</span>

                    <span>At Mastering JS, we love async/await. You might even say we wrote the book on async/await. Here&#x27;s 5 design patterns we use regularly.
forEach()


Do not use an async callback with forEach(). In general, the way to simulate forEach() with async functions is to use await Promise.all([arr.map(callback)])
const values &#x3D; [10, 50, 100];

// Do this:
await Promise.all(values.map(async v &#x3D;&gt; {
  await new Promise(resolve &#x3D;&gt; setTimeout(resolve, v));
  console.log(&#x27;Slept for&#x27;, v, &#x27;ms&#x27;);
}));

// Not this:
values.forEach(async v &#x3D;&gt; {
  await new Promise(resolve &#x3D;&gt; setTimeout(resolve, v));
  console.log(&#x27;Slept for&#x27;, v, &#x27;ms&#x27;);
});

return await


Async/await works with try/catch... almost. There&#x27;s a gotcha. If you await on a promise that rejects, JavaScript throws an error that you can catch. But if you…</span>

                    <span>JavaScript is a single threaded language so how does it handle processes that require multi threads?
LETS FIND OUT
 Why do people say JS isn&#x27;t a stand alone language? 


The first thing that comes to our mind is JS needs an environment to run (node or browser), so we call it dependent language.
So basically JS is a single threaded language so how can it perform api or any processes that require another thread? 
IT CAN&#x27;T 
But when its run on browser or node environment, it takes help of something called event loop. 
 What is event loop?  

Before we get into the understanding of event loop. It&#x27;s ideal to understand how call stack works. (will make another blog on call stack or please refer to another blog on call stack). 
Any process that is async goes into the call stack. It is directly thrown into the event loop and new call stack is formed to call the next process. 
What happens in the event loop?
The event loop is something that is at core done by c++ and c to do the non-blocking I/O operations that couldn&#x27;t be done with vanilla JS. 
It would be easier to understand doing it with an example. 
Let&#x27;s take the most basic function of asynchronous call which is setTimeout().
Step 1: 

Step 2: Since setTimeout is an async call it gets put in the event loop immediately. 

Step 3: Now the call stack looks for the next process while the setTimeout() process is happening in the event loop. This is what they call async programming. Doing multiple tasks at the same time. 
Once the process in the event loop is done. It goes to the event queue so that the call stack can pick it up once there are no more processes left for the call stack to read. 

Once no more processes are left for the call stack, the event queue then pushes the call backs to the call stack so that the script can finally end.</span>

                    <span>Reverse Shells



  
  
  How do reverse shells work?


To make a connection to a typical remote shell, a machine controlled by the attacker connects to the remote network host and it requests a shell connection.
blind shell
But what if the remote host is not directly accessible, like it has public IP or is protected by a firewall?
In this situation reverse shells maybe shouldn&#x27;t be used, where the target machine initiates connection to the listening network host a shell is now established.
To start you need a listener process on their system to listen the reverse shell connections incoming to their IP address, Eg, 12.12.12.12
nc -lvnp 7070

The netcat listener will listen at port 7070. An attacker needs to execute the code to the listener. Many reverse shells needs programming langs

                    <span>Python is a great programming language, it has so many uses, but one thing that it doesn’t do well is help protect your hard work from others. Python source code is plain-text, which means that anyone with access to your files can see what you wrote. Not great when you’ve just written the latest advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) or the best machine learning (ML) algorithm on the planet.
Python has a great feature where it first compiles your source code into bytecode; this is a low-level platform-independent representation of your source code. Back in the days when computers were slow, this was helpful, but when trying to distribute secure code this is a problem. Most solutions for securing Python code involve the distribution of .pyc files. Now, this isn’t all that bad as it doe…</span>

                    <span>While companies increasingly look to cloud computing as a means to expand, modernize and stay competitive, so too do those companies expose themselves to new risks. In fact, Ermetic and IDC report that 80% of CISOs claim their company has had a cloud data breach in the past 18 months. Nearly half of those (43%) had experienced 10 or more breaches.
The benefits of cloud computing are numerous, but organizations cannot make the switch to this modern platform without understanding the risks involved and, more importantly, how to protect themselves, their staff and their customers.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud service provider that’s on almost every company’s radar today. But many AWS customers today wonder what the best approach to security is and how to get there.

                    <span>What is an Azure DevOps Personal Access Token (PAT)?


A personal access token (PAT) is used as an alternative to using a password to authenticate into Azure DevOps. When you&#x27;re working with third-party tools, APIs or the command line that don&#x27;t support Microsoft or Azure AD accounts or you don&#x27;t want to provide your primary credentials to the tool, you can make use of PATs.
PATs are easy to create when you need them and easy to revoke when you don’t.

When creating a new PAT you can select the organization where you want to use the token, and then choose a lifespan for your token. Say for example making it only active and usable for a period of 30 days. A PATs lifetime can be extended if needed, but cannot be longer than the maximum period of 1 year. You can also specify granular permissi…</span>

The average person has to keep track of approximately 100 passwords and spends almost 13 minutes every week resetting those passwords. Due to this friction, password reuse is a major issue with over two-thirds of end users reusing passwords across sites, creating widespread security vulnerabilities. The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) found that credential vulnerabilities are involved in more than 80% of all data breaches. Since password reuse is so common, a single compromised password can endanger multiple accounts. 
Auth0 was the first IAM system to build support for passwordless authentication, and all of these reasons are as pertinent as ever:
Passwords are insecure: users pick insecure passwords and reuse them across sites. Since data breaches are common and they frequently include password information, this creates a situation where more and more sites are vulnerable to hacking attempts.
Passwords are expensive to manage: users forget them, and resetting passwords can be an expensive and time-consuming process.
Passwords negatively impact customer retention: remembering and typing a password, particularly on a phone keyboard, carries friction, and can cause returning customers to abandon the login flow, therefore impacting retention.
We believe that moving away from passwords as an authentication method is key to making the internet safer while reducing friction and positively impacting user acquisition and retention. 
Since our initial release, the authentication industry has been hard at work finding better ways to implement passwordless authentication. For example, the FIDO Alliance successfully led the specification and implementation of WebAuthn. In the last few years, Webauthn has been implemented in all major OS/browsers, with iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 being the latest to join the party in September 2020.

Basics of Docker
Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution for modern applications and services. Keycloak provides both SAML and OpenID protocol solutions.
Keycloak provides identity and access management, it is also open source. It has several deep features integrated which helps in building easier production grade application by including Keycloak for Authentication and Authorization.

                    <span>TypeScript is a fantastic programming language. With its typing layer on top of JavaScript, TypeScript verifies that your program uses the right type as you write code, avoiding potential issues at runtime.
In JavaScript, you reassign any type to any variable, or even access attributes that do not exist. Not with TypeScript since TypeScript checks types, ensuring only a value of the correct type to a variable or that attributes from an object actually exist.
For example, let’s take the following code.
let foo: number &#x3D; 42;
foo &#x3D; &quot;bli&quot;;

This code assigns a string to a variable that can only contain numbers and, therefore, will raise the following error at compile-time, as shown below.

Typescript error for not using the correct type.

                    <span>Angular is a framework, while React and Vue are libraries, therefore angular is heavier than the other two, due to its big codebase. The Angular’s core contains most of the functionalities you might need in your application, while with React and Vue, you have to find external libraries, maintained by independent contributors. Therefore, when working with React and Vue, you have to be more careful when choosing libraries, being aware that libraries with a poor maintenance might be deprecated in future.
To build an app with Angular you have to learn Typescript, which is a superset of JavaScript, while with Vue and React you can use pure JS. Regarding the view, with Angular and Vue you write it with HTML, where in React you have to write JSX, which is a syntax that allows coexistence between …</span>

A few quick words on my &quot;less than optimal&quot; hardware: I basically had to make do with a small laptop that has definitely seen better days (days that have long since passed, I should probably add) with a freshly installed Ubuntu 20. But I could, of course, connect to my PC at the office over company VPN, as I&#x27;m sure is the case for many of you as well.

It is common knowledge that NAS is a server-type storage system designed to store various information at the file level. In fact, this is a computer with an array of disks inside, which is connected to a network. Every authorized user can interact with any files stored in a NAS. Such storage systems are becoming more and more popular because most of them make use of the RAID technology: It provides a serious boost in fault tolerance and increases security of storing large amounts of data. However, there is no system to give you a 100% guarantee against data loss. Sometimes, users ha…</span>

As my time at Lambda School is coming to an end I wanted to talk about my incredible  experience from this past month.

The notification came in and I was placed in HRF Asylum  where I’ll be working with two teams of developers and data scientists that consisted of over 15 other students. It was the beginning of a memorable experience that had transitioned everyone of us from removing aspiring developers from our vocabulary.

Introduction of NodeJS
Installation of NodeJS and NPM

Basic Example
NodeJS is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side web applications. NodeJS also has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O.
NodeJS uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient
Installation of NodeJS and NPM is straightforward using the installer package available at NodeJS official web site.
Download the installer from NodeJS WebSite.

                    <span>When we&#x27;re trying to learn something new, it can oftentimes be tempting to dive headfirst into documentation, articles, and conceptual explanations. While all of that is certainly important, programmers have a great tool in their arsenal for understanding complex topics that they often take for granted.
Building models for different topics in code can help us understand how different pieces of an idea fit together and operate in practice.
In this tutorial, I&#x27;ll show you how to build a rudimentary blockchain with some relatively simple Javascript.
It can be helpful to think of blockchains as augmented linked lists, or arrays in which each element points to the preceding array.
Within each block (equivalent to an element in an array) of the blockchain, there contains at least the following:

                    <span>Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.
Dotenv Module will help us to populate runtime configuration during runtime, like populating mysql connection details while starting up mysql connection with nodejs, or providing mongodb connection url while starting application 
require(&#x27;dotenv&#x27;).config() it will populate all .env variables in process.env object
So all required configuration gets populated to process.env and application runs as expected.
Environment variables are supported out of the box with Node and are accessible via the env object (which is a property of the process global object.)

Open your terminal (linux hit: Ctrl + Alt + T) and run the following command. Running the command will create a new folder someproject in the current directory and change the current directory to someproject directory.
$ mkdir someproject &amp;&amp; cd someproject

To install the dependency of the project, we will use NPM (node package manager) so that the dependency can be installed easily.
Now, we need to run npm init. If you run this command, you will be asked some information. We can keep the default information. If you want, you can change it from the package.json.

                    <span>Material UI


Material UI is a set of react components built based on the Material Design guidelines of Google.
Material UI consists of many accessible and configurable UI widgets.
The components are self-supporting and only inject the styles they need to display, which could lead to performance enhancements in your application.
Material UI has an active set of maintainers and a strong community behind it. It currently has over 69k stars on GitHub, making it one of the most popular component libraries out there.
If you’re looking to build a beautiful, consistent, and light interface quickly without sacrificing accessibility and performance, the material design will help you achieve that.

                    <span>A queue uses FIFO (first-in-first-out) ordering, that is, items are removed from the queue in the same order that they are added, like a line.

A queue can be implemented using an array or a linked list, can be either fixed or dynamic size.
Add - Add an item to the end of the queue, also called enqueue.
Remove - Remove the first item from the queue, also called dequeue.
Peek - Return the top of the queue, without removing it.
isEmpty - Return true if the queue is empty.
isFull - Return true if the stack is full, used when the queue is fixed size.
Here&#x27;s an implementation of a queue using an array, in TypeScript an array doesn&#x27;t have a fixed length, so the operation isFull is not required, however, you can implement a queue with a fixed length and use that operation.
class Queue {
  private array: T[] &#x3D; [];

  add(data: T): void {
    this.array.push(data);
  }

  remove(): T | undefined {
    if (this.isEmpty()) throw new EmptyQueueException();

    return this.array.shift();
  }

  peek(): T {
    if (this.isEmpty()) throw new EmptyQueueException();

    return this.array[0];
  }

  isEmpty(): boolean {
    return this.array.length &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 0;
  }

                    <span>When we’re building an application we often need to serialize objects to JSON for storing them in a key value store (e.g. Redis) or publishing them on a queue.
While there are libraries available like class-transformer or io-ts, there&#x27;s an easier way to serialize/unserialize objects to JSON.
class-transformer depends on the reflect-metadata package. Read this blogpost to know why you should be careful with depending on this package.
io-ts requires knowledge of some functional programming concepts. While I&#x27;m a big fan of functional programming, it&#x27;s not for everyone. (The library is very well designed though)
In both cases we also need to depend on an extra package.
We want to keep our dependencies as small as possible.

                    <span>Hi, everyone! 6 months ago, we released our first open source vue components library Qui. And we got a lot of feedback about it. The most popular question was &quot;Does it work with Vue 3?&quot;, and now, It does! We called it Qui-max! Yes, as iPhone Max :)
Vue 3 is getting popular. We like Composition API, it really helps you to keep your code clean and composable. The component&#x27;s api became more predictable. Making components, we also used new features as Teleports, plural v-model and others.

Types included, you can build your components with clear predictions. (p.s. I couldn&#x27;t imagine how useful Typescript can be, before I try.)

We build components with Vite (rollup.js inside), with treeshake and separate css files, so you can use a few components only and take care about your bundle size. (but no so fast).




Added simple animations for dropdowns 




The library is under development, so if you find a bug feel free to make an issue in our repo Qui-max</span>

                    <span>In this article, we will take a closer look at template literal types and how you can take advantage of them in your day-to-day activities as a developer. 
So, what are template literal types?
In order to understand what template literal types are, we first need to have a brief look at literal types. Literal types allow us to define types that are more specific, instead of something that is generalized like string or number. 
Let&#x27;s say you have a switch; it can have the value of either on or off. One way of defining the types of this, is to use literal types, giving it the type of either On or Off:
type Switch &#x3D; &quot;On&quot; | &quot;Off&quot;

In the case above, the value of any variable of type Switch can only be On or Off:
const x: Switch &#x3D; &quot;On&quot;
const y: Switch &#x3D; &quot;Off&quot;

                    <span>Hi all, in this article, we will discuss what canDeactivate means and how to have a custom confirmation modal implemented based on our app theme.
In Angular we get in build support for the routes we define to have implementation for canDeactivate guard which is how we can restrict the user from moving away from the view when some work is in progress on the current view. Example User is making an edit on his profile page and didn&#x27;t click on the save button so at that time if we have implemented the router guard for canDeactivate, the user will be asked for the confirmation.

                    <span>It&#x27;s common to be concerned about security vulnerabilities in frontend frameworks. While Angular is the most preferred frontend framework among the developers for developing single-page applications, there are still security threats that need due attention for protecting Angular apps. 
Keep these top 5 security best practices at hand when building Angular apps. 
To prevent the injection of scripts into DOM elements such as authentication details, social security numbers, web tokens, etc. 
To prevent these malfunctions, use the InnerHTML property to sanitizes all the data that shows in components.

# sudo apt install curl git
$ git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.8.1

Abra o arquivo ~/.bashrc e adicione as seguintes linhas:
#
# asdf - language/tools version manager
#
source ~/.asdf/asdf.sh
source ~/.asdf/completions/asdf.bash

Execute:
$ . .bashrc
Pronto, basta testar:
$ asdf info
Para instalar a linguagem Go por exemplo, basta:
$ asdf install golang 1.16.5
$ asdf global golang 1.16.5

                    <span>Introduction


Keymapping or Key binding is a process in which a user or a system can assign certain keys or commands to perform a particular task or commands. This can be quite useful in Vim as well as in other text editors to avoid some repetitive tasks and save time. In Vim this can be a great power to have for programmers as it can be really very flexible to set up for any programming language and it&#x27;s environment.
This is not a in-depth guide of Vim-keymappings, it is just a overview of how to make keymappings and make the workflow a bit easier, probably give some insights on the strength of Vim to easily integrate with terminal and perform tasks with shortcuts. 
In Vim, you can map a particular keystroke combination to trigger a command or any operation. You can also map a key in pla…</span>

                    <span>I began building a blog application for a site that I may or may not finish. The bulk of the project is based on the blog-starter-typescript example in the NextJs GitHub repo. Their example loads markdown files from a folder in the root directory and uses remark and gray-matter to convert the markdown into html and to get file metadata. The example code for these function is located in their lib folder as api.ts and markdownToHtml.ts. 
The system they used works very well, however, if you plan on creating many posts and incorporating many images then that is when the system begins to breakdown. Since you store all of the markdown files and images in your root directory then it will perpetually grow and hosting costs for packages that large are affected.

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)

You can use cloud storage for on-premises data backups to reduce infrastructure and administration costs. There is several ways to backup your on-premise infrastructure to cloud, here I’ll use hybrid cloud (part of your infrastructure is on the cloud and part of your infrastructure is on the on-premise) to accomplish it. In this post I’ll show AWS Storage Gateway solutions to bridge between on-premise data to cloud. The common use case is disaster recovery, backup &amp; restore and tiered storage.
There is 3 types of Storage Gateway:

Before show how I implemented it, I’ll show a brief overview about each one.
Databases and applications are often backed up directly to a file server on-premises. You can now simply point these backups to the File Gateway, which copies the data to …</span>
