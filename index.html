                    <span>It&#x27;s my first week working at Playtomic and kind of a large task is already assigned to me: Migrating all the backend endpoint definitions and their related types from our B2B front app (Manager) to a separate GitHub package. 
The name of this new package of packages, Nemo.
Fishy , I think. No less than 8 packages in one, all just for the api client code?! Coming from a place where we just simply used an instance of Axios with the bare minimum configuration and direct calls to the backend REST api, this sounds like madness to me. 
[Image hinting the structure of Nemo? ]
But the task is simple and mechanical! All the important code infrastructure for Nemo is already there, so my work comes down to moving types and definitions from Manager to the different Nemo packages, adding testing and m…</span>

                    <span>Basically, I needed a means to provide a spinner that blocked functionality while API calls were in-flight. Additionally, I wanted to take into account that there could be more than one API request in-flight, at one time.
DEMO HERE
REPO HERE
My first attempt was to use an interceptor service that contained a BehaviorSubject (Observable). I set it up to maintain a counter and set the observable&#x27;s value to true if there were more than zero (0) requests in-flight.
Through heavy use of the console.log functionality, I came to realize that the interceptor was not always active, even though I was following proper singleton patterns.
The second attempt went more smoothly.
I had a second service (a handler) that maintained the counts and the BehaviorSubject. This one worked &quot;like a charm.&quot;

So, Reusable Workflows in GitHub Actions. Thanks to this feature you can now reference an entire Actions workflow in another workflow, like if it were a single action.
This new feature builds on top of the Composite Actions introduced a while back. If you don&#x27;t know what Composite Actions are, check this post or this video, but in short they are one or more steps packaged together which can be then referenced in an Actions workflows by a single line.

It also outlines a reference architecture that addresses common scalability and high availability requirements.


When the first version of WordPress was released in 2003, it was not built with modern elastic and scalable cloud-based infrastructures in mind. 


Through the work of the WordPress community and the release of various WordPress modules, the capabilities of this CMS solution are constantly expanding.


Today, it is possible to build a WordPress architecture that takes advantage of many of the benefits of the AWS Cloud.

How do you ensure those packets route to the server that can handle the request most efficiently?
Serving traffic as efficiently as possible, regardless of where it originates, is a critical requirement at Render. One answer to this challenge is to deploy a global fleet of servers to create an anycast network. What is an anycast network? What is it good for? How can you build your own?

Convox is showing its age and this year we began the process of replacing Convox with HashiCorp’s Nomad, a flexible workload orchestrator to deploy and manage our containers on AWS.
As we prepared our migration to Nomad, our biggest concern was performance. We started our tests with a barebones proof-of-concept setup of our API in Nomad. We benchmarked and compared the two systems and found Nomad was running slower. This was extremely surprising as Convox (which leverages AWS Elastic Container Services) and Nomad both use Docker containers under the covers. We assumed going from older to newer te…</span>

Because modern applications and services rely heavily on shared, open source components, securing them is best done as a collaborative, community effort.

                    <span>What are Terraform data sources?


Data sources in Terraform are used to get information about resources external to Terraform, and use them to set up your Terraform resources. For example, a list of IP addresses a cloud provider exposes.
We can find excellent examples of data source usage in the AWS provider docs:
variable &quot;vpc_id&quot; {}

data &quot;aws_vpc&quot; &quot;selected&quot; {
  id &#x3D; var.vpc_id
}

resource &quot;aws_subnet&quot; &quot;example&quot; {
  vpc_id            &#x3D; data.aws_vpc.selected.id
  availability_zone &#x3D; &quot;us-west-2a&quot;
  cidr_block        &#x3D; cidrsubnet(data.aws_vpc.selected.cidr_block, 4, 1)
}

In this scenario, we may have created our aws_vpc manually, because it also contains other manually created resources, and now we want to start adding Terraform managed resources to it.
In order to do this, we use the aw…</span>

Gating your content can be something of a gamble. On the one hand, allowing users to prematurely access your product means that you might wind up serving a lot of users who you never truly monetize. On the other hand, putting a login wall between potential users and content could lead to slower growth and a smaller user base.
According to Blue Research, 54% of users will abandon a website if the registration process is too cumbersome. Good product designers know all too well that interrupting a user in their intended path can be a great way to lose them.

                    <span>The Why


Lots of developers use Linux, but &quot;Linux&quot; is a vast category.  There are a lot of similarities, but a lot of differences, too.  Ubuntu and Fedora look and feel pretty similar until you try to install a package - whoops, apt is a little different than dnf. Specific system settings may be stored in different places, and particular commands may be included by default in one but not the other.  Then there&#x27;s even more niche stuff like Arch, which you install piece by piece from a very minimal package set, or Gentoo, which is similar to Arch with the additional caveat that the user compiles all the software locally for their specific hardware.  Users of these distros may end up with pretty different-looking operating systems that all fall under the broad Linux umbrella.

I prefer to install Linux in dual boot with Windows. I hardly use Windows but it gives me sort of back up if I mess up with things. Dual booting Linux with Windows is always suggestible for the beginners. In this, we see how to install Ubuntu in dual boot mode with Windows.
Before we see how to dual boot Ubuntu with Windows, let me give you some important details.
First, I had Windows 10 installed with 4 partitions on it. Later I installed Linux on it in dual boot mode. I changed the partition and kept around 200 GB of total 1TB for Linux installation.

you can find more on this link
npm is package manager tool for JavaScript in almost every web development project especially front-end projects. 
But this tools comes with different problems I&#x27;m sure your facing now which are:
the install process is kind of slow
not very friend log message.
large node_modules folder in every single project.
Facebook came up with an alternative tool yarn, it bit faster and have more friendly code log but have the same storage issue. I used to solve this issue by creating a main node_modules folder in my hard disk and use symlinks to all my folders, but it&#x27;s kind of frustrating so I drop this solution not very long after.
recently I have read about a new tool that solves the three issues that we discussed above that tool is called pnpm. pnpm is tools that is very similar to npm, if familiar with how npm commands pnpm is just the same. when using npm or yarn if have 1000 project that means you will have 1000 dependencies folder in each project in your hard drive, pnpm will install all the dependencies in one universal folder that is linked to all of your 1000 project using sumlinks that is managed for you under the hood.
this approach solve all the issues that we discussed earlier if you have already installed a dependency it will use that one instead of downloading in from the start. this means less storage used and faster installing process how cool is that, it even have a very minimalist log message. 
the first day I used pnpm I felt over the top because it solves an issue I hated so mush and after couple of days using it I&#x27;ve had no issues using it so I felt that I need to share this tool with everyone that didn&#x27;t hear about.
conclusion:
if you know any other tools that I didn&#x27;t hear about I&#x27;d love you to share your knowledge with me.</span>

Build such amazing dynamic realtime updated images, with the help of Node JS and puppeteer.

We usually tend to like dynamically generated content more, it has a bit more features and it feels cool.
Just an example of such image is the one below, this is directly being generated from a cloud function.
P.S: Note it may take some time to generate, it depends on multiple factors.

                    <span>Intro


This time I would like to tell you how to scrape YouTube search result with Node.js. I will show you how to do this with Puppeteer and an easier and more reliable way.
First, we need to create a Node.js project and add npm packages &quot;Puppeeteer&quot; and &quot;Puppeteer stealth plugin&quot;. To do this, in the directory with our project, open the command line and enter:
npm init -y
npm i puppeteer puppeteer-extra puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth
YouTube video search result

To select the required CSS selectors, I recommend something like SelectorGadget Chrome extension

const puppeteer &#x3D; require(&quot;puppeteer-extra&quot;);
const StealthPlugin &#x3D; require(&quot;puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth&quot;);

puppeteer.use(StealthPlugin());

const searchString &#x3D; &quot;psy&quot;;
const encodedString &#x3D; encodeURI(searchString);

When going into software development, for most web applications, there is a need to store data, persistently, in some form or the other. This could include the need to store login/authentication information, financial details, an e-shopper&#x27;s cart, training data for a machine learning model, etc. Amazingly, there are myriads of ways to store this data, examples include JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), XML, CSV (comma-separated values), or in a database, the most popular option, of course, being the mo…</span>

자, 개발을 하다보면 자동완성 하다보면,
toString() 메소드는 많이 익숙할 것이다.
valueOf() 메소드는 왜 있는가?
Date 객체 많이들 쓰고 있을 것이다. 이것이 편하든 불편하든 간에 많이들 쓸 것이다.
Date 객체를 다루다 보면 알게 되는게,
+new Date() 가 먹힌다. 결과는 new Date().getTime() 과 동일하다.
Date 객체 간 비교가 가능하다. oldDate  등의 비교문을 가능하게 한 것도? 맞다. valueOf() 메소드를 호출해서 비교하기 때문에 가능하다는 것이다.
valueOf() 메소드의 설명을 MDN에서 보도록 하자.
valueOf() 메서드는 특정 객체의 원시 값을 반환합니다.
원시 값이라면 생각나는게 숫자일 것이다. 부울 값도 있고.
[] 배열 식과, &quot;문자열&quot; 문자열 식도 원시 값으로 취급한다. 심지어 {} 같은 객체 식도. 원시 객체라 한다.
&quot;문자열&quot;.valueOf() 호출하면 문자열 그대로 나올 것이다.
그렇다면, 자신의 객체나 클래스에 valueOf() 재정의 하고 싶다?

                    <span>If you working with Node.js you probably interact with the database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and etc) via ORM. 
But sometimes typical ORM does not cover our needs. 
For example, when we need to write nested queries with aggregation in PostgreSQL. Or when the performance of a generated query using ORM does not suit us.
But what about solutions what will get to us good developer productivity like ORM, and will get a flexible API to interact with the database like pure SQL code.
If you have encountered such situations, then this post is for you!
In most cases we need some abstraction what will give to us typical operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete Operations). And Repository pattern will give to us this abstract Data Layer to interact with any database.

                    <span>Privacy and transparency are some of the most important requirements that most modern social networks like Facebook and Instagram do not meet. 
One of the best examples of privacy nightmare is TikTok is. It collects some very troubling data points such as the number of CPUs your device has, available disk space, your IP &amp; MAC addresses, whether your phone is jailbroken, and so much more, which does not have anything to do with TikTok. Imagine that there are so many more applications and websites that do essentially the same thing and sell your information to 3rd party advertisers. Internet is slowly becoming a place where one company can easily predict what type of person you are, based on all data points that they collected over time.
To end this, I have open-sourced the social network that I was working on for more than a year! It is called Polygon and the main goal for it is to be a social network that is not hungry for your data. Both the core and front-end are written in TypeScript and are seeking support from the open-source community. We also have a hosting guide that is written in Python.There is also some tooling written in Go. My main goal is to make it a private, easy-to-use, and crisp social network which will be adapted by privacy and open-source enthusiasts all over the world. 
Polygon is also open for Hacktoberfest contributions, which means that both beginners and professionals can contribute to the project and learn something new!

Gating your content can be something of a gamble. On the one hand, allowing users to prematurely access your product means that you might wind up serving a lot of users who you never truly monetize. On the other hand, putting a login wall between potential users and content could lead to slower growth and a smaller user base.
According to Blue Research, 54% of users will abandon a website if the registration process is too cumbersome. Good product designers know all too well that interrupting a user in their intended path can be a great way to lose them.

                    <span>An API exposes valuable data to be used by programs. REST is a standardized client-server architecture for APIs where resources are available at specific URLs. The client can query them (GET) and even write, modify and delete entries when specific endpoints exist.
GraphQL is a new approach. In most configurations, you will use one endpoint only to combine multiple queries in a single request.
It has many advantages over REST that can make sense, but it might raise security issues as well:
the default /graphql endpoint URL is quite often used in production, so it is an easy target
the introspection feature is sometimes left enabled on production, which can lead to non-public information disclosure
self-inflicted DDOS (distributed denial-of-service) are not uncommon because GraphQL queries can be significantly larger than REST queries (e.g., 10000 users and 70 posts per user makes 700 000 nodes to retrieve)
GraphQL schema design can be quite challenging, leading to expose more information than intended
string injections are not uncommon as queries are usually wrapped in JSON
everything connects to everything else, sometimes leading to authorization bypass when checks are not performed for each node
However, there are measures you can take:
don&#x27;t use the default endpoint /graphql
force SSL everywhere
use standardized authentication such as JWTs or OAuth
limit GraphQL operations to authenticated requests, as you&#x27;re not a public platform such as GitHub
limit query depth and add pagination
use static queries and avoid dynamically generated queries at runtime when it&#x27;s possible
disable logging, debugging and exploration tools on production (including GraphiQL), not only for security reasons but also for performance

Using a browser-based GraphiQL interface — such as the GraphiQL explorer provided by Contentful — you can inspect your schema right there in the browser, and construct your queries in no time. But how can you make sure your GraphQL queries are safe from nasties? Let’s find out.
To inspect your schema in Contentful’s GraphiQL interface and construct a GraphQL query, enter this URL in your browser, and swap out the SPACE_ID for your Contentful space ID, and ACCESS_TOKEN for your Contentful Delivery API Key.

there are 3 diff. k8s ingress controllers - see my post at

                    <span>It&#x27;s time to talk about it... Not Next, nor Nuxt, but Nest!
Some time ago, I challenged myself to build a robust backend solution in JavaScript. Many developers believe that JavaScript isn&#x27;t secure enough, efficient or simply organized to manage data through APIs. I&#x27;ll convince you otherwise....
For this new project, I chose technologies that are on the rise, in particular PostgreSQL but especially NestJS. So, I gave up my good old database that is MongoDB, in favor of a more traditional database.
NB: I was a little bit rusty at first, but going back to relational database was a real good idea; if only to retrieve data from several tables in one call, unlike NoSQL which requires as many calls as there are documents to query... Finally, SQL is like riding a bike, it&#x27;s unforgettable 😉

                    <span>If you working with Node.js you probably interact with the database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and etc) via ORM. 
But sometimes typical ORM does not cover our needs. 
For example, when we need to write nested queries with aggregation in PostgreSQL. Or when the performance of a generated query using ORM does not suit us.
But what about solutions what will get to us good developer productivity like ORM, and will get a flexible API to interact with the database like pure SQL code.
If you have encountered such situations, then this post is for you!
In most cases we need some abstraction what will give to us typical operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete Operations). And Repository pattern will give to us this abstract Data Layer to interact with any database.

                    <span>Privacy and transparency are some of the most important requirements that most modern social networks like Facebook and Instagram do not meet. 
One of the best examples of privacy nightmare is TikTok is. It collects some very troubling data points such as the number of CPUs your device has, available disk space, your IP &amp; MAC addresses, whether your phone is jailbroken, and so much more, which does not have anything to do with TikTok. Imagine that there are so many more applications and websites that do essentially the same thing and sell your information to 3rd party advertisers. Internet is slowly becoming a place where one company can easily predict what type of person you are, based on all data points that they collected over time.
To end this, I have open-sourced the social network that I was working on for more than a year! It is called Polygon and the main goal for it is to be a social network that is not hungry for your data. Both the core and front-end are written in TypeScript and are seeking support from the open-source community. We also have a hosting guide that is written in Python.There is also some tooling written in Go. My main goal is to make it a private, easy-to-use, and crisp social network which will be adapted by privacy and open-source enthusiasts all over the world. 
Polygon is also open for Hacktoberfest contributions, which means that both beginners and professionals can contribute to the project and learn something new!

Let&#x27;s start by creating our strapi and refine projects.
Strapi

After the project is loaded, the admin panel will open automatically open in the browser. We need to create an admin user in order to log in to the strapi.

With the information we will create here, we can now enter the strapi and start shaping our backend.
After logging into the Strapi interface, we have two collection models that we need to create for our e-mail subscription project.

That being said, if anyone has time to check it out and provide feedback, here is the link. The library provides useful methods when working with dates in JavaScript/TypeScript. I wrote it in TypeScript, so you get type declarations right out of the box. 
I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback. Also, if you want to contribute, just let me know :)
This has definitely been a learning experience for me. I live in my own little world as a front end developer. I install and use npm packages but never really considered that anyone can write one and publish it.</span>

                    <span>Validating tags in Angular Material does not work as it should out-of-the-box, so I am sharing my custom version. This assumes you are familiar with basic angular reactive forms, and are using Angular Material Chips to handle your tags input.
Here you will be able to produce min and required errors, as well as display them in mat-error as expected out-of-the-box. Unfortunately, Angular does not work this way out-of-the-box.

Suppose you have an angular application and need to automate building and deployment also you are looking for how to do it. 
You are in the right place.
👉 Angular application
👉 Github account
👉 surge token and domain name
👉 Push your application to github repo
👉 Add a  folder .github/workflows/ in the root location and create a file with an extension of yml inside of it . Lets say (deplyment.yml) ( .github/workflows/)
  name : Build and Deploy

If you omit name inside the workflow file, GitHub will set workflow name to the workflow file path relative to the root of the repository.
A workflow trigger is required for a workflow. We need to provide event that trigger the workflow

Maintainer and what was my end goal behind maintaining &quot;ComEve&quot;?


Maintainers are the keystone of open source. This year’s Hacktoberfest has a new, added focus: empowering open source maintainers.
Community Events Platform Project by this Hacktoberfest is to support and guide new joiners who are willing to contribute, I opened everything in terms of issues and created basic issues and middle level issues, so that every level of joiner can contribute, sometimes I hookup the calls with joiners, I did the guidance calls with contributors from India and South Africa to give them a overall walk through.

Volunteer and giving up personal time to create something of value for the world.
Reviewing and Merging Pull Request
Collaborations with Developers throughout the world.
Maintain a project when you own a team.
Be respectful and allow people to contribute in a way that makes the project better.
Encourage developers however the pull request is buggy and production breaking ding, motivate them to fix and fly high as per terms of opensource.

                    <span>Downloading WSA


Download WSA preview from here:
https://server.deltaonealpha.workers.dev/MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_1.7.32815.0_neutral___8wekyb3d8bbwe.Msixbundle
Then install it using Powershell with the command:
add-appxpackage -Path &quot;
&quot;
Downloading and installing app should be through amazon store but for non-US countries its not available in the preview, so you will have to manually download an apk and install it using &quot;adb install&quot;.
Install ADB as instructed here: https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/
Open the Windows Subsystem for Linux app and enable developer mode. An IP address and port will be shown, use this to execute the ADB command:
adb connect 
Now simply open Windows PowerShell or CMD and type
adb install &quot;
&quot;
That&#x27;s it, and your APK will be installed, all you need to do now is open Start and find your installed app in the list!
NOTE: Make sure WSA is running. To run WSA open the app and select open &quot;File&quot;.</span>

Enter Pokemon-Terminal. With few steps, you are ready to rock your terminal with pokemon themes.
Firstly, the default cmd prompt in windows is not supported, hence download the windows terminal from here


Install python3 &amp; pip3


Run the following command to download and setup the Pokemon-Terminal




pip3 install git+https://github.com/LazoCoder/Pokemon-Terminal.git

Once installed you should be able to execute to set the pokemon theme in the windows terminal

Chroot is a method of focusing on a part of your filesystem. This changes apparent root directory. Which gives asscess to root filesystem and root access in order to perform various operations on the system.
Recovering a broken install (Reinstalling the bootloader)

Sometimes in case dual boot, due to a Windows Update or a BIOS Update, It may happen that you are left with the default bios options which has Legacy Boot mode and you only have windows as a option to boot. Or maybe you just deleted your EFI partition somehow!
In this case the data in our linux partitions is safe but you cant access it directly. In order to gain access to the system you need to resintall GRUB (or more specifical…</span>

                    <span>Some time ago I got a WRC case transferred where a customer asks for the availability of a raw DEFLATE compression/decompression function built-in Caché.
When we talk about DEFLATE we need to talk about Zlib as well, since Zlib is the de-facto standard free compression/decompression library developed in the mid-90s.
Zlib works on particular DEFLATE compression/decompression algorithm and the idea of encapsulation within a wrapper (gzip, zlib, etc.).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib
In Caché Object Script (COS) we already have GZIP support available in using /GZIP&#x3D;1 on file- or tcp-devices or our Streamclasses for use with gzip files.

                    <span>The modern internet today is programmed in such a way that, the traffic is encrypted. Now, what does this encryption mean? In simple terms, encryption ensures only those who are meant to understand the information do so, and for others, it is just gibberish.
Encryption transforms readable plaintext into unreadable ciphertext that only the intended users can understand. This prevents attackers from making sense of the data even if they get access to it. The intended users will be aware of how to convert the ciphertext into plaintext, a process known as decryption.
A simple encryption example is, say alphabet A -&gt; 1, B -&gt; 2, C -&gt; 3, so on.. So the word CAB would be 321. The receiver will convert the 321 back to plain text by mapping the numbers to alphabets -&gt; CAB.

Here we will use very simple example of using the secret. There is a pod that runs a Java application. This application connects to the database which is running external to the application pod. It can be on another pod or outside of the OpenShift cluster. The application just needs the database username and password to connect to the database (along with other obvious details like host, port and so on). We will treat database password as the only sensitive information. The application reads the database password from the configuration file stored on the file system accessible to the application.

Writing clean code
Testing the dependencies
Throwing exceptions when we are supposed to
Writing clean and useful error messages

                    <span>So, you started writing an app or library in Solid.js and TypeScript - what an excellent choice - but now you want to unit test everything as fast as possible to avoid regressions.
We already know how to do this with jest, but while it is pretty convenient and quite easy to set up, it&#x27;s also considerably slow and somewhat opinionated. Unlike more lightweight test runners, it also has a built-in code transformation API, a jsdom-based DOM environment and chooses browser conditional exports by default.
So what we need to run our tests without jest is:
Code transformation
DOM environment
Choosing browser exports
To save even more of your precious time, I already did all this work for you. You just need to install

NextJS is one of the strongest framework to build a production project. I&#x27;ve used some features like SSG or pre-render pages at build time, API routes, file-system routing, fast refresh, configuration and deployments are super easy.

We&#x27;ll be working on the project of this tutorial  Build an API using Node, Express, MongoDB, and Docker . You can find the code source for this tutorial  here.   
Simply, authentication is the process of verifying the identity of someone. 
Authorization is the process of verifying what data the user can have access to.
And authorization only occurs when you&#x27;ve been authenticated. Then, the system will grant you access to the files you need.
First of all, clone the project.
git clone https://github.com/koladev32/node-docker-tutorial.git

Once it&#x27;s done, go inside the project and run.

Starting from Ubuntu and Fedora I finally came to the elementary OS project&#x27;s website. And it was quite astonishing. In comparison to the other distributions elementary had its view on how the operating system should view, how to make apps, its own design language and developers documentation. Thereby the decision to move to this OS was easy.
For now, it is almost two years since I moved from macOS to elementary OS as my daily driver. And, as I said earlier, I&#x27;m a developer. After looking for a native text editor I made myself think to make Norka. But, this article is about the distinct application. Actually, I&#x27;m not the author of it, the app is already a part of ele…</span>

                    <span>Merhabalar, bu yazıda Linux sistemlerde yeni bir kullanıcı oluşturmayı, oluşturduğumuz kullanıcıya şifre atamayı, root yetkisi vermeyi ve yetkilerini görüntülemeyi inceleyeceğiz. İyi okumalar :)
Yeni bir kullanıcı oluşturmak için;
sudo useradd 

komutu kullanılır.

Oluşturulan kullanıcıya şifre atamak için;
sudo passwd 

komutu kullanılır.

Tüm kullanıcıların görüntüleyebileceği dosyalar, çalıştırabileceği komutlar olduğu gibi sadece root yetkisine sahip kullanıcıların görüntüleyebileceği dosyalar ve çalıştırabileceği komutlar da vardır.
Oluşturduğumuz kullanıcıya, 

Bir kullanıcı root yetkisine sahip olduğunda istediği bütün işlemleri gerçekleştirebilir. Sistemi daha esnek ve güvenli kullanmak için root yetkisi verirken dikkatli olmalıyız. Root yetkisine sahip kullanıcıları;
cat /etc/sudoers
dosyası altında görüntüleyebiliriz.
Bu dosyayı düzenlemek için ;
sudo visudo 

komutu kullanılır.

Komutu çalıştırıp, rootun bulunduğu kısmın altına,
 ALL&#x3D;(ALL)    ALL

satırını ekleyerek kendi kullanıcımıza bütün izinleri vererek, kullanıcımıza root yetkisi vermiş oluruz.

Bir kullanıcının hangi yetkilere sahip olduğunu görmek için; 
sudo -l 
komutu kullanılır.</span>

                    <span>These days, it is a common trend to build a single page application (SPA) using a modern front-end web framework such as Angular, React, Vue, etc., and a server-side backend Web API. In this tutorial, I will walk you through a complete example of creating a single page application using Angular that will connect a server-side ASP.NET Core 5 Web API to fetch data from a SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core (Code First). At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to display some useful stats related to football players.

When you want to build your own Design System on top of Angular Material (or pretty much any other 3rd party component library), you have a couple of options:
Build a custom Angular Material theme and use the components as they are described in the documentation.
Build a custom Angular Material theme and build your own component library on top of Angular Material by wrapping their components in your own components.
There are pros and cons with both approaches. That is a topic for another post so I’m not going into the details here. Long story short, we went wi…</span>

Effects are a powerful model for handling side effects in your application. Commonly this means when you are making a HTTP request in a NgRx powered application you will use an effect to handle the communication with the service but they can do so much more than that. And frankly this is what I usually used them for until I read https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/start-using-ngrx-effects-for-this#handling-the-flow-of-a-angular-material-dialog . 
I became intrigued by the idea of offloading some component material dialog code into the effect and started viewing the life cycle as a series of events and using the effect to talk to other effects. This can keep components more simple and pure where they use selectors to read data and dispatch actions in response to…</span>
