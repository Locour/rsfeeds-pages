                    <span>There are a lot of headlines about Tesla that overstate a story for clicks, and I can assure you this is not one of them.
Before I&#x27;m accused of being a hater: I am a Tesla owner and shareholder. I&#x27;m no Elon Musk fanboy, but I definitely root on Tesla&#x27;s environmentally-driven mission of accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy. I&#x27;ll also say that I personally hope this does not result in reactionary regulation of autonomous driving software in the USA because current rules seem reasonable and I don&#x27;t necessarily trust that changes would happen in good faith.
And major hugops to all the developers and admins doing their best with all of this — I&#x27;m posting this on DEV because it&#x27;s an interesting software story that deserves attention, not to be critical of the engineering tea…</span>

                    <span>Testing applications is very important to ensure that existing functionalities keep on running while you add new ones. It’s like how brakes in a car enables it to run faster. On the flip side, executing tests can be a chore. Unless of course you have proper automations in place.

Follow this link to find out how to setup Xcode Server to continuously run automated tests on macOS applications—both unit tests and user interface tests. Let the bots do the mundane work while developers do what they do best: create new features.</span>

Does it impact #nginx ingress OSS and Enterprise versions ? asked below - https://lnkd.in/gNUTzwzV - no answer yet but  𝑰 𝒔𝒖𝒔𝒑𝒆𝒄𝒕 𝒀𝑬𝑺 ? because nginx ingress docs allows snippet too at https://lnkd.in/gMBQDZVV - hope some experts can confirm soon because OSS nginx ingress is also widely used !


Policy checks - thanks to #kyverno team, e.g. Jim Bugwadia has a good check rule at https://lnkd.in/gtUy-UNu ! Another good reason to use Policy in k8s to safeguard any CVEs.


there are 3 diff. k8s ingress controllers - see my post at
https://lnkd.in/gC5Pcnv8 so make sure you use the correct image names in your checks, e.g. OPA rego, Kyverno rules, e.g. see more at https://lnkd.in/gGUN7wW9


do not use Snippets as said below - https://lnkd.in/gMBQDZVV

                    <span>Validating tags in Angular Material does not work as it should out-of-the-box, so I am sharing my custom version. This assumes you are familiar with basic angular reactive forms, and are using Angular Material Chips to handle your tags input.
Here you will be able to produce min and required errors, as well as display them in mat-error as expected out-of-the-box. Unfortunately, Angular does not work this way out-of-the-box.

                    <span>Note: You need a basic understand of Angular reactive forms for this.
There is not a custom validator in Angular for confirm passwords, so I found one here. I don&#x27;t want to have to rewrite the code in my component, so here is my version that just &#x27;works&#x27; out of the box.
Create a file called form-validators.ts with this:
export function matchValidator(
  matchTo: string, 
  reverse?: boolean
): ValidatorFn {
  return (control: AbstractControl): 
  ValidationErrors | null &#x3D;&gt; {

                    <span>Hey there, 🖐
Suppose you have an angular application and need to automate building and deployment also you are looking for how to do it. 
You are in the right place.
👉 Angular application
👉 Github account
👉 surge token and domain name
👉 Push your application to github repo
👉 Add a  folder .github/workflows/ in the root location and create a file with an extension of yml inside of it . Lets say (deplyment.yml) ( .github/workflows/)
  name : Build and Deploy

If you omit name inside the workflow file, GitHub will set workflow name to the workflow file path relative to the root of the repository.
A workflow trigger is required for a workflow. We need to provide event that trigger the workflow

Maintainer and what was my end goal behind maintaining &quot;ComEve&quot;?


Maintainers are the keystone of open source. This year’s Hacktoberfest has a new, added focus: empowering open source maintainers.
Community Events Platform Project by this Hacktoberfest is to support and guide new joiners who are willing to contribute, I opened everything in terms of issues and created basic issues and middle level issues, so that every level of joiner can contribute, sometimes I hookup the calls with joiners, I did the guidance calls with contributors from India and South Africa to give them a overall walk through.

Github - ComEve

Volunteer and giving up personal time to create something of value for the world.
Reviewing and Merging Pull Request
Collaborations with Developers throughout the world.
Maintain a project when you own a team.
Be respectful and allow people to contribute in a way that makes the project better.
Encourage developers however the pull request is buggy and production breaking ding, motivate them to fix and fly high as per terms of opensource.

                    <span>Writing Bash scripts can be challenging if you don&#x27;t know the quirks and perks. In my mother tongue, we use the Yiddish word for quirks and perks; it&#x27;s called &quot;Shtickim&quot; (plural of &quot;Shtick&quot;). Are you ready to learn more about Bash&#x27;s &quot;Shtickim&quot;?
This blog post is part of a series that I&#x27;m working on in my spare time to preserve the knowledge for future me that forgets stuff, to assist new colleagues, and indulge programmers like you who wish to love Bash as I do. So let&#x27;s begin, shall we?
It&#x27;s important to remember that Bash is a scripting language, which means it doesn&#x27;t offer the standard functionalities that a programming language has to offer, such as:

                    <span>Atlantis is an old and battle-tested self-hosted tool that provides a layer of automation and collaboration for Terraform. Lacking a user interface other than server flags and YAML configuration files, Atlantis uses your VCS as one, listening for pull request notifications and posting feedback as comments.
Using Atlantis has two major benefits over running Terraform in a “generic” CI system. First, it strikes the right balance between specialized and flexible: custom workflows give you a level of control that’s not possible within a tool like Terraform Cloud. Second, it runs on your infrastructure, which allows it to access resources inside a VPC or use cloud-specific dynamic credentials.

Overall it&#x27;s been a lot of fun and learning along the way, I&#x27;m not going to lie here, the learning curve seemed propelled by a rocket but turned out to be quite simple once you grab your head around the new terminology and  concepts . Just like anything in tech.
Once I understood the hows and whys then I was buildpacking this and buildpacking that, pretty soon I found myself doing repetitive jobs that were begging to be automized.

                    <span>We all have the startup bug inside of us where we think we have a great idea in a split second and then we lose it all together the next. 
Well since we are programmers, it always feels to have a project ready so that we can jump right in to start developing our idea. 
This is less of a post and more of a trick to save time. Just create a boiler plate with the required folder structure and file names and packages you are damn sure gonna use in your next project. You can host this on github or somewhere else and have branches and other merging strategies ready too. 
So next time all you have to do is clone the project and you are on your way. 
P.S. This also helps when you feel the idea is not going to work since you did not spend too much time tryng to setup your project. 
Here is a sample of an app project which I use frequently. 
https://github.com/vjnvisakh-boilerplate/flutter
I promise to keep adding to it so that I have to spend the least time setting it up next time.

👉 Add a  folder .github/workflows/ in the root location and create a file with an extension of yml inside of it . Lets say (deplyment.yml) ( .github/workflows/)

If you omit name inside the workflow file, GitHub will set workflow name to the workflow file path relative to the root of the repository.
A workflow trigger is required for a workflow. We need to provide event that trigger the workflow

                    <span>Chapter 1: Introduction and Design Considerations.


Traditionally, applications were designed and implemented using a Monolithic architectural style, with which the application was developed and deployed as a single component, divided into multiple modules. Monolithic applications are very easy to develop and deploy.
However, such an architectural pattern becomes a burden once the application becomes too large:
Difficult to manage and maintain, due to the large code.
All of the application is built using one programming language, thus the system may suffer from bottlenecks when performing tasks not suitable for this specific language.
Difficult to scale the application.
Difficult to use container based technologies (Due to the large size of the application).

                    <span>We have came across situations where we need to feed the custom files to the applications deployed in OpenShift. These files will be consumed by the application for the further operations.
Consider a scenario - An application allows users to create custom jar files using the provided SDK, and feed it to the application to execute that customization. These custom jars should be made available to the application through Java CLASSPATH by copying it to the appropriate path.
OpenShift has two options to handle such scenarios.
Persistent Volumes (PV) allows to share the file storage between application pods and external world. Users can copy the files to PV to make it available to the pods (for example configuration files), or pods can create the files to make it accessible outside the OpenShif…</span>

Unlike App Review, notarization is a completely automated process that does not require human intervention. At least it’s automated on Apple’s side. You would need to invest a good amount of effort in setting up automation otherwise spend even more time notarizing every release.

Download WSA preview from here:
https://server.deltaonealpha.workers.dev/MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_1.7.32815.0_neutral___8wekyb3d8bbwe.Msixbundle
Then install it using Powershell with the command:
add-appxpackage -Path &quot;
&quot;
Downloading and installing app should be through amazon store but for non-US countries its not available in the preview, so you will have to manually download an apk and install it using &quot;adb install&quot;.
Install ADB as instructed here: https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/
Open the Windows Subsystem for Linux app and enable developer mode. An IP address and port will be shown, use this to execute the ADB command:
adb connect 
Now simply open Windows PowerShell or CMD and type
adb install &quot;
&quot;
That&#x27;s it, and your APK will be installed, all you need to do now is open Start and find your installed app in the list!
NOTE: Make sure WSA is running. To run WSA open the app and select open &quot;File&quot;.</span>

SSH server: It is the component that will enable a machine to listen or be open to accept SSH connections from clients.
SSH client: It is the component that will allow a machine to connect to a remote server that is listening to incoming connections.

When we talk about DEFLATE we need to talk about Zlib as well, since Zlib is the de-facto standard free compression/decompression library developed in the mid-90s.
Zlib works on particular DEFLATE compression/decompression algorithm and the idea of encapsulation within a wrapper (gzip, zlib, etc.).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib
In Caché Object Script (COS) we already have GZIP support available in using /GZIP&#x3D;1 on file- or tcp-devices or our Streamclasses for use with gzip files.

Simply, authentication is the process of verifying the identity of someone. 
Authorization is the process of verifying what data the user can have access to.
And authorization only occurs when you&#x27;ve been authenticated. Then, the system will grant you access to the files you need.
First of all, clone the project.

                    <span>The conventional wisdom is that you should have good test coverage before refactoring your code. Making mistakes during refactoring will introduce defects in the software if they are not caught during testing. Such regression defects can annoy users, break the software and even lead to customers abandoning the product.
The need for automated testing is especially high for JavaScript. In a dynamic language with functional constructs like JavaScript, it is harder to detect breakages statically. Additionally, JavaScript has many language details and quirks that are not well known or easy to remember.
In practice, however, there is a chance that you will encounter situations where you need to work in untested or insufficiently tested legacy code. Often this is precisely the kind of code that w…</span>

Well, currently it does not support so many  features, but some of them i am going to list below.
@dsabyte supports two themes as of now, dark  and light. 


You can see all posts written on @dsabyte 

In this post, you don&#x27;t just write a single post, rather you create a series of posts. So, whenever any user loads your website, he/she can see all the posts written under that series. 

There is an online editor, where you can write markdown texts for the post. This editor also supports dark and light theme.


When you make a post private, then it will be removed from the posts list, but it&#x27;s public url won&#x27;t be lost.

It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
Node.js is a platform built on Google Chrome&#x27;s JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine) for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

                    <span>Migrating to Deno can be hard when you depend on Node modules. Until those Node modules get ported to Deno, you can use these three methods to import Node modules in Deno.
compatibility layer


There is a Node compatibility layer in Deno standard library, which allows you to require() anything which is in node_modules.
import { createRequire } from &#x27;https://deno.land/std/node/module.ts&#x27;;

const require &#x3D; createRequire(import.meta.url);

const path &#x3D; require(&#x27;path&#x27;);
const cjsModule &#x3D; require(&#x27;./my_mod&#x27;);
const leftPad &#x3D; require(&#x27;left-pad&#x27;);

It was buggy for me as I wasn&#x27;t able to import every module, and the need to have node_modules is also a downside, which brings me to...
If you are lucky, the authors of the library may have the source code using ES6 imports (and doesn&#x27;t import any node builtins) and you can import the source code directly from the URL (remember, you can import any URLs!)
For example, you could import lodash like so:
import cloneDeep from &#x27;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lodash/lodash/master/cloneDeep.js&#x27;;

I got that URL by going to the file on GitHub and then clicking the raw button.
But sometimes, you also need to support all those node builtins. That brings me to...
JSPM is a module CDN which allows you to import any node module in the browser, and by extension that means that you can use it to import to deno too! 
JSPM is the most reliable method so far, it is used in my Web Framework Sleek too!
So if you want to import the wonderful recast library, you can do this:
import recast from &#x27;https://jspm.dev/recast&#x27;;

And that&#x27;s it, you can now use recast!

                    <span>Situation 🤔


Some time ago, I was implementing a cross domain iFrame in Next.js and ran into a slight problem when it came to dynamically setting its height. Due to limitations imposed by the browser, we&#x27;re prevented from using JS magic to access the page and getting the actual height of the document. A library, iframe-resizer promised to solve the issue however it required a small script to be placed on the page hosting the iFrame. Unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t an option 🚫
Fortunately, at two redbulls deep, Poros had mercy and an ✨idea✨ came outta no where. What I wanted to accomplish was, on page load, assign a height to the iFrame that will display all it&#x27;s contents without unneeded whitespace. Why not do it in the most straight forward way possible? Remotely load the URL that will get d…</span>

                    <span>The modern internet today is programmed in such a way that, the traffic is encrypted. Now, what does this encryption mean? In simple terms, encryption ensures only those who are meant to understand the information do so, and for others, it is just gibberish.
Encryption transforms readable plaintext into unreadable ciphertext that only the intended users can understand. This prevents attackers from making sense of the data even if they get access to it. The intended users will be aware of how to convert the ciphertext into plaintext, a process known as decryption.
A simple encryption example is, say alphabet A -&gt; 1, B -&gt; 2, C -&gt; 3, so on.. So the word CAB would be 321. The receiver will convert the 321 back to plain text by mapping the numbers to alphabets -&gt; CAB.

                    <span>SSH ( Secure Shell ) is a program that is used to create a secure connection between two network enabled hosts. With this connection, the user will be able to get remote access to machines or transfer data between machines. Both these operations are critical from a security point of view, and even one slight vulnerability will cause a heavy damage.
SSH server: It is the component that will enable a machine to listen or be open to accept SSH connections from clients.
SSH client: It is the component that will allow a machine to connect to a remote server that is listening to incoming connections.
There are two major versions of SSH. SSH version 1 &amp; SSH version 2.

Here we will use very simple example of using the secret. There is a pod that runs a Java application. This application connects to the database which is running external to the application pod. It can be on another pod or outside of the OpenShift cluster. The application just needs the database username and password to connect to the database (along with other obvious details like host, port and so on). We will treat database password as the only sensitive information. The application reads the database password from the configuration file stored on the file system accessible to the application.

What guarantees you, that, that prototype hasn&#x27;t been hacked already? Nothing does.

The exploits lists that you see on the web from time to time are a great tool for hackers, first, they know that their work actually worked. Then they will follow the progress of the solution for those exploits, especialy if they are on an opensource project. They will make sure that the community gets together to solve it, so they can join the project and work on just another &quot;bug&quot;, they will actively contribute to the project so they know exactly how it works, to exploit it once again.</span>

                    <span>So, you started writing an app or library in Solid.js and TypeScript - what an excellent choice - but now you want to unit test everything as fast as possible to avoid regressions.
We already know how to do this with jest, but while it is pretty convenient and quite easy to set up, it&#x27;s also considerably slow and somewhat opinionated. Unlike more lightweight test runners, it also has a built-in code transformation API, a jsdom-based DOM environment and chooses browser conditional exports by default.
So what we need to run our tests without jest is:
Code transformation
DOM environment
Choosing browser exports
To save even more of your precious time, I already did all this work for you. You just need to install
npm i --save-dev solid-register jsdom

NextJS is one of the strongest framework to build a production project. I&#x27;ve used some features like SSG or pre-render pages at build time, API routes, file-system routing, fast refresh, configuration and deployments are super easy.

We&#x27;ll be working on the project of this tutorial  Build an API using Node, Express, MongoDB, and Docker . You can find the code source for this tutorial  here.   
Simply, authentication is the process of verifying the identity of someone. 
Authorization is the process of verifying what data the user can have access to.
And authorization only occurs when you&#x27;ve been authenticated. Then, the system will grant you access to the files you need.
First of all, clone the project.
git clone https://github.com/koladev32/node-docker-tutorial.git

Oh man I&#x27;m very exhausted. Every time I initiate a new project, I have to configure the following setup or config from the beginning.
That&#x27;s my thoughts when I was a beginner even until now, LOL. I often felt wasting my time when I have to configure the following configuration every time I started a new project, especially in frontend development.
But this thing changed when I know a friend who is a pro in React Development. I ever work with him as a team in a freelance project. Suddenly, I saw his newest personal site and found several starter templates made using Next.js, Vite, and other else.
I asked him, Why you made this? This is just a basic starter template.. Then he answered, Yes of course. So I don&#x27;t need to overthink about the configuration every time I initiate a…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Currently, I&#x27;m learning about React &amp; Next.js. To understand how it works, I usually push myself to make some mini-projects using that framework. One thing I hate when I develop a project, it&#x27;s about config.
It started when I knew a friend who made his own starter template. I asked him, Why do you make it?. He answered, Well I don&#x27;t need to worry about the &#x27;configuration&#x27; thing when I initiate a new project. So I can focus on the development process..
I think it&#x27;s a great idea. I also don&#x27;t need to feel anxious about the configuration when I make a new project if I have my own starter template.
Here&#x27;s how I made my starter template using Next.js and Chakra UI.
This time, I used the example of base starter template that Next.js provide.

                    <span>There are different approaches to style components in React applications. Each of them has its pros and cons, and, of course, preference in choosing a particular library is sometimes subjective. It can cause misunderstanding in a team when you&#x27;re not agreeing with using styled-components in your project because you&#x27;d already worked with one library before, and it&#x27;s not prominent and easy to switch to see the benefits of a new approach. Here you have a question: &quot;Why should I use this instead of this?&quot; and we&#x27;re going to answer it at first.
One of our team members asked this question because he always used CSS Modules and didn&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s useful. Yes, adding classnames to HTML tags or even child components is very clear and understandable which styles we&#x27;re implementing, but here …</span>

Si quisiéramos compararlo con la vida real podría ser con una hamburguesería. Primero tendríamos el proceso general, el cual es tomar el pedido y entregarlo al cliente, el cliente pide una hamburguesa, una gaseosa y que de todas las cremas solo quiere mayonesa.
Como el proceso general sigue siendo el mismo, que es entregar el pedido todos estos procesos reciben el pedido como si fueran el &quot;cliente&quot;, pero en realidad no lo son, solo van a agregar algo al pedido, por ejemplo, salió la hamburguesa, la de las gaseosas tomo el pedido y le puso una gaseosa ahora lo delega para que le pongan cremas, cada proceso que afecte al pedio la agregue cosas a este serán decoradores.

                    <span>The Problem


Typescript and mongoose is a headache I&#x27;m sure many of us has encountered. This is for one major reason - it severely goes against the principle of DRY (Don&#x27;t Repeat Yourself). To illustrate my point, please look at the following example given by the official mongoose docs
import { Schema, model } from &#x27;mongoose&#x27;;

// 1. Create an interface representing a document in MongoDB.
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  avatar?: string;
}

// 2. Create a Schema corresponding to the document interface.
const schema &#x3D; new Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true },
  avatar: String
});

// 3. Create a Model.
const UserModel &#x3D; model(&#x27;User&#x27;, schema);

As you can see above, you&#x27;re literally repeating the structur…</span>

                    <span>Class static blocks came to Typescript in v4.4, and is on the roadmap for becoming an official ECMAScript feature as well! It&#x27;s used to contain any initialization for the class. The reason this feature is so helpful is because it can access all private internals of the class it&#x27;s in, as well!
class Unicorn {
  static #isShiny &#x3D; false;
  static #shinyLevel &#x3D; 0;

  static {
    const { hasRainbowHorn, hasRainbowTail } &#x3D; getData(Unicorn);
    if (hasRainbowHorn || hasRainbowTail) {
      // access and modify internals!
      this.#isShiny &#x3D; true;
      this.#shinyLevel &#x3D; Math.random();
    }
  }
}

You can create multiple static blocks in a class, which will be executed in sequential order.
This feature is definitely small - but I thought it was cool and wanted to share it with you all. However, since this post would be so short, I though I should add a...
While we&#x27;re talking about static classes: do you know the best way to make a class unconstructable? This might come in handy for a utility class with only static methods. The most popular method is:
class Util {
  public constructor() {
    throw new Error(&#x27;Do not initialize this class!&#x27;);
  }
}

However, you can shorten it by just extending null:
class Util extends null {}

new Util(); // TypeError!

                    <span>The Web Storage API is a good example of a simple-yet-powerful feature, but while using it, I found myself repeating JSON.stringify() while saving objects and that was frustrating. Add to it the absence of a way to set when you want your local data to expire and you&#x27;ll have all the ingredients that led me to create localit.
A simple example of how easy it is to use localit:
import { localit } from &quot;localit&quot;;

localit.set(&quot;article&quot;, &quot;localit 101&quot;, &quot;3h&quot;);

console.log(localit.get(&quot;article&quot;));
//  &quot;localit 101&quot;

localit&#x27;s core methods are the same you would use while saving and retrieving data from localStorage.
set(), get() and remove()


These methods wrap and replace the logic behind setItem, getItem and removeItem(), removing the need to use JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse(), which I thin…</span>

                    <span>Intro


Almost two years ago I lost my iMac and it brought me an idea to see what&#x27;s changed in the Linux world for 10 years. Starting from Ubuntu and Fedora I finally came to the elementary OS project&#x27;s website. And it was quite astonishing. In comparison to the other distributions elementary had its view on how the operating system should view, how to make apps, its own design language and developers documentation. Thereby the decision to move to this OS was easy.
For now, it is almost two years since I moved from macOS to elementary OS as my daily driver. And, as I said earlier, I&#x27;m a developer. After looking for a native text editor I made myself think to make Norka. But, this article is about the distinct application.

                    <span>Merhabalar, bu yazıda Linux sistemlerde yeni bir kullanıcı oluşturmayı, oluşturduğumuz kullanıcıya şifre atamayı, root yetkisi vermeyi ve yetkilerini görüntülemeyi inceleyeceğiz. İyi okumalar :)
Yeni bir kullanıcı oluşturmak için;
sudo useradd 

komutu kullanılır.

Oluşturulan kullanıcıya şifre atamak için;
sudo passwd 

komutu kullanılır.

Tüm kullanıcıların görüntüleyebileceği dosyalar, çalıştırabileceği komutlar olduğu gibi sadece root yetkisine sahip kullanıcıların görüntüleyebileceği dosyalar ve çalıştırabileceği komutlar da vardır.
Oluşturduğumuz kullanıcıya, 

Bir kullanıcı root yetkisine sahip olduğunda istediği bütün işlemleri gerçekleştirebilir. Sistemi daha esnek ve güvenli kullanmak için root yetkisi verirken dikkatli olmalıyız. Root yetkisine sahip kullanıcıları;
cat /etc/sudoers
dosyası altında görüntüleyebiliriz.
Bu dosyayı düzenlemek için ;
sudo visudo 

komutu kullanılır.

Komutu çalıştırıp, rootun bulunduğu kısmın altına,
 ALL&#x3D;(ALL)    ALL

satırını ekleyerek kendi kullanıcımıza bütün izinleri vererek, kullanıcımıza root yetkisi vermiş oluruz.

Bir kullanıcının hangi yetkilere sahip olduğunu görmek için; 
sudo -l 
komutu kullanılır.</span>

I&#x27;ve always been using i3wm, but by my friend&#x27;s suggestion, decided to try Wayland. Sway is a WM for Wayland that is similar to i3.
It uses a similar tool to i3bar called swaybar and both have a JSON protocol that allows some more advanced configurations. I aim to set something with mouse control.
Online I&#x27;ve seen some people creating a script that prints to stdout some string and that would be their status line.
~/.config/sway/config, we have this section
bar {
    ...
    status_command while date +&#x27;%Y-%m-%d %l:%M:%S %p&#x27;; do sleep 1; done

                    <span>Your terminal can do some really cool things. The | operator was a stroke of genius. It lets you take the output of one command and feed it to another, chaining together a few simple tools to perform a bigger automated task.
Shell scripts are a natural extension of your terminal&#x27;s power. Creating ready-to-run recipes for later use? Sweet. But once you start using these scripts for more advanced things, you run into some unfortunate Bash quirks. For example: when a part of your script produces an error, the rest of the script will still be executed, making its behavior unpredictable.
There are some habits that you can adopt right now to make writing shell scripts easier.




Here&#x27;s the gist of it if you don&#x27;t need further explanation:
Add set -euo pipefail to improve how your script deals with undeclared variables and non-zero exit codes.
Add IFS&#x3D;$&#x27;\n\t&#x27; so that array elements are split in a predictable way.
When defining functions, return data with echo instead of return. The return keyword doesn&#x27;t do the same thing as in other languages.
Returning arrays from functions is not really possible. As a bad but easy workaround, you can pass array return values via a global variable.
Keep your whitespace in mind. Confusingly, if [ FOO&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x27;bar&#x27; ] will overwrite the value of $FOO. if [ FOO &#x3D; &#x27;bar&#x27; ] will perform a string equality check.
Alternatively, for complex tasks, you&#x27;ll probably have an easier time using a different scripting language like Python, Ruby or Perl.

In this tutorial our GIS application will be based on a PERN app and uses React Leaflet. In case you don’t know what a PERN app is, P stands for Postgres, E for Express, R for React and N for Nodejs.
You’ll need to have Nodejs and Postgres installed, and that’s it ! We can start building our GIS app.
Step 1 : Setting our PERN app
Let’s start with building our server. Open an empty folder on your visual studio code and create a server folder in it.
Inside of the server folder, run using the terminal npm init, after that install your dependencies by running npm i express pg cors
Then create a server.js file inside of the server folder, so your folder structure will be like this :

                    <span>It is not easy to start programming in Python, but it is worth the effort. Some people say that Python is easier to learn than other programming languages because it has less syntactic distinctions.
You can compare Python with other programming languages, but the readability of its code makes it easier for beginners to start their journey in coding. It also has a well-documented syntax that makes it easier for learners to understand the language.You can start learning python from Pythonscholar.com they explain each topic with multiple examples.
Python is one of the most popular programming languages that can be learnt by anyone. It is especially popular for scientific computing and data science due to its simplicity.
Python was created in 1991 by Guido von Rossum. It has an easy syntax with which you can write up to 100 lines of code without needing to use curly brackets {} at the end of each line.For more dept about python history you guys can refer this artical in what is python.
The environment for Python is cross-platform, so if you are working on Linux or Windows, you will find Python coding very similar to what you are used to. The downside is that it takes longer than other languages like C++ or Java, but once you learn it, Python will become your favorite language because it&#x27;s flexible and able to solve many problems that many other languages cannot.

Python is a very powerful and popular programming language. It is used in websites, games, and even the International Space Station!
Python is easy to learn for beginners because it has a simple syntax and gets rid of the need for semicolons. Python also doesn&#x27;t require any import statements when writing programs.</span>

                    <span>Backstory


Have you ever experience difficulties in software development due to unsupported / different version ? Recently I was facing the same issue. The issue was a different Node.js version from my machine (Node v14.18.0) with my company project repository (Node v10 required). The first solution that instantly pop up in my mind was &quot;I think downgrade my current node by uninstalling it will do the work&quot;, But what if you need another version for another project in the near future? Do you want to endure the pain of installing and uninstalling Node.js every time you need a different version of it ? 

NVM is a version manager for Node.js, it allows you to quickly install and use different versions of node via the command line.
Let&#x27;s head to the tutorial !
If you happen to use UNIX, macOS, or WSL (Window Sub-system for Linux), you can install and read the official documentation here
If you happen to use Windows you can install it at NVM for windows which is developed by Corey Butler, download the nvm-setup.zip file.
 

After the installation you can open your command prompt and check whether nvm is recognized
C:\Users\YourUsername&gt;nvm -v

Running version 1.1.8.

If nvm is not recognized as internal command or external command, try to re-open your command prompt.
Then, You can type nvm list in order to see list of Node.js version on your machine.
C:\Users\YourUsername&gt;nvm list

  * 14.18.0 (Currently using 64-bit executable)
    10.18.0

If you don&#x27;t see your desired Node.js version in the list, you can use nvm install command, for example if you want Node.js version 8, you can type nvm install 8.0.0
To use the installed Node.js version you can simply type nvm use 8.0.0
If you see an error message exit status 5: Access is denied., It is due to admin privilege issue. To solve it you can simply run your command prompt as administrator. 
Thank you for your time reading this short article / tutorial about Node Version Manager, hope it helps! and Have a great day.</span>

                    <span>Introduction.


GIMP is very useful, but sometimes doing not well. Or you find a way to capture screenshots via CLI, but the way using xwd command does not work.
In such a case, this article might be your friend.
This article provides you the way to capture screenshots using xwininfo and ImageMagick.
As previous, xwininfo and import of ImageMagick are required.
On Debian and Ubuntu, it needs to install x11-utils and imagemagick packages. To install these, run:
sudo apt install x11-utils imagemagick

Now, we are ready to do!
xwininfo.


To get &quot;Window ID&quot;, run following command in a terminal:
xwininfo

Immediately prompts shown like following:

Select the window you want to capture by clicking a mouse. Then information of the selected window is displayed following the prompt.

The most important is the first line including &quot;Window id: ...&quot;. So the hexadecimal is a Window ID. In the previous example, Window ID is 0x4000001!
import.


To capture a screenshot of the selected window using import command, it needs to pass &quot;Window ID&quot; with -window option.
Run:
import -window 0x4000001 screenshot.jpg

Finally, the screenshot is saved in the current directory!

I will show you &quot;How to capture the whole desktop&quot; by CLI. 
Passing root keyword to -window option:
import -window root screenshot_whole_desktop.jpg

Enjoy!</span>

                    <span>To check if a string is empty in a Bash script, use the -z conditional which returns 0 (true) if the length of the string is 0 and 1 (false) if it is greater than 0.
myVar&#x3D;&quot;hello&quot;

if [[-z &quot;$myVar&quot;]]; then
    echo &quot;myVar is empty&quot;
else
    echo &quot;myVar is not empty&quot;
fi


Alternatively, you can check if a bash string is NOT empty using -n and take the opposite using !.
myVar&#x3D;&quot;&quot;

if [[! -n &quot;$myVar&quot;]]; then
    echo &quot;myVar is empty&quot;
else
    echo &quot;myVar is not empty&quot;
fi

Hello and welcome to this week&#x27;s review. I am your host Habdul Hazeez.
This week&#x27;s review is mostly about computer security in general with a story about money linked to ransomware and another about a fake &quot;security company&quot;
Let&#x27;s begin.
US links $5.2 billion worth of Bitcoin transactions to ransomware


What a time to be alive.
The interesting thing about this story? It&#x27;s all computer code.
Excerpt from the article:
FinCEN identified 177 CVC (convertible virtual currency) wallet addresses used for ransomware-related payments after analyzing 2,184 SARs (Suspicious Activity Reports) filed between January 1, 2011, and June 30, 2021, and reflecting $1.56 billion in suspicious activity

                    <span>It&#x27;s cybersecurity awareness month and we all should be doing out part to #BeCyberSmart. 
The one thing I see people struggling with the most is using passwords and I get it.
A lot of what we&#x27;ve been subjected too about passwords is wrong and actually makes things less secure. Making matters worse, security folks—myself included!—aren&#x27;t known as being the most communicative.
So, I set out to demystify passwords. In the video above 👆, I walk through how passwords are attacked, the UX around them, what makes a truly strong password, and finally I lay out a practical path for dealing with the mishmash of systems out there.
Here in this post, I&#x27;ll give you the highlights...

APIs are becoming crucial to modern app development. Therefore making sure that the data you pass between your APIs is secure and not compromised is a priority.
Unfortunately, APIs face a number of threats such as SQL injection, Cross-site scripting (XSS), Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), Man-in-the-middle (MitM), and Credential stuffing.
The best way to avoid these attacks and improve your API security is to follow some simple best practices.
Prioritize security
Encrypt your data
Share as little as possible
Authentication
Limit the number of messages
Data validation
API firewalling
API gateway (API management)
Monitoring: Audit, log, and version
Infrastructure

In this tutorial, I will walk you through a complete example of creating a single page application using Angular that will connect a server-side ASP.NET Core 5 Web API to fetch data from a SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core (Code First). At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to display some useful stats related to football players.

When you want to build your own Design System on top of Angular Material (or pretty much any other 3rd party component library), you have a couple of options:

Build a custom Angular Material theme and build your own component library on top of Angular Material by wrapping their components in your own components.
There are pros and cons with both approaches. That is a topic for another post so I’m not going into the details here. Long story short, we went wi…</span>
