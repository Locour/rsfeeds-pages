                    <span>Web apps are inevitable. In a tech world filled with mobile apps, people still use web apps. Although the growth of web apps is slower than mobile apps, web apps hold a discrete place in the business world. Not all business apps can be turned into mobile apps. Because Web apps enrich the business with unique features that will be compatible only with web platforms. Yes! Mobile apps are handy, but it is hard to fit in reports and other salient features into them. I an era when the usage of mobile phones is higher than web apps, business owners still prefer web apps over mobile apps to work smoothly.
Web Application Development
Web app development is the creation of app programs that reside in remote servers. They are delivered to the users with the help of the internet. Most of the web apps are written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Web app development comprises of front-end and back-end.
Importance of NodeJS Developers in Real-time Web App Development:
NodeJS developers are the ones who have the potency to develop large scale web apps with scalability and high-performance. It should be noted that real-time apps need two-way connections. NodeJS is the solution that helps business owners to develop real-time web apps with ease. In addition, developers with good programming skills can make the server and client to exchange data and communicate freely.
If you are looking forward to developing real-time web apps, it is about time to hire NodeJS developers. Moreover, they will be a valuable asset to your company and will transform any dreams into cost-effective apps. Here are a few points that state the importance of NodeJS developers in developing Real-time apps.
NodeJS developers have the ability to build faster and real-time apps that of high-demand now.

                    <span>Developing high-performing web Apps is the easiest way for a business to achieve an excellent online presence. Web Apps can perform all the necessary functions utilizing a web browser which evades the need for installed software. Also, it has the power to use numerous platforms and avoid restrictions like App store memberships, fees, etc, unlike mobile Apps. 
To develop a world-class web App, Javascript frameworks like Node.js, AngularJS come into play. But which one is the best? Node.js or AngularJS?
Efficient Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, reusable components, end-to-end integration testing are some of the primary reasons behind the popularity &amp; success of AngularJS technology.

As one of the biggest code hosting platforms available today, GitHub provides numerous ways for developers to integrate with the platform. One of those integration options is GitHub webhooks.
In this article, we are going to explore GitHub webhooks. We will look at what a GitHub webhook is, and how to set it up on our GitHub account. Further, we will explore a sample API that receives and logs webhook events. This API will run on our local development environment, thus we will be receiving the webhooks on our local machine. However, if you have a local API you would rather use, feel free to follow along with the article.

Here&#x27;s the steps we are about to take:
Author script. First you need to create a script. In this case we are creating a script, but you can also create and upload a module to PowerShell gallery.
Document it. When you document your script, you do so, so Get-Help will work with it, this is highly recommended to do.
Prepare the package. To be able to upload your script, it needs a specific set of metadata, there are commands that will help you do that.
Sign up for PowerShell gallery. It&#x27;s free to sign up for the gallery, but what you do need from it is an API key that will help you publish yo…</span>

                    <span>What about implementing a full automated #NoOps solution? I have done this setup in minutes thanks to kubernetesio, Shipa and github actions. 
NoOps trend is now possible thanks to public cloud and services that give us solution that works out of the box. Anyway, many of these services come with some limitations or have costs that explode with resource usage. That’s why a lot of developers still prefer solutions like Kubernetes for keeping control over the application and having full freedom for implementation. Anyway, Kubernetes governance is expensive and we aim to reduce the friction near the application development.

This post covers how idempotency keys are used in Medusa and how you can implement your own idempotency key logic in a NodeJS application to make your API more robust. This post and the implementation discussed here are inspired by this article by Brandur.
Idempotence is a mathematical term used to describe algebraic expressions that remain invariant when raised to a natural power - the word itself comes from the Latin words idem and potence meaning same and power respectively. In software and tech idempotency typically refers to the idea that you can perform an operation multiple times without triggering any side effects more than once. This is an extremely powerful property for fault tolerance in larger systems where service availability cannot be guaranteed. If you are fa…</span>

                    <span>🔍 OWASP has issued an update to its list of the top web app security threats. We&#x27;ll look at the changes and how they impact your web application environment.



  
  
  
October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month. On top of that, OWASP just celebrated its 20th anniversary. To celebrate, we’re going to run through the newly updated OWASP TOP 10 to remind everyone of how you can better protect your applications, your businesses, and your customers from unlawful and damaging cyber attacks. We’ll also be highlighting where the updates were made and why and throw in some tips on how strengthening your identity solution can help mitigate these threats.
The new Top 10 is still a working draft, and OWASP is soliciting feedback on errors and corrections.
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organization that was set up to help raise awareness around web application security and provides guidance on how to incorporate preventative measures into your applications, infrastructure, and internal processes.  
They have several projects, including an insecure JavaScript application used for security training, but the one that we’re focusing on today is the newly updated 2021 edition of their list of the top 10 threats to web app security.  
Updated regularly, the OWASP Top 10 lists the main security threats that affect web applications today. Each entry enumerates the threat, shows possible attack vectors, and highlights preventive measures to reduce the risk of such threat. At Auth0, we take steps to mitigate most of the issues outlined below, so when you delegate your authentication needs to us, a lot of this is already taken care of for you.
Let’s run through the list, looking at the threats and what we could be doing to make sure our own applications are secure and examining some features of the Auth0 platform that help to mitigate or entirely remove such threats.
For a high-level overview of the list updates, please refer to this handy chart, provided by OWASP:

                    <span>Overview


Imagine if Amazon were unavailable for just one day each year. At that rate, they would have 99.7% availability, which seems fairly reasonable on the surface. In 2020, however, Amazon&#x27;s revenue was nearly $400 billion. Living with 99.7% availability instead of 100% would cost Amazon more than $1 billion. Downtime—even just a little—will cost your business.
We minimize downtime through redundancy. Building reliable systems out of unreliable components requires having spare components to replace the faulty ones. Still, though, it takes time to replace faulty components.
Now, let&#x27;s take it to the realm of software. You have an enterprise-grade system with tens of thousands (or more) of servers and applications. Those are spread across the globe. You need to deploy your applications…</span>

Why Node.js?
Node.js is an open-source runtime environment based on JavaScript. It lets developers build and execute the code on the server-side. This enables to speed up the development. Moreover, it has vast libraries, frameworks, and other app development tools. Thus, this eliminates the need for different languages.
Also, its robust ecosystem package manager helps to achieve impressive speed and multi-user proficiency. Business giants like Microsoft, IBM, Netflix, PayPal, LinkedIn, eBay, Uber, etc use Node.js to power their tech Stacks.

Yeah, with some caveats. But before I disclose those, you probably think that I&#x27;m insane for even presenting the idea that you can run VS Code on Android. And you&#x27;re wrong, sorta.
VS Code is targeted at desktop operating systems, such as Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux distributions. There aren&#x27;t explicit &quot;Android&quot; (much less mobile) versions of VS Code. So we can&#x27;t just install it via the Google Play Store or a 3rd party app store like any other app. Rather, we have to run it in a Linux container.
I won&#x27;t go into the details of creating a Linux container in this post, but you can check out my Guide to replacing a laptop with Android: Part 2 article for information on how to do that.

First you have the bin directory which contains binaries or executables that are essential to the
We also have a (usr) user directory with its own bin and s-bin directories; the binaries or applications here are non-essential to the operating system itself and intended for the end user.
You&#x27;ll also notice a local directory
All these binaries get mapped together with the path environment variable and that&#x27;s why you can execute them from any directory in the terminal if you ever want to know where a binary lives.
At some point you may want to customize the behavior of the software on your system
Many of the files in etc end in conf and they&#x27;re typically just text-based config files that you can modify in your editor (I prefer VIM) as an operating system.
Let&#x27;s go back to the root: there are a few more directories here like:
boot: it contains the files needed
dev which stands for device files: here you can interface with hardware or drivers as if they were regular files, you might create disk partitions here or interface with your floppy drive
the op directory contains optional or
var contains variable files that will change
temp is for temporary files
and finally we have the weirdest one of

  Sysmon in a nutshell:


Sysmon (System Monitor) is a Windows system service that logs system activity to the Windows event log. Now, it is available for Linux too! 
It was developed by Microsoft as an open source project. Even though it is doubtful to see such a contribution, I am very glad about it 🤭

So, I made a python script that connects to a Chromecast and plays video &amp; audio (.mp4 || .mp3) as soon as you drop your file in the chromecast folder...
The idea came when I was looking for a quick way to share files onto my TV or Google Home Max without having to need a dedicated app. So, I hacked the b*tch!
On a serious note...
 
 
A. Know the &quot;friendly&quot; name of your TV (CASDROP_TV_NAME) and Speaker (CASDROP_SPKR_NAME). 
B. Make sure your machine is running python ~&gt; 3.9.7 (not mandatory, but you need at least python 3).
C. Install all dependencies to run this program: pip install requirements.txt
 
 
Step1. Open a new terminal on your unix/linux based computer 
NOTE: I ran these commands in a BASH environment, so I suggest doing the same...
 
Step2. Open params.sh and edit the  with your own values. I ran into a few mistakes because I was putting in the wrong IP address.
 
Step3. Run the following command in your terminal:
ONLY RUN THIS ONCE!
bash params.sh #you may need to run this command with elevated privileges
 
Step4. Run the app:
1. Start a simple HTTP server:
    &#x60;python -m SimpleHTTPServer&#x60;

2. Run the casting service: 
    &#x60;python3 casdrop.py&#x60;

3. Drop a file in your watch &#x60;CASDROP_WATCH_FOLDER&#x60; folder. Which in this case should be the folder we are looking to drop our files.

 


**At this point, your uploaded files should start streaming on the device(s).**

 
 
CASDROP_WATCH_FOLDER &#x3D;&gt; A folder you drop files in, to cast to device(s)


CASDROP_SERVER_URL &#x3D;&gt; The IP address you get from SimpleHTTPServer a.k.a (http://)


CASDROP_SPKR_NAME and CASDROP_TV_NAME&#x3D;&gt; Displayed name of devices with (Ussually shown in cast menu on YouTube or Spotify mobile app)




  
  
  Here&#x27;s my sample param.sh file

Currently you can drop a .mp3 or .mp4 which will cast with zero problem. However, I plan on adding more features down

Even if you&#x27;re developing JS for the browser, a streamlined development process will probably involve using Node to do some tasks for you. Different projects may require different Node runtimes/versions to be built, and developers are probably working on several different projects on their local machines at a time that may require …</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(3 min)</span>
                    <span>console.log is useful in a lot of situations (although there are usually better ways to debug if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing).
In the browser console.log works well with objects, you can drill down as much as you need. But in Node.js, when you look at the output of a nested object, you&#x27;ll often see this:
$ console.log({a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}})

{ a: { b: { c: [Object] } } }

d: {} was replaced with [Object]. But why?
It&#x27;s because the command line / terminal doesn&#x27;t have a nice UI for drilling down, so Node attempts to print up to three levels deep. Beyond three levels it just prints [Object].
This is controlled by a variable in the node &#x27;util&#x27; module, called depth, which defaults to 2. You can set it yourself here:
require(&#x27;util&#x27;).inspect.defaultOptions.depth &#x3D; 0; // top level only, e.g.:
// { a: [Object] }
require(&#x27;util&#x27;).inspect.defaultOptions.depth &#x3D; null; // print everything, e.g.: 
// {
//  a: { b: { c: { d: {} } } }
// }

It&#x27;s not a great idea to change an underlying variable, as it might come back to bite later. So a cleaner way is to convert the JSON object to a string and log that. We can use node&#x27;s built in JSON class and the stringify method:
complexObject &#x3D; {a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}}
console.log(JSON.stringify(complexObject, null, 2))

// {
//   &quot;a&quot;: {
//     &quot;b&quot;: {
//       &quot;c&quot;: {
//         &quot;d&quot;: {}
//       }
//     }
//   }
// }

Note that the 3rd parameter of JSON.stringify, Number 2, controls the number of spaces of indentation, and the 2nd parameter can be used to filter or adjust the objects and properties shown.
Now you can really see what&#x27;s in those deep Objects.</span>

I have an index.js file where I load all my express middleware etc, and some router files for specific routes. The websocket connection should be initialised outside the router so I dont open a new one every time. Should I create an on connection listener in the index.js file and outsource all the emits to a different file, or should the whole socket server live inside a different file?


I know that socketio needs an http server to work, but I cannot pass an exress server in its constructor. Should I use an http server for my server instead and use express as a request handler? Or should I create a new http server for my websocket connection?


Should I create a different socket server for the server/angular and raspberry/server communication (I will need to store the socketID and token/id of the raspberry in a map to know which raspberry I should send the data to) or should I use the same server with different rooms?



I apologise if those questions are too basic, I have never really worked with websockets so I dont know about the best practices when working with them. I want to do everything as clean as possible.</span>

We have handled http calls, http retries, Idempotency, consistent request and response structures and many more.This way you get to focus on your business logic rather than figuring out how the FreshBooks API works. 
Prerequisites 
A FreshBooks Developer account. If you don&#x27;t have one, you can create one here.
Authenticate yourself on the FreshBooks API using Oauth2.0. No idea how to do that? No problem, we have an excellent tutorial here.
Basic knowledge of Async, Await and Node.js.
A code editor (e.g. VS Code, Sublime, Atom etc.)
Let&#x27;s get started!
In your Node project directory, install the FreshBooks NodeJs Client via npm or yarn
npm install @freshbooks/api 

yarn install @freshbooks/api

                    <span>Well, hello!
dotenv. However, when writing backend with, Expressjs, for instance, you have to initialize it like so:-
require(&#x27;dotenv&#x27;).config({path: &#x27;./.env&#x27;});

A friend was building an API with Expressjs. He needed to connect to stripe for the payments. The response from stripe was Authorization headers are missing. He couldn&#x27;t get why this was happening despite the fact that he had defined the Stripe Secret Key on the environment variables (.env), and used it when initializing &quot;stripe&quot; npm package. 
..
const stripeRoute &#x3D;  require(&quot;./routes/stripe&quot;)
..
require(&#x27;dotenv&#x27;).config({path: &#x27;./.env&#x27;});
..

const stripe &#x3D; require(&quot;stripe&quot;)(process.env.STRIPE_KEY);

STRIPE_KEY&#x3D;key_goes_here

The error was as a result of defining the Stripe routes before requiring the .env. This solved his issue:
require(&#x27;dotenv&#x27;).config({path: &#x27;./.env&#x27;});

const stripeRoute &#x3D;  require(&quot;./routes/stripe&quot;)


Personally I like to define my environment variables at the start of the server file.</span>

                    <span>Intro


Platforms like Slack, Teams, and Discord have become much more than just a communication mechanism. In the world of remote work, these platforms become the very venue through which our teams operate.
In this tutorial, we&#x27;re going to be using NodeJS to create a Slack Bot which you can customize to handle HR operations, pull data, or just create a more enjoyable slack experience for your team.
If you&#x27;re interested in learning how to create bots on other communication platforms, let us know down below.
Our project file system is going to be relatively simple. We&#x27;re just going to need a standard node project which we can initialize with:
npm init
Let&#x27;s then add Slack&#x27;s Bolt API for creating Slack Apps:
npm i @slack/bolt
Finally, create a file called index.js

All the used for this app is MEAN stack
MongoDB used for storing data of users, short URLs and some other stats.
Redis used for maintaining user sessions.
Amazon SQS helped in counting stats.
Angular for front-end and all other normal stuff.

                    <span>Web apps are inevitable. In a tech world filled with mobile apps, people still use web apps. Although the growth of web apps is slower than mobile apps, web apps hold a discrete place in the business world. Not all business apps can be turned into mobile apps. Because Web apps enrich the business with unique features that will be compatible only with web platforms. Yes! Mobile apps are handy, but it is hard to fit in reports and other salient features into them. I an era when the usage of mobile phones is higher than web apps, business owners still prefer web apps over mobile apps to work smoothly.
Web Application Development
Web app development is the creation of app programs that reside in remote servers. They are delivered to the users with the help of the internet. Most of the web apps are written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Web app development comprises of front-end and back-end.
Importance of NodeJS Developers in Real-time Web App Development:
NodeJS developers are the ones who have the potency to develop large scale web apps with scalability and high-performance. It should be noted that real-time apps need two-way connections. NodeJS is the solution that helps business owners to develop real-time web apps with ease. In addition, developers with good programming skills can make the server and client to exchange data and communicate freely.
If you are looking forward to developing real-time web apps, it is about time to hire NodeJS developers. Moreover, they will be a valuable asset to your company and will transform any dreams into cost-effective apps. Here are a few points that state the importance of NodeJS developers in developing Real-time apps.
NodeJS developers have the ability to build faster and real-time apps that of high-demand now.

                    <span>Businesses use call forwarding all the time to route incoming calls to available agents, extensions, or departments that cater to the caller’s needs. Creating a call forwarding app is simple when you use Plivo’s Node.js SDK. This guide shows you how to receive incoming calls on Plivo numbers and manage the call flow once a call reaches the Plivo voice platform. To see how to do this, we’ll build an Express.js application to forward the call to a mobile number using the Dial XML element.
Before you get started, you’ll need:
  A Plivo account — sign up for one for free if you don’t have one already.
A voice-enabled Plivo phone number if you want to receive incoming calls. To search for and buy an available number, go to Phone Numbers &gt; Buy Numbers on the Plivo console.

                    <span>🔍 OWASP has issued an update to its list of the top web app security threats. We&#x27;ll look at the changes and how they impact your web application environment.



  
  
  
October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month. On top of that, OWASP just celebrated its 20th anniversary. To celebrate, we’re going to run through the newly updated OWASP TOP 10 to remind everyone of how you can better protect your applications, your businesses, and your customers from unlawful and damaging cyber attacks. We’ll also be highlighting where the updates were made and why and throw in some tips on how strengthening your identity solution can help mitigate these threats.
The new Top 10 is still a working draft, and OWASP is soliciting feedback on errors and corrections.
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organization that was set up to help raise awareness around web application security and provides guidance on how to incorporate preventative measures into your applications, infrastructure, and internal processes.  
They have several projects, including an insecure JavaScript application used for security training, but the one that we’re focusing on today is the newly updated 2021 edition of their list of the top 10 threats to web app security.  
Updated regularly, the OWASP Top 10 lists the main security threats that affect web applications today. Each entry enumerates the threat, shows possible attack vectors, and highlights preventive measures to reduce the risk of such threat. At Auth0, we take steps to mitigate most of the issues outlined below, so when you delegate your authentication needs to us, a lot of this is already taken care of for you.
Let’s run through the list, looking at the threats and what we could be doing to make sure our own applications are secure and examining some features of the Auth0 platform that help to mitigate or entirely remove such threats.
For a high-level overview of the list updates, please refer to this handy chart, provided by OWASP:

                    <span>console.log is useful in a lot of situations (although there are usually better ways to debug if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing).
In the browser console.log works well with objects, you can drill down as much as you need. But in Node.js, when you look at the output of a nested object, you&#x27;ll often see this:
$ console.log({a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}})

{ a: { b: { c: [Object] } } }

d: {} was replaced with [Object]. But why?
It&#x27;s because the command line / terminal doesn&#x27;t have a nice UI for drilling down, so Node attempts to print up to three levels deep. Beyond three levels it just prints [Object].
This is controlled by a variable in the node &#x27;util&#x27; module, called depth, which defaults to 2. You can set it yourself here:
require(&#x27;util&#x27;).inspect.defaultOptions.depth &#x3D; 0; // top level only, e.g.:
// { a: [Object] }
require(&#x27;util&#x27;).inspect.defaultOptions.depth &#x3D; null; // print everything, e.g.: 
// {
//  a: { b: { c: { d: {} } } }
// }

It&#x27;s not a great idea to change an underlying variable, as it might come back to bite later. So a cleaner way is to convert the JSON object to a string and log that. We can use node&#x27;s built in JSON class and the stringify method:
complexObject &#x3D; {a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}}
console.log(JSON.stringify(complexObject, null, 2))

// {
//   &quot;a&quot;: {
//     &quot;b&quot;: {
//       &quot;c&quot;: {
//         &quot;d&quot;: {}
//       }
//     }
//   }
// }

Note that the 3rd parameter of JSON.stringify, Number 2, controls the number of spaces of indentation, and the 2nd parameter can be used to filter or adjust the objects and properties shown.
Now you can really see what&#x27;s in those deep Objects.</span>

Event processing is one of the common implementations when building TypeScript applications.
Registering an event as well as executing some actions when an event has been triggered requires an Observable pattern, which provides a unidirectional flow to streams of events, making debugging and error handling with event streams a lot easier.
In this article, we will explore Observables, how they are used to handle event-driven data, and errors and asynchronous data.
 Introduction to Observables
 Observable operators
 Transforming arrays with Observable
 Combining multiple operators for event stream transformation
 Handling errors with Observables
One of the interesting, but sometimes brain-teasing, parts of JavaScript in general is handling events.

O artigo é sobre a relação da versão anterior do Vue com o Typescript e como contornar alguns problemas de escopo da melhor forma o possível baseado nas minhas experiências
Acho que alguns de vocês tem reparado em alguns erros de TS que podem vir a acontecer nas versões 2.x no Vue. Mas por que  acontece?
O Vue 2.x tem um escopo que dependendo da forma que utilizar o TS dentro do projeto o próprio Typescript (que é um superset de Javascipt) tem dificuldade de interpretar/fazer leitura dessas props dentro das funções. Esse cenário ocorre bastante quando usamos alguma prop como retorno dentro do mounted() ou computed(), por exemplo.

I&#x27;ve recently been playing around writing some smart contracts for fun with Solidity and the fastest way to validate the logic you wrote works as what you expect it to do is by unit testing. It was also a fun experiencing testing smart contracts with Chai and Mocha together with TypeScript. It made things quick and easy for me. And cheers to Hardhat for making things much more easier and convenient that it automatically generates all the TypeScript typings of a smart contract via Typechain. In this article we&#x27;re only going to cover how we set it up using Hardhat and how we can make those assertions. 
But why should we unit test our smart contracts? Can&#x27;t we just deploy it manually using the Hardhat deploy script and from the UI we can point-click and test it from there? Yes, we …</span>

When you want to build your own Design System on top of Angular Material (or pretty much any other 3rd party component library), you have a couple of options:
Build a custom Angular Material theme and use the components as they are described in the documentation.
Build a custom Angular Material theme and build your own component library on top of Angular Material by wrapping their components in your own components.

                    <span>📘 The new Auth0 #ASP.NET Core Authentication SDK makes adding authentication and authorization to your web applications a breeze. Learn how.



  
  
  
Auth0 brings you the new ASP.NET Core Authentication SDK, which improves your development experience and better integrates with Auth0 features! Let&#x27;s take a tour through the main features of the SDK to see how easy it becomes to integrate your ASP.NET applications with Auth0.
So far, you were used to relying on the standard Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect package to integrate your ASP.NET application with Auth0. That library does its job very well. However, when you move away from implementing the simple login and logout, your code starts becoming verbose until it gets messy.

                    <span>There are two perspectives (at least) in every web scraping story: one of the website being scraped and the other of the scraper itself. In this article, we’ll talk about this relationship using a specific example. On one side, there’s Bax Shop, a website selling and renting musical equipment. On the other, there’s Price2Spy – an advanced web crawler, looking to monitor prices on Bax Shop.
We’ll start off by talking about how Bax Shop came to be and give you a glimpse into its roots. Then we’ll focus on the period when they first launched their online store and how initially they fought bots on their website. Afterward, we’ll go over other methods they employed and also cover how Price2Spy adapted to these defenses, in this back-and-forth game of price monitoring.

                    <span>I believe every developer deserves amazing collaboration tools for managing secrets. Using a secrets manager shouldn&#x27;t come at the cost of a brain aneurysm. In fact, I think a platform designed for developers of all backgrounds can bring moments of joy to your day, promote healthy security hygiene, and boost your overall developer productivity. Doppler was built from the ground up because the Universal Secrets Platform (USP) I needed simply didn&#x27;t exist. 
I am sure at this point you may be asking who are you? What is a secret - sounds mysterious? What is a USP? How does it differ from a traditional secrets manager or even a dotenv file? Lots of questions, I’ll start off with a simple one - who am I.

Formerly known as ripple-lib, the library was renamed to better represent its role in the XRPL ecosystem and overhauled to take advantage of modern JavaScript features.
JavaScript is one of the most widely-used programming languages, and as such has a massive community of active developers. Maintaining a JavaScript SDK enables these developers to seamlessly interact with the XRP Ledger, both in the browser and in Node.js. In addition, the JavaScript libraries (xrpl.js, ripple-binary-codec, ripple-keypairs, and ripple-address-codec) power many apps in the XRPL ecosystem, as well as packages from companies such as BitGo and L…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


This article will explain the implementation details of the Select all functionality in the multi-select component based on the react-select v5.1.0 package. 





  
  
  handleChange function


The primary logic of the &quot;Select all&quot; option has been implemented in this function. 
All the elements in the list are selected.
Some of the options in the menu are selected
None of the options is selected.
The first case happens under certain conditions: the current state of the Select all option is unchecked, the length of the selected elements is greater than zero, meanwhile, either the Select all option or all the options in the menu except the Select all option are selected. If these conditions are met, then all the elements in the menu are checked. 
Select all option nor all of …</span>

                    <span>Lets say we have the following simple function:
const even &#x3D; (a: number) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (a % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 0) {
    return a
  }
  throw new Error(&#x60;value: ${a} is even&#x60;);
}

as you can see if the value is even we return the number else we throw an error. The normal way of handling this would be to wrap it inside a try-catch and handle the error. But when you have multiple functions this becomes tedious and error-prone.
In the fp world instead of throwing errors all over the place, we convert them to data. This in typescript would look something like this:
type Try &#x3D; Success | Failure

where Success is a container that wraps some value of type A and Failure is the alternative one that contains the error.
Let’s try to implement this structure! We will use a mix of OOP and FP, to create nicely chain…</span>

                    <span>This is the rule of calling hooks:
Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns.
For the usage in HOC like below taken from https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk/blob/e2f79f1c156e5e82f70cd88fd2bf22dc3be8ecad/src/withLDConsumer.tsx#L43:
function withLDConsumer(options: ConsumerOptions &#x3D; { clientOnly: false }) {
  return function withLDConsumerHoc(WrappedComponent: React.ComponentType) {
    return (props: P) &#x3D;&gt; (
      
        {({ flags, ldClient }: LDContext) &#x3D;&gt; {
          if (options.clientOnly) {
            return ;
          }

          return ;
        }}
      
    );
  };
}


Can I use hooks in the returned anonymous function, like below?
function withLDConsumer(options: ConsumerOptions &#x3D; { clientOnly: false }) {
  return function withLDConsumerHoc(WrappedComponent: React.ComponentType) {
    return (props: P) &#x3D;&gt; (
      const [name, setName] &#x3D; useState(&#x27;Mary&#x27;); 
      
        {({ flags, ldClient }: LDContext) &#x3D;&gt; {
          if (options.clientOnly) {
            return ;
          }

          return ;
        }}
      
    );
  };
}

I think it is a &quot;always use Hooks at the top level of your React function&quot;, but my friend said it is a &quot;nested function&quot;. My understanding to this is that this &quot;nest&quot; should only count from the function component level.</span>

Mehrzahl is a little npm module to format parts of a template string in singular or plural. Here is the npm page and this is how it works:
import { mz } from &quot;mehrzahl&quot;
const str &#x3D; mz(3)&#x60;There {is|are} $value bird{|s} at the park.&#x60;
// str &#x3D; &quot;There are 3 birds at the park.&quot;

The issue I worked on was to add a reverse usage of the mz utility (and calling it zm) to accomplish this:
import { zm } from &quot;mehrzahl&quot;
const template &#x3D; zm&#x60;There {was|were} $value bird{|s} at the park.&#x60;
template(5) // There were 5 birds at the park.
template(1) // There was 1 bird at the park.

                    <span>One of the things no programming course explicitly teaches about is naming patterns. This happens because there is no such thing as a universal standard when it comes to naming conventions. 
Of course some languages will have some well known general guidelines, PEP-8 for Python, while other languages will have some general guidelines which are not set in stone but usually produce good practical results. 
For example, with TypeScript:
Classes, and Interfaces/Types must be in PascalCase;
Exported strings/constants should be in UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE;
Methods and functions should be in camelCase();
And so on...
However, when it comes to naming conventions it may vary from project to project, and things can get messy when a developer has &quot;tunnel vision&quot;.

Effects are a powerful model for handling side effects in your application. Commonly this means when you are making a HTTP request in a NgRx powered application you will use an effect to handle the communication with the service but they can do so much more than that. And frankly this is what I usually used them for until I read https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/start-using-ngrx-effects-for-this#handling-the-flow-of-a-angular-material-dialog . 
I became intrigued by the idea of offloading some component material dialog code into the effect and started viewing the life cycle as a series of events and using the effect to talk to other effects.

                    <span>When an entrepreneur launches his mobile app, they want it to be perfect from all the dynamics. When you are building an Angular App, you would not need to take extra precautions about the performance of the front end of your app.
Building an app, especially an Angular Mobile App, will bring several advantages to your table. For instance, its profound Model-view control Architecture and extensive Dependency Injection. 
To build one of your own successful and robust Angular Mobile App, you need to get a basic idea about other angular example Apps to get ahead of this cut-throat competitive market.

                    <span>Time to set up a Linux container on top of Android OS.


This is significantly easier than I expected. Going pack to the zeroth post in this series, I am shocked at how far the community has pushed Android OS to become a desktop replacement OS.
Some of this work was undertaken by corporations. This is most clearly shown by Samsung Dex, a desktop skin of Android that is installed on most of Samsung&#x27;s latest devices. It is still Android under the hood, and it isn&#x27;t perfect either, but it provides a basic, Chromebook-Esque interface to Android. This software package is partly the reason why I chose the Samsung Galaxy S7 Tab as well.
The two apps to start developing in a Linux container on Android OS are:
Termux
AndroidNix
To be honest, you don&#x27;t need AndroidNix to get this working, but it cer…</span>

                    <span>What is traditional desktop software?


It depends on who you ask. To me, it is simply:
Audio and video editing
Document processing
Password managers
Web browsers
Video games
Conference software
Development software
Some might add 3d modeling tools, content streaming tools, or maybe torrenting utilities to this list. But for my day-to-day use on a computer, I interact with these software packages the most.
For this tutorial, I won&#x27;t be covering Development software as I will get more involved in setting up and configuring these software packages on Android in a later tutorial. But I will briefly go over a few repositories that contain useful tools that I intend to use.
I also won&#x27;t be going over the specific tools that I intend to use for everything but development. Everyone has their favorite document processor or PDF reader, no point in trying to convince you otherwise.
Have the Google Play Store installed on your device.
Search for any of the keywords listed above in the Google Play Store search bar.
Profit.
And that&#x27;s it. That is the end of part 1 of this roadmap, which again was to install the &quot;vanilla&quot; software of Android. In the next tutorial, I will go over the development setup that I have done.
But if you want to jump the gun on what software I intend to use, checkout Termux on F-Droid.
Termux is the killer app that allows for desktop-class development to happen on Android OS.

When it comes to security. There is a lot of guidance and also advice and commentary on why you should or should not use each approach. It&#x27;s hard to understand all the different options and security issues they have.
You also have different clients (mobile/web/app) and each has different security requirements for managing, storing and processing data in the form of tokens, cookies or sessions.
At the end, your app may scale and not all options can be deployed as multiple instance nodes without additional changes to the app and infrastructure.
This means that you really need to make decisions at the beginning and ask questions like: What are your customers? and What are your requirements? and What can be added to the system in the future? and How is it poss…</span>

                    <span>Would you like to get notified when someone opens your dev.to article or reads your email? Yea that will be awesome. Okay then lets see how we can do that?
Lets talk about Images they are pretty cool right? Imagers are everywhere including in Articles and Emails.
![alt text](https://yoursite.com/some_image)

Or in HTML you&#x27;d use the image tag


and of course the markdown above is later compiled to HTML So lets focus on that.
So when a webpage have an image the browser will send an http request to the URL which is in the src of the image(https://yoursite.com/some_image in our case).
https://yoursite.com will send us and image which will be later shown to us in browser.
https://yoursite.com/ could look something like this
app.get(&quot;/some_image&quot;, (req, res) &#x3D;&gt; {
     res.sendFile(&#x27;some_image.jpg&#x27;)
})

But the question is, is it that all we can do? Well its our code we can do whatever we want. So why not just notify our self that someone viewed this image?
app.get(&quot;/some_image&quot;, (req, res) &#x3D;&gt; {
     notifyUser() //You can implement it the way you want
     res.sendFile(&#x27;some_image.jpg&#x27;)
})

Now we will be notified whenever a user sees our image. That also means that if we use this image in our article/email we will know when a user opens it/reads it.
So if you&#x27;re seeing this image that means ...</span>

                    <span>RxJS 7 has shipped! For us Angular developers, it unfortunately did not ship in time for Angular 12.
I&#x27;ve summarized key takeaways from Ben Lesh’s talk from RxJS Live Asia and his slides below. Lesh is a member of the RxJS core team and formerly worked at Google on the Angular team.
Lesh said while RxJS 7 was “a bit faster,” the big improvement for the new version is its bundle size. RxJS 7 is 53% the size of RxJS 6. If your app used every operator in version 6, that would require 52 KB, but the same thing in RxJS 7 requires just 19 KB.
“This was done via a refactor, a hundred-point improvement of going around and individually moving around code, keeping the same tests, keeping the same code, and moving things around slowly but surely until we got to a place where we could see daylight and…</span>

                    <span>It’s needless to say that Single-Page Applications (SPA) took over the web development world by storm. Like it or not, SPA frameworks are here to stay, and one of the most popular ones—Angular—will be the topic of this article.
This is what the tutorial covers:
Create an Angular app from scratch using Angular CLI
Build simple CRUD app using Angular components, services, models, and routing
Expand your app’s functionality with feature flags branching by Split
Dive deeper into Split features with event tracking and monitoring
What will the app be about? Hopefully, you’re a sports fan as you’ll be building a simple app to track favorite basketball players!
To follow this tutorial on adding feature flags to your angular app, you should have:

                    <span>For a client project, I had a Summary and Detail Page. The Detail Page was opened in a new tab. They needed the summary to update when the state of the detail information changed.
Having worked with BroadcastChannel in the past (see HERE), I set about creating a service to handle this functionality.
First, I needed an interface ...
export interface BroadcastMessage {
  type: string;
  payload: any;
}

Then, there&#x27;s the code ...
import { Injectable } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;
import { Observable, Subject } from &#x27;rxjs&#x27;;
import { filter } from &#x27;rxjs/operators&#x27;;

                    <span>Have you ever wanted to implement a custom form validator in Angular? 🅰️ It is possible by creating your own validator function.
For our example let’s say we have a social media app 📱 and we want to only ☝️ register users over 16 years old 🧑.
We can simply use the built in 🧰 Validators.min(n) validator for this case, but we are going to create our own custom validator function from scratch ✨

I’m going to be using reactive forms ⚛️ for this example so make sure to import the ReactiveFormsModule in your app.module.ts
// app.module.ts

import { NgModule } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;
import { ReactiveFormsModule } from &#x27;@angular/forms&#x27;; // 👈
