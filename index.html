                    <span>Angular is a framework, while React and Vue are libraries, therefore angular is heavier than the other two, due to its big codebase. The Angular’s core contains most of the functionalities you might need in your application, while with React and Vue, you have to find external libraries, maintained by independent contributors. Therefore, when working with React and Vue, you have to be more careful when choosing libraries, being aware that libraries with a poor maintenance might be deprecated in future.
To build an app with Angular you have to learn Typescript, which is a superset of JavaScript, while with Vue and React you can use pure JS. Regarding the view, with Angular and Vue you write it with HTML, where in React you have to write JSX, which is a syntax that allows coexistence between …</span>

We can insert new records into the database using SQLAlchemy by running.
person &#x3D; Person(name&#x3D;&#x27;Amr&#x27;)


db.session.add(person)


db.session.commit()



which will build a transaction for inserting in a person instance in our model/table, and persist it to the database upon calling commit().
It isn&#x27;t until we execute db.session() that we commit anything to the database.
Every time we want to interact with the database we start a connection and end a connection when all of the interactions are done.
Within that interaction session, We wound up creating transactions that we commit to the database every time that we want to commit work to the database.

We will use Processing Jobs throughout the book to perform data quality checks and feature transformations.
However, in this section we will generate recommendations using SageMaker Processing Jobs with Apache Spark ML’s collaborative filtering algorithm called Alternating Least Squares (ALS).
We would use this algorithm if we already have a Spark-based data pipeline and want to generate recommendations using that pipeline.

                    <span>DevOps is hot right now. It seems like every software engineering job posting requires DevOps experience and expertise regardless of the actual job title.
When a tech company breaks up its monolith into microservices, each of its engineering teams now owns their portion of the application from start to finish. Software engineers no longer just build the application; they also own repo maintenance, set up continuous integration, configure build pipelines, and deploy their application.
In this world of cross-functional teams and microservice architecture, DevOps skills become increasingly important, and that starts with understanding CI/CD (continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment).

                    <span>Jenkins is an open-source and extensible continuous integration and continuous deployment server. It is used to automate the process of continuous integration and continuous deployment(CI/CD). The importance of monitoring remote jobs and interacting with team members for stable code is immense; Jenkins takes care of all these requirements and allows a smooth integration via plugins, pipelines, and Jenkins environment variables.
If you are amongst the typical Jenkins users who want to add to their knowledge about CI and CD, some fundamental concepts must be learned. In this article, we will learn about the critical concept of Jenkins pipeline environment variables.

We all deal with software in everyday life, and it happens that sometimes, a program doesn’t work as expected. In most cases, it is connected with a coding error called a bug.
Why do the bugs appear though and why clients, even though they might hire an experienced team of developers, still have to pay for code with imperfections? Yep, it doesn’t always depend on a developer whether the product is going to function as expected. It depends on many factors, and you better learn more about them if you want to eliminate the possibility of bug occurrence.

                    <span>Over the last few months of working from home on less than optimal hardware, I&#x27;ve had the chance to pick up some interesting tricks, as well as using some that I&#x27;ve picked up before, while working on remote servers. Here&#x27;s a short list of the most notable ones:
A few quick words on my &quot;less than optimal&quot; hardware: I basically had to make do with a small laptop that has definitely seen better days (days that have long since passed, I should probably add) with a freshly installed Ubuntu 20. But I could, of course, connect to my PC at the office over company VPN, as I&#x27;m sure is the case for many of you as well.
I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Vim for several years now, so editing text from the terminal has always felt very natural for me. This has proven itself to be incredibly useful in working remot…</span>

It is common knowledge that NAS is a server-type storage system designed to store various information at the file level. In fact, this is a computer with an array of disks inside, which is connected to a network. Every authorized user can interact with any files stored in a NAS. Such storage systems are becoming more and more popular because most of them make use of the RAID technology: It provides a serious boost in fault tolerance and increases security of storing large amounts of data. However, there is no system to give you a 100% guarantee against data loss. Sometimes, users ha…</span>

Also, programs start stacking up. You would need so many different programs like PHP, Python, MySQL, maybe nodeJS, which get jumbled on your computer.
Vagrant provides a separate OS box, a Virtual Machine loaded with PHP, Python-related development environments. It helps keep your OS free and clean.
Vagrant gets rid of the many development and production environments. Usually, we develop on Mac and need to deploy on a Linux server. Vagrant helps keep the process quick and easy to deploy after coding.

As my time at Lambda School is coming to an end I wanted to talk about my incredible  experience from this past month.  It was the day after Memorial Day and a cohort of developers had to fill out a form to be placed in a Lambda School lab project. Forms were submitted and the wait came to be placed in teams. The notification came in and I was placed in HRF Asylum  where I’ll be working with two teams of developers and data scientists that consisted of over 15 other students. It was the beginning of a memorable experience that had transitioned everyone of us from removing aspiring developers from our vocabulary.
The project that we worked on is for a non for profit organization called HRF (Human Rights First) that has served over three decades in protecting human rights of…</span>

                    <span>When we&#x27;re trying to learn something new, it can oftentimes be tempting to dive headfirst into documentation, articles, and conceptual explanations. While all of that is certainly important, programmers have a great tool in their arsenal for understanding complex topics that they often take for granted.
Building models for different topics in code can help us understand how different pieces of an idea fit together and operate in practice.
In this tutorial, I&#x27;ll show you how to build a rudimentary blockchain with some relatively simple Javascript.
It can be helpful to think of blockchains as augmented linked lists, or arrays in which each element points to the preceding array.
Within each block (equivalent to an element in an array) of the blockchain, there contains at least the following:

                    <span>Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.
Dotenv Module will help us to populate runtime configuration during runtime, like populating mysql connection details while starting up mysql connection with nodejs, or providing mongodb connection url while starting application 
require(&#x27;dotenv&#x27;).config() it will populate all .env variables in process.env object
So all required configuration gets populated to process.env and application runs as expected.
Environment variables are supported out of the box with Node and are accessible via the env object (which is a property of the process global object.)

Open your terminal (linux hit: Ctrl + Alt + T) and run the following command. Running the command will create a new folder someproject in the current directory and change the current directory to someproject directory.
$ mkdir someproject &amp;&amp; cd someproject

To install the dependency of the project, we will use NPM (node package manager) so that the dependency can be installed easily.
Now, we need to run npm init. If you run this command, you will be asked some information. We can keep the default information. If you want, you can change it from the package.json.

It is the oldest trick in the book. The honeypot technique is easy to understand and implement. It works both for forms and comments. Here is a simple illustration that shows how honeypot spam filtering works.

A spam bot submits a form by making sure that every field or at least the ones that are required is filled so, no form validation prevents it from submitting. The honeypot technique relies on this assumption.

It is common knowledge that NAS is a server-type storage system designed to store various information at the file level. In fact, this is a computer with an array of disks inside, which is connected to a network. Every authorized user can interact with any files stored in a NAS. Such storage systems are becoming more and more popular because most of them make use of the RAID technology: It provides a serious boost in fault tolerance and increases security of storing large amounts of data. However, there is no system to give you a 100% guarantee against data loss. Sometimes, users ha…</span>

                    <span>Material UI


Material UI is a set of react components built based on the Material Design guidelines of Google.
Material UI consists of many accessible and configurable UI widgets.
The components are self-supporting and only inject the styles they need to display, which could lead to performance enhancements in your application.
Material UI has an active set of maintainers and a strong community behind it. It currently has over 69k stars on GitHub, making it one of the most popular component libraries out there.
If you’re looking to build a beautiful, consistent, and light interface quickly without sacrificing accessibility and performance, the material design will help you achieve that.

                    <span>A queue uses FIFO (first-in-first-out) ordering, that is, items are removed from the queue in the same order that they are added, like a line.

A queue can be implemented using an array or a linked list, can be either fixed or dynamic size.
Add - Add an item to the end of the queue, also called enqueue.
Remove - Remove the first item from the queue, also called dequeue.
Peek - Return the top of the queue, without removing it.
isEmpty - Return true if the queue is empty.
isFull - Return true if the stack is full, used when the queue is fixed size.
Here&#x27;s an implementation of a queue using an array, in TypeScript an array doesn&#x27;t have a fixed length, so the operation isFull is not required, however, you can implement a queue with a fixed length and use that operation.
class Queue {
  private array: T[] &#x3D; [];

  add(data: T): void {
    this.array.push(data);
  }

  remove(): T | undefined {
    if (this.isEmpty()) throw new EmptyQueueException();

    return this.array.shift();
  }

  peek(): T {
    if (this.isEmpty()) throw new EmptyQueueException();

    return this.array[0];
  }

  isEmpty(): boolean {
    return this.array.length &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 0;
  }

                    <span>When we’re building an application we often need to serialize objects to JSON for storing them in a key value store (e.g. Redis) or publishing them on a queue.
While there are libraries available like class-transformer or io-ts, there&#x27;s an easier way to serialize/unserialize objects to JSON.
class-transformer depends on the reflect-metadata package. Read this blogpost to know why you should be careful with depending on this package.
io-ts requires knowledge of some functional programming concepts. While I&#x27;m a big fan of functional programming, it&#x27;s not for everyone. (The library is very well designed though)
In both cases we also need to depend on an extra package.
We want to keep our dependencies as small as possible.

                    <span>Hi, everyone! 6 months ago, we released our first open source vue components library Qui. And we got a lot of feedback about it. The most popular question was &quot;Does it work with Vue 3?&quot;, and now, It does! We called it Qui-max! Yes, as iPhone Max :)
Vue 3 is getting popular. We like Composition API, it really helps you to keep your code clean and composable. The component&#x27;s api became more predictable. Making components, we also used new features as Teleports, plural v-model and others.

Types included, you can build your components with clear predictions. (p.s. I couldn&#x27;t imagine how useful Typescript can be, before I try.)

We build components with Vite (rollup.js inside), with treeshake and separate css files, so you can use a few components only and take care about your bundle size. (but no so fast).




Added simple animations for dropdowns 




The library is under development, so if you find a bug feel free to make an issue in our repo Qui-max</span>

So, what are template literal types?
In order to understand what template literal types are, we first need to have a brief look at literal types. Literal types allow us to define types that are more specific, instead of something that is generalized like string or number. 
Let&#x27;s say you have a switch; it can have the value of either on or off. One way of defining the types of this, is to use literal types, giving it the type of either On or Off:
type Switch &#x3D; &quot;On&quot; | &quot;Off&quot;

In the case above, the value of any variable of type Switch can only be On or Off:
const x: Switch &#x3D; &quot;On&quot;
const y: Switch &#x3D; &quot;Off&quot;

In this article i want to explain how to use angular forms directives in the right way, because i&#x27;ve observed that is not already clear how to use it correctly or what is the diferent about use template forms and built our owned form whith FormBuilder class. I am not going to enter in how to create a form in angular only i want to explain the interesting things.
I&#x27;m going to start with something very simple but could be doubs about this. 
The question is:  What happens when we use &lt;form #f&#x3D;&quot;ngForm&quot; ... ?
Someone could think that we&#x27;re referencing our form, this could be true, but in reality more things are happening behind the scenes.

                    <span>Hi all, in this article, we will discuss what canDeactivate means and how to have a custom confirmation modal implemented based on our app theme.
In Angular we get in build support for the routes we define to have implementation for canDeactivate guard which is how we can restrict the user from moving away from the view when some work is in progress on the current view. Example User is making an edit on his profile page and didn&#x27;t click on the save button so at that time if we have implemented the router guard for canDeactivate, the user will be asked for the confirmation.

While Angular is the most preferred frontend framework among the developers for developing single-page applications, there are still security threats that need due attention for protecting Angular apps. 
Keep these top 5 security best practices at hand when building Angular apps. 
To prevent the injection of scripts into DOM elements such as authentication details, social security numbers, web tokens, etc. 
To prevent these malfunctions, use the InnerHTML property to sanitizes all the data that shows in components.

                    <span>Custom validators in Angular’s reactive form library are one of the most powerful (and in my opinion overlooked) tools a developer has to create better form UI/UX. Custom validators aren’t just limited to a single control. It is easy to evaluate an entire group. This is great for comparing multiple controls. In this article I create a multi-control custom validator that validates two fields if their values match to show an example of what is possible.
As I mentioned in my previous article about custom validators, I like using them to both handle custom logic that the built-in validators don’t, and to be able to create the validation error messages in one spot. This makes custom validators powerful and very reusable.

# sudo apt install curl git
$ git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.8.1

Abra o arquivo ~/.bashrc e adicione as seguintes linhas:

                    <span>Introduction


Keymapping or Key binding is a process in which a user or a system can assign certain keys or commands to perform a particular task or commands. This can be quite useful in Vim as well as in other text editors to avoid some repetitive tasks and save time. In Vim this can be a great power to have for programmers as it can be really very flexible to set up for any programming language and it&#x27;s environment.
This is not a in-depth guide of Vim-keymappings, it is just a overview of how to make keymappings and make the workflow a bit easier, probably give some insights on the strength of Vim to easily integrate with terminal and perform tasks with shortcuts. 
In Vim, you can map a particular keystroke combination to trigger a command or any operation. You can also map a key in pla…</span>

                    <span>Some upcoming work is on the horizon which I need to work with something I&#x27;ve not had the pleasure before - Kafka.
I thought it best to try out Kafka on my own terms using technologies I&#x27;m comfortable with before going into the real world and breaking something in production. 
Two thoughts knocked around:
I wasn&#x27;t concerned with configuring Kafka itself
I wanted to use Node to communicate with Kafka
As I wasn&#x27;t too concerned with the configuration of Kafka itself I decided to use this handy blog post from baeldung.com where I was walked through the steps needed to get an instance of Kafka running locally via docker.

                    <span>Axios is our recommended JavaScript HTTP client. While we are opposed to unnecessary outside dependencies, Axios has several advantages over fetch():
Axios is isomorphic, fetch is not
Axios throws an error when a request fails
Automatic JSON and Form-Encoded Serialization and Parsing
Interceptors and instances
Another reason is that Axios has neat helper methods that allow you to set the request method, like GET or POST. For example, below is how you can send an HTTP GET request with Axios.
const axios &#x3D; require(&#x27;axios&#x27;);

const res &#x3D; await axios.get(&#x27;https://httpbin.org/get?answer&#x3D;42&#x27;);

res.data.args; // { answer: 42 }

Want to send a POST request? That&#x27;s easy, just change get() for post() and pass the request body as the 2nd parameter.
const res &#x3D; await axios.post(&#x27;https://httpbin.org/post&#x27;, { hello: &#x27;world&#x27; });

res.data.json; // { hello: &#x27;world&#x27; }

Axios as a Function


If you prefer the named parameters approach that fetch() uses, you can also set the request method by setting the method option as shown below.
let res &#x3D; await axios({
  method: &#x27;GET&#x27;,
  url: &#x27;https://httpbin.org/get?answer&#x3D;42&#x27;
});

res.data.args; // { answer: 42 }</span>

                    <span>What is Claudia.js?


Claudia.js is a tool designed to simplify deployment of Node.js projects to AWS Lambda and API Gateway. It automates deployment tasks so you don’t need to worry about introducing errors and configures everything the way you would expect it to be set up out of the box.
According to the official website, Claudia’s primary objective is to help JavaScript developers get started using Lambda microservices easily so they can “focus on solving important business problems instead of dealing with AWS deployment workflows.”
In this section, we’ll walk you through setting up an example Node.js and Express.js app to show Claudia.js in action.
Claudia.js is available on npm. The simplest way to use Claudia.js is to install it as a global utility:

npm install -g claudia


Install the Express.js app generator using npm:

npm install express-generator -g

express claudia-demo

cd claudia-demo

npm i


The Express.js app will be hosted by a Lambda function, so it needs a handler to send data between the app and the API Gateway. This is where Claudia.js comes in. Claudia uses aws-serverless-express to generate a helper function to interface between API Gateway requests and Express.js requests and responses.
Execute the command below in your project directory. If you have renamed your Express.js application module, replace app with the name of the main Express.js application module:
$ claudia generate-serverless-express-proxy --express-module
app

Your app is now ready to go live:

claudia create --handler lambda.handler \ 
   --deploy-proxy-api \ 
   --region us-east-1

Fiber is a web framework for Go similar to Mux. But it&#x27;s heavily inspired by Express and that makes it perfect to work with for node developers.
It is built on top of Fasthttp engine, here are some benchmarks. It also has quite a low memory allocation overhead. For example while writing this article it only took around only ~16mb of memory, which was amazing!
In this article let&#x27;s implement very simple mock api routes to get a feel of the Fiber framework
The code from the article is available in this repository
You can install go directly on your system by installing the binary from go docs https://golang.org/doc/install

(optional)
Personally, I like to use docker so I don&#x27;t have to install anything on my system

                    <span>I recently wrote about extending the functionality of Octopus to integrate with HashiCorp Vault using step templates. Afterwards, several people asked if I plan to create step templates to integrate with other secret managers.
In this post, I walk through a new step template, Azure Key Vault - Retrieve Secrets, which is designed to retrieve secrets from an Azure Key Vault for use in your deployments or runbooks.



This post assumes some familiarity with custom step templates and the Octopus Community Library. 
In addition, this post doesn&#x27;t go into great detail about Azure Key Vault concepts or how to set it up. You can learn more by reading the Azure Key Vault basic concepts guide from Microsoft.

                    <span>Usually in these when I write about some library or app I try to highlight its strengths. Well this time I’m going to do the complete opposite and talk about weaknesses. Rest assured it won&#x27;t be some scorching review, because we’re looking at Damn Vulnerable GraphQL Application where weaknesses are completely intentional and exploiting them is the whole point.
As for why it&#x27;s fairly obvious, as GraphQL continues to grow and become more popular so too do the concerns about its vulnerabilities. After all, if you want to use it for your app you probably want it to be secure. So yes Damn Vulnerable GraphQL Application is full of weaknesses by design, it&#x27;s meant to test GraphQL’s safety against various attacks. Let’s look at these types of attacks (or scenarios) you can try out:

                    <span>It&#x27;s common to be concerned about security vulnerabilities in frontend frameworks. While Angular is the most preferred frontend framework among the developers for developing single-page applications, there are still security threats that need due attention for protecting Angular apps. 
Keep these top 5 security best practices at hand when building Angular apps. 
To prevent the injection of scripts into DOM elements such as authentication details, social security numbers, web tokens, etc. 
To prevent these malfunctions, use the InnerHTML property to sanitizes all the data that shows in components.

                    <span>I began building a blog application for a site that I may or may not finish. The bulk of the project is based on the blog-starter-typescript example in the NextJs GitHub repo. Their example loads markdown files from a folder in the root directory and uses remark and gray-matter to convert the markdown into html and to get file metadata. The example code for these function is located in their lib folder as api.ts and markdownToHtml.ts. 
The system they used works very well, however, if you plan on creating many posts and incorporating many images then that is when the system begins to breakdown. Since you store all of the markdown files and images in your root directory then it will perpetually grow and hosting costs for packages that large are affected.

                    <span>Webpack is a build tool to make code, which was not primarily written for execution in browsers, executable in web browsers. With special plugins, webpack can manage many types of code, for example JavaScript, TypeScript, and Rust-generated WebAssembly.
There are webpack plugins to also compile, minify, shim, chunk, and bundle code. However, webpack was not designed to execute tasks such as linting, building, or testing your app. For this purpose, there are task runners such as Grunt, Gulp or npx.
In order to manage the functionality of webpack, it must be configured. Here are six different ways, in which webpack&#x27;s configuration can be written.
As of webpack version 4, you are not required to specify a configuration. By default, webpack assumes that your code starts at src/index.js and wil…</span>

UI blocking is a thing of the past!


https://angularprojects.com


If you are building an application where you do a lot of calculations on UI, such as creating CAD documents, doing heavy geometrical calculations, or heavy data table manipulations, then you might have observed that the UI sometimes becomes laggy or janky.
This happens because JavaScript is not the only thing that runs on the main thread, but other things like the painting of pixels, style calculations, and many others also run on it. When we run heavy long-running JavaScript on the browser, occasionally we see that frames are missed, which does not provide a great User Experience.

                    <span>Hello Developers! All we are using either Axios OR fetch to communicate/exchange data with server. Both works perfect as per your requirement. Today we will go in detail and see how they are differ in terms of features they provide.
Axios — has url in request object
axios
  .get(url, {
    headers: {
      &#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;application/json&#x27;,
    },
    timeout: 1000 * 60,
  })
  .then(res &#x3D;&gt; {

  })
  .catch(err &#x3D;&gt; {

  })

Fetch — has no url in request object.
 fetch(url)
  .then((response) &#x3D;&gt; response.json())
  .then((json) &#x3D;&gt; {  

  })
  .catch(() &#x3D;&gt; {

  })

Axios — third-party package that you need to install manually. 85.3k Star in Github — Well managed &amp; rich features library.
npm i axios
Fetch — is in-build into most of the browser, no more need of installation.

You can use cloud storage for on-premises data backups to reduce infrastructure and administration costs. There is several ways to backup your on-premise infrastructure to cloud, here I’ll use hybrid cloud (part of your infrastructure is on the cloud and part of your infrastructure is on the on-premise) to accomplish it. In this post I’ll show AWS Storage Gateway solutions to bridge between on-premise data to cloud. The common use case is disaster recovery, backup &amp; restore and tiered storage.
There is 3 types of Storage Gateway:

Before show how I implemented it, I’ll show a brief overview about each one.
Databases and applications are often backed up directly to a file server on-premises. You can now simply point these backups to the File Gateway, which copies the data to …</span>

                    <span>SCP comes in handy to copy files to a remote server from a computer or vice versa. You can also copy server files to another server.
All you need is your server’s IP address and user credentials to start copying. Here are some common SCP commands use cases.
scp file.zip user@hostip:/home/directory

This command will copy file.zip in your terminals present working directory to the home directory of the server.
scp user@hostip:/home/directory/file.zip ~/Downloads

You are copying file.zip from the server’s home directory to your local downloads folder.
Another use case of the SCP command is during site migration to a new server. Zip your site’s root directory and copy it to the new server.
Provide login credentials and file paths of both servers to SCP in your computer’s terminal.
scp user@remotehost1:/home/file.zip user@remotehost2:/home

Add -p flag to add port of remote host
scp -p 1122 file.zip user@hostip:/home/directory

Add a -C flag to enable the gzip compression in SSH transfer
scp -C localfile.zip user@hostip:/home/directory

-v Verbose SCP operation
-p 
 Mention remote host port
-P Save the file’s modification and access times
-r Copy recursively
-c  Specify the cipher for data encryption
So if you are still using an FTP client, use the SCP command in the terminal for a secure transfer.</span>

                    <span>Developers are always looking for simpler ways to do more advanced things in less time, and one of the many ways that they can achieve this is by using a selection of tools to supplement their workflow. The aim of this article is to cover some of the major tools that people use, and to give you an insight into what they can do to make your life easier.
And to seal the deal, all the tools I’ll be mentioning are completely free to use, which is an incredible price for what you’re getting from them.
Git / Version Control
Git is the most well-known version control tool out there. It allows you to store your code on a server (thereby reducing data-loss risks), collaborate with other developers and share your code online. Another huge plus to Git is that it allows you to go and look at other people’s public repositories, and see how they solved certain problems. This can then help you solve the problem in your application, and it can save you lots of time and effort.
Git is open-source itself and it comes with a huge selection of extensions that allow you to modify the functionality of the system in a huge range of different ways.
The fact that Git allows you to go back and review previous versions of your code, see how it’s changed and keep track of issues as well as provide you with lots of automation tools makes it quite clear that Git, or a Git alternative is a must-have for nearly every project.
Whilst you could install a system like Gitea on a VPS and then run your own Git server, there is a selection of different services out there that provide Git repository hosting as a service. These services often come with lots of extras too, and usually a very generous free tier. The most notable Git host out there is definitely GitHub, but it is closely rivalled by GitLab among other solutions.
