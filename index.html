                    <span>Node.js v14.17 release added crypto.randomUUID(). This method allows to generate random RFC 4122 Version 4 UUID strings. Example:
const { randomUUID } &#x3D; require(&#x27;crypto&#x27;);

console.log(randomUUID());
// &#x27;43c98ac2-8493-49b0-95d8-de843d90e6ca&#x27;

I wondered how big the difference between uuid generation by Node.js API and uuid package.
For benchmarking I prefer to use hyperfine. It is like apache benchmark, but for CLI commands. There are have two cases:
require(&#x27;crypto&#x27;).randomUUID()
require(&#x27;uuid&#x27;).v4()

                    <span>The useReducer hook is an alternative to the useState hook and is preferable when you have complex state logic or when your next state depends on your previous state.
The useReducer hook accepts a reducer type (state, action) &#x3D;&gt; newState and returns a state object paired with a dispatch method much like Redux.
Now the official useReducer documentation will show you how to define a reducer that accepts actions you will call with a dispatch method.

With such an approach, you can take advantage of both worlds and decide whether you want to use features from Rails or Angular to format stuff, for example.

YAML Aliases allow you to assign a name to a value or block of data and recall the assigned data by its name in the YAML file. Aliases should work for any file written in YAML.

We would be using xmrig to mine XMR, it is a great miner, it also doesn&#x27;t charge a huge fee, you set the percentage of the fees yourself too
Since xmrig doesn&#x27;t give us the binary themselves so we have to build them ourselves, this doesn&#x27;t take much bandwidth not much processing power, and time though

                    <span>Curious to try the streams but you don&#x27;t know if they can serve you? Let&#x27;s see its uses together!
In an event-based platform such as Node.js, the most efficient way to handle I/O is in real-time, consuming the input as soon as it is available and sending the output as soon as the application produces it.
Streams allow us to process the data as soon as it arrives from the resource. This is different from buffering, where all the data that comes from a resource needs to be collected into a buffer until the op‚Ä¶</span>

When we are developing a website we normally talk about code inside the frontend (browser) or the backend (server). In the past, Javascript was confined to work only in the browser (frontend) which was used to add interactivity to the website. We never used to run Javascript directly on the computer or server but in recent times Node.js has made that possible. Node.js allows us to run javascript on the server side (backend) or directly on computers.

Note that, in this app, I have used INR as the currency for displaying the prices but you can easily change it to USD or AUD or any other currency with a single configuration change in the app.

                    <span>DevOps has changed the way developers and operating engineers think. The DevOps paradigm has transformed the software and technology development process. As a result, improving performance and delivering faster outcomes have become the standard of meeting the market&#x27;s demands.
However, as the infrastructure evolves, security has become a new concern. Developers are now working to address it on a regular basis. Security professionals have had to look at options that can implement security mechanisms through ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Ensuring application security is extremely important. But usually it&#x27;s also pretty tedious and definitely not fun.
The tools we use are usually slow and not very accurate, and this leads to not using them properly.
Notice that I&#x27;ve said &quot;usually&quot;, because I think I&#x27;ve found the solution for it. Or, better, Snyk has found it.

                    <span>A seemingly common complaint regarding NestJS and TypeScript is the absence of interfaces in runtime code (since interfaces are removed during transpilation).  This limitation prevents the use of constructor-based dependency injection and instead necessitates use of the @Inject decorator.  That decorator requires us to associate some &quot;real&quot; JavaScript token with the interface to resolve the dependency - often just a string of the interface name:

We used tsc command to compile our app with specific rules and in watch mode. It works but we can use much more options of TypeScript compiler.

                    <span>So you&#x27;ve got an enum type in your database table. The user needs to be able to set that property via a dropdown in your web application. But it&#x27;s possible the table will require more enum types in the future. How do we write a dropdown that remains as flexible as the enum type itself? 
For this example we&#x27;ll use a Post as our database table.
CREATE TYPE post_status AS ENUM (&#x27;published&#x27;, &#x27;draft&#x27;, &#x27;review&#x27;);

                    <span>You may have noticed that the typing provided by 3rd party libraries often feels very loose. This should not come as a surprise as to maintain flexibility for all users it is not always possible to provide stricter typings.
However, there is nothing to stop us, within our own applications, adding a layer of more explicit typing on top of the library interface. In doing so we can leverage Typescript to greatly improve the developer experience, as well as encouraging consistently in how the library is used.

If you are like me, a VIM user, but have never used windows, now is a great time to do it!
The main reason I didn&#x27;t use windows in VIM is because I use Tmux. But this is a bad reason, and not everybody is used to use Tmux, even though you should because this is a fantastic tool.
The second bad reason why I don&#x27;t use windows is because I don&#x27;t really like the key combination. Since most of the keys are used for something very logical, there is no more space for using window efficiently, meaning we ‚Ä¶</span>

Oftentimes simple kubectl logs or kubectl describe pod is enough to find the culprit of some problem, but some issues are harder to hunt down. In those cases you might try to use kubectl exec but even that might not be enough as some containers such as Distroless don&#x27;t even contain shell that you could SSH into.
