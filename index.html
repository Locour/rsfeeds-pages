                    <span>I only found lists polluted with dead/toy/component-library OSS projects. (or even containing AngularJS projects)
I want to find some real and alive open source projects which are using Angular. I&#x27;m sure some of us want to dive deeper and read some Angular code used in real life.
Feel free to mention projects in the comments and I will try to keep the list up to date.

                    <span>Do it
But how does Angular know how to deal with this (click) thing? 
It works because of the so called Event Biding. Basically it binds the target event name (click) to a method from the component (doSomething).
As explained in this nice article , Angular doesn&#x27;t have a list of it&#x27;s own event names, but it actually uses the names of the underlying DOM events.
So the event binding part of the Do it snippet is the equivalent of this vanilla snippet:
element.addEventListener(&#x27;click&#x27;, () &#x3D;&gt; { doSomething() });


This means the if I want to know which events I can bind to in Angular I can search them here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
What about the $event?
If the event is a DOM event, like click, mouseenter, keyup etc then the $event is the event itself. For example in the case of click, the $event is a MouseEvent.
EventEmitter) the $event is actually the emitted data.</span>

                    <span>How to deploy and angular app to GitHub pages and get it running under your own domain: username.github.io. Also you can use the GitHub API to get access to your repositories data as I did on my personal portfolio:
Live demo
Source code
Git
GitHub account
Angular CLI
Create a new public repository using your GitHub username and this form:
username.github.io

First, clone the newly created repository to a local folder:
$ git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
Navigate to the repository root folder:
$ cd username.github.io
Create a new angular project in the root directory of the repo:
$ ng new myApp --directory ./
Open angular.json file and change the buildOutput path to “docs”:
angular.json
…
&quot;architect&quot;: {
        &quot;build&quot;: {
          &quot;builder&quot;: &quot;@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser&quot;,
          &quot;options&quot;: {
            &quot;outputPath&quot;: &quot;docs&quot;,
…

Build the angular application in production mode:
$ ng build --prod
You can push the /docs folder only, or you can push the whole application /myApp (recommended):
$ git add .
$ git commit -m &quot;Init app&quot;
$ git push
Now navigate to your repository settings https://github.com/username/username.github.io/settings

scroll down to the GitHub pages section to change the build source to /docs. Few seconds later your site will be built and published and you should see the message “Your site is published at…”. If don’t, try refreshing the site.

Then you can view the deployments at the right side of the repository, under environments, pressing github-pages or at https://github.com/username/username.github.io/deployments

You can make changes locally, test them using $ ng serve and then build for production using $ ng build --prod and push your updated code to GitHub. The page will automatically re-build.</span>

Time passed, I finally learned what unit tests are, what this cheap rabbit represents and I would like to help you understand too.
But what are unit tests?
A unit test is basically testing the smallest testable part of a program.
Okay, but what does that mean?
If you pr the grass in a language that supports functional paradigm for example, the smallest testable part of your code should be a function. So a unit test would be the test of any function. In the case of object orientation it would be the testing of a method of your object.
Well… as everything is easier to understand in practice, let&#x27;s go to the code!
In the example below, we have a function that adds two numbers and returns the sum val…</span>

The idea of leveraging tools and frameworks to create better software is not new. For example, in traditional product-centric approaches, vendors pushed developers to build services that orbited around a smart integration bus with the vain hope of making the software more robust (Oracle SOA Suite anyone?). Constrained by lots of proprietary technologies, this approach was far from ideal for developers to design and build their applications. Nowadays, with the emergence of standards-based computing utilities (Serverless) and the novel software engineering practices that evolved with them (NoOps), we can look at these internal tools from a more developer-centric point of view.
Nowadays, you no longer need to buy a product to cover …</span>

                    <span>Modern days having that cookies auth etc depends on https we need to have https local web environment.
Before to generate local certificates I used minica. 
The main issue that you need a big readme for osx, linux and windows users, how to regenerate keys, 
Having that we use vscode remote for development it was 2x more work to register all that keys on local and remote machines.
The solution below doesnt need any setup from developers. 
Register on DNS provider A records for development like:
A blabla.devdomain.com 127.0.0.1
Then using letsencrypt certbot for your provider just generate needed certificates.
They are already trusted and the only issue is 3 month expiration period, what can be easily fixed with cron.
In our case we use cloudflare as DNS.

                    <span>Understanding Docker can be difficult or time-consuming. In order to spread knowledges about Cloud technologies I started to create sketchnotes about Docker, then I&#x27;ve auto-published a book and since now I&#x27;ve started a new serie of video! :-)
I imagined a serie of short videos with a mix of sketchnotes and speech.
I think it could be a good way, more visual, with audio &amp; video to explain Docker (and others technologies).
The first episode is focused on a very important Docker object: Images.




The video is in French BUT I done the subtitles in english (and french too).
If you liked the video and are interested to watch another ones, please give me some feedbacks (and you can also subscribe to my Youtube channel, if you want to ❤️).
I can also give you, in an article, the full english transcript and sketchnotes in high quality, about this video, if you are interested.
If you are interested, I published all the sketchnotes on Docker (and new ones!) to make a &quot;book&quot; of 120 pages: &quot;Understanding Docker in a visual way&quot;.
If you like theses sketchnotes, you can follow me, I will publish others sketchs shortly :-).</span>

                    <span>Security is a broad topic, and one I am certainly no expert at. However, there are some really simply things you can do to increase the security of your web application.
For starters, there are some HTTP Response Headers you can include in your web responses, that can prevent easily preventable vulnerabilities.
This will aim to outline all of the headers recommended by the OWASP Secure Headers Project, as part of a series. Let&#x27;s begin with a couple.

As a caveat, these are by no means foolproof. However, they do provide a first layer of defense in depth for attackers.
The recommended mechanism for configuring your web application to return these headers in every response, is by configuring your web server. Since nginx is a widely used option, I will provide examples that demonstrate how to…</span>

It has its own UI, CLI, formats etc. I feel this may have endless possibilities for its usage, also may come up with something creative. I would also like if any one can collaborate for the same. Currently it has all the data static, but arrangements have been made to make it dynamic using a backend. So, lets get in touch...

GraphQL has become quite popular due to its various features fixing under/over fetching issues. It also allows for easy caching, federation, non-versioning APIs, subscriptions etc,.
For the modern Internet where data needs to be accessible on various types of applications running on various types of devices, GraphQL seems like a great way forward and also a good concept to put into your knowledge bag.
GraphQL request and responses are typically in JSON format even though the GraphQL Spec doesn&#x27;t mandate any format…</span>

                    <span>In part 1, we set up the nestjs framework and configured and tested microservices architecture application using nest.js. In part 2, we used Sequelize and mongoose to access the database and tested for both MySQL database and MongoDB.
In this part; we will see how to let the application connect to multiple databases depending on the request. Since it is a multi-tenancy application, each tenant has their own database containing their data accessing the same application, thus the application needs to connect to different databases.
forRootAsync() instead of forRoot(), we need to use a custom class for configuration.
For both sequelize and mongoose, add this:

                    <span>Several months ago I was new to React.  As an experienced developer of classic javascript, one of the most objectionable things about the newer thick client frameworks such as React and Angular is the need to build the client side application to see changes. Let&#x27;s face it, we are used to only having to refresh the browser page.  Fortunately for us the community has has helped us out with this issue, specifically the Create React App community.
1) Node.js, React, and Webpack are watching your code and transpiling it - It&#x27;s no secret that React delivered to the browser is quite different than what you wrote. Your tsx code has to be changed to jsx and your jsx code has to be changed to javascript, and this javascript has to be packed up for delivery to the browser.  Since you don&#x27;t feel like doing this on your own some automation is in order, fortunately you will not have to think about this, just know that it is happening.
2) A socket has been created on the browser back to the server - This is where the real magic is because by creating a socket with the server, communication can be pushed to the browser instead of having the browser poll the server, which would be far more messy.  So everytime you change your code, the chain reaction described in step one happens and then a message is sent up the socket to tell the browser to refresh the page.
There is a really interesting wrinkle to step 2.  If you load your page and then fire up your DOM inspector you will not see this socket, which is super confusing.  However, if you force a refresh of your browser page with the inspector open you will then see the socket.  A bug perhaps in Chrome?
So there it is, a peak behind the curtain.  Happy coding.

                    <span>You are logged into your system. In this case, it&#x27;s macOS. You are facing just a simple question. Are you the only one who is logged in? I would like to give you an answer to this simple question with a bit of explanation. Here in upcoming lines, there will be a bit of theory background behind it.
In case your system is healthy (understand as an official system with applied updates), you are the only physical user logged in. You can check this logged in information with a simple command you will enter into the terminal. But there is a trick in that, will explain in next lines hereunder. Open your Terminal.app you&#x27;ll find out in Finder in the section Applications and Utilities. For more informations check official Terminal User Guide.
By entering uptime command you&#x27;ll be informed in one line output about the current time, number of days your system is up, number of logged-in users etc.
uptime

If you&#x27;ll enter this very same command into the terminal in capital form as UPTIME, you&#x27;ll receive a more readable summary of the logged-in sessions by the user.
UPTIME

The same output can be given by entering w command into the terminal.
w

Do remember you will always have a minimum of 2 logged-in users. By default when you open another terminal session it will be counted as another active user logged in. In other words, if you open four-terminal sessions, you will see 4 users logged in +1 as the default logged-in user I have written about.</span>

One month ago, We started working on a lossless compression algorithm. We took a message from an alphabets of $n$ symbols and tried to find a way to reduce the amount of bits used tohold the message. Normally each symbol in the alphabet hold 


After seraveral tries, We found an algorithm which compress the source data with a constant ratio. 
This is how the algorithm works.
The algorithm don&#x27;t work on symbol directly but use them to construct the treatement block. And it takes as input the binary form of the message regardless of the message type, pass the binary data to the treatlent block and at output we get a new binary data which size is…</span>

In this article, we will briefly learn about some of the most common types of cyber attacks  and how to protect yourself from them.
Phishing involves sending emails that appear to be from trusted sources. The goal is to make the victim click on the link and trick them into giving their login credentials or spreading malware.
Spear phishing is carried out in the same way, except it is more focused on particular people. The attacker has to do some research on the victim before sending them the malicious link. For example, with a little research an attacker can find your …</span>

                    <span>Security is a broad topic, and one I am certainly no expert at. However, there are some really simply things you can do to increase the security of your web application.
For starters, there are some HTTP Response Headers you can include in your web responses, that can prevent easily preventable vulnerabilities.
This will aim to outline all of the headers recommended by the OWASP Secure Headers Project, as part of a series. Let&#x27;s begin with a couple.

As a caveat, these are by no means foolproof. However, they do provide a first layer of defense in depth for attackers.
The recommended mechanism for configuring your web application to return these headers in every response, is by configuring your web server. Since nginx is a widely used option, I will provide examples that demonstrate how to…</span>

                    <span>On bergqvist.it I used styled jsx for styling my components. I preferred that to other css-in-js frameworks (like JSS) because of it actually using CSS syntax instead of JavaScript objects.
    // styled jsx example with good old CSS
    {&#x60;
      .label { color: red; font-style: italic; }
      .article { padding: 0; }
    &#x60;}
    

    //JSS example with CSS as a JS object
    const useStyles &#x3D; createUseStyles({
      label: {
        color: &#x27;red&#x27;
        fontStyle: &#x27;italic&#x27;
      },
      article: {
        padding: 0
      }
    })

I like Styled jsx but it has had an issue with FOUC in the last few versions of Next.js though, and with Next 12 I decided to try something new and migrate to CSS Modules instead.

In this part; we will see how to let the application connect to multiple databases depending on the request. Since it is a multi-tenancy application, each tenant has their own database containing their data accessing the same application, thus the application needs to connect to different databases.
forRootAsync() instead of forRoot(), we need to use a custom class for configuration.

จริงๆแล้วผมเคยได้ยินyarn (berry) มานานมาแล้วแต่ไม่เคยลองเพราะว่าช่วงนั้นผมเคยเห็น issue ที่ใช้แล้ว project ไม่สามารถรันได้เลยก็เลยคิดว่ารอสักพักค่อยมาลองสุดท้ายก็ลืม -.- 
ตั้งแต่เข้าสู่วงการ dev ผมก็เริ่มที่ npm -&gt; yarn(classic) -&gt; pnpm(ปัจจุบัน)
ขอย้อนไปตอนที่ใช้ yarn classic (หลังจากนี้จะขอย่อว่า classic) ผมใช้ feature นึงคือตัว worksapcesใช้มาประมาณ 3 ปีได้แล้วถ้านับไม่ผิด และก็เมื่อไม่นานมานี้ผมได้เห็นตัว pnpm เป็นที่พูดถึงกันก็เลยลองไปดูว่ามันเป็นยังไงมี feature ไหนบ้าง
หลังจากที่ไปดูว่าโดยรวมถือว่าโอเคเลยมีทุก feature ที่ผมใช้หลังจากนั้นโปรเจคช่วงๆหลังผมจะเป็น pnpm ทั้งหมด

                    <span>Let&#x27;s build this counter application using react-typescript.We are going to use useReducer hook for this application.

Let&#x27;s set up our application
$ cd Desktop
$ mkdir react-counter
$ cd react-counter

Now create a react app
$ npx create-react-app ./ --template typescript

You should see a brand new react application.Clean up all unnecessary files.You can use a different component but in my case i am going to use App.tsx component.
At first create a component App and export it defaultly
const App:React.FunctionComponent&#x3D;()&#x3D;&gt;{
  return 

}

Now we are going to setup our useReducer hooks.Add this statement to your code
const [state, dispatch] &#x3D; React.useReducer(counterReducer, initialState);

Best Frameworks for Developing Progressive Web Applications
1. AngularJS
It is a framework built in 2010 and largely used for creating dependable and stable PWAs using the ecosystem of JavaScript. The system helps make an amazing PWA through JSON set up so that there is no need to begin from scratch. Angular’s web app development services are so much easier as it saves the hassle of handling repetitive tasks.
PWAs created using this framework also leverage the distinctive compilation method and ahead-of-time or AOT. It has a large developers community, a huge third-party extensions archive, and modular elements. The security and speed are increased with the amazing concept of the AOT compiler.

Some applications need multiple languages, but others need one language but have loads of content to re-use. In this article, I want to show you the fastest way to create a content (some call it a dictionary) Service for your Angular application.
If you need a content service with multiple languages, I highly recommend NGX-Translate. This package offers a simple API and Pipe mechanism to re-use pieces of content but also supports multiple languages.

                    <span>Introduction


In this tutorial, I will show you how Materialize works by using it to run SQL queries on continuously produced nginx logs. By the end of the tutorial, you will have a better idea of what Materialize is, how it&#x27;s different than other SQL engines, and how to use it.
For the sake of simplicity, I will use a brand new Ubuntu 21.04 server where I will install nginx, Materialize and mzcli, a CLI tool similar to psql used to connect to Materialize and execute SQL on it.
If you want to follow along you could spin up a new Ubuntu 21.04 server on your favorite could provider. 
If you prefer running Materialize on a different operating system, you can follow the steps on how to install Materialize here:

                    <span>TL;DR: Open a terminal with admin rights and execute the following command: wsl --install. If you want to choose a distro, continue reading!
Until very recently, you had to go through multiple steps to enable WSL in your system. The worst part was that some of them were in the control panel, others in a terminal, and you also had to use the Microsoft Store to choose the Linux distribution you wanted.
With the recent changes they&#x27;ve made for the release of both Windows 11 and the latest Windows 10 update, installing WSL has become a straightforward task.
You only need to run one command if you&#x27;re happy with using Ubuntu as your Linux distribution:
wsl --install

If you prefer another distribution, with this other command, you can list all the available distros:
wsl --list --online

And then, run the installation command:
wsl --install -d 

That&#x27;s it! You&#x27;ll have to restart your computer, and then it will ask you for a username and password. Once you create your user, the process will be completed.</span>

 What is Ansible? 
Ansible is an open source tool that is most used by a SysAdmin in the process of automating.
 Why you should use Ansible? 
Ansible is a powerful tool that you can use in the process of server management, configuration task, and other tasks. So when you use Ansible, many process such as configuration or deployment an application in server will be simple and quickly.

Hoy es un nuevo día y con ello comienzan nuevos retos, esta vez realizare esto rápido ya que a pesar de que avance bastante en mis proyectos no me di cuenta del tiempo que paso. 
Avance un poco en la guia The odin Project

Instale linux Ubuntu y configure varias particiones necesarias para el curso mencionado arriba.
Aprendí sobre la diferencia de particiones GPT y MBR asi como que son Bios y UEFI.
Domine la herramienta rufus (algo mas para añadir al curriculum).
Avance hasta la sección de Fundamentos de HTML en The odin Project

Aprendí a agregar una clave ssh a mi cuenta de github.
Realice una instalación y configuracion de git en linux.
Cree un proyecto de ejemplo en github y realice cambios.
Aprendí que la mejor forma de hacer una explicación de los cambios en una confirmación (commit) es escribirlo de forma imperativa.
Volví a aprender los comandos basicos de linux como pwd, touch, cat, ls, cd entre otros.
Y eso es todo por hoy.
Espero que les vaya super bien y que tengan éxito con sus proyectos.

NodeJS nacio en el año 2009 bajo del nombre de Nodo por Ryan Dahl, quien para ese año formaba parte de Joyent, la empresa que sería la propietaria de NodeJS.
A pesar que en sus inicios NodeJS tuvo un desarrollo lento, llego a ser la potente plataforma que es hoy, consagrandose como una de las más amadas de los últimos años.
Es un entorno de ejecucion de un solo hilo de código abierto y multiplataforma, de ahí que tenga tan buena comunidad de soporte, se ejecuta bajo el motor JS V8 usado por Google.
En cuanto al lenguaje implementado, el elegido fue JS, mismo que se uso en Scripts del lado de cliente durante sus primeros años (20 aproximadamente), y solo podia usarse con la implementación de  en el que un desarrollador necesitaba trabajar con multiples lenguajes para moverse entre el Backend y Frontend.
NodeJS está escrito en los inmortales C y C++, y no dejando por fuera JS.
Aplicaciones de chat en tiempo real.
Aplicaciones web.
Servicios de API Rest.
IoT.
Streaming de datos.
Aplicaciones complejas de una sola Página.
Sobre el futuro de NodeJS es dificil de decirlo a ciencia cierta, dado que es una tecnología joven y que continua expandiendose, cuenta con un gran futuro por delante, pero tambien dependera del apoyo que la comunidad siga brindandole.

So I made this cheatsheet for myself so I had something to refer to.

In this cheatsheet show the pipeline of Middleware -&gt; Guards -&gt; Before Interceptors -&gt; Pipes -&gt; Controllers -&gt; Services -&gt; After Interceptors -&gt; Exception Filters that you would typically use in a NestJS rest application.
It&#x27;s important to note that some of these are just highly focused instances of middleware or interceptors. The middleware is the most generic pipeline context and the others are just NestJS constructs to encourage convention.

                    <span>I’m absolutely thrilled about Lacework’s newest announcement—we just acquired Soluble, a startup whose mission is to help security and operations teams leverage IaC to scale cloud operations and security for businesses of all sizes. I’m especially excited about what Lacework’s incorporation of the Soluble technology means for devs like yourselves. There are countless benefits, but these are the three that I’m looking forward to the most.  
IaC is quickly becoming the primary mechanism to manage cloud infrastructure at scale. This shift increases both velocity and risk—to keep up, security and development teams need to quickly address the resulting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Integrating the Soluble technology into Lacework’s platform and teaming with Soluble’s experts prepares us to shift further left into developer workflows. 
Lacework can directly and quickly reach developer audiences. Soluble helps Lacework make security issues easier to solve by correlating cloud misconfigurations to IaC and enabling remediation at the source via pull requests. This expands Lacework’s platform to the places where developers are writing their code: directly in the UX/CLI/GitHub and GitLab. For developers to integrate with Lacework, they simply need to connect through Git. 
Soluble shares Lacework’s vision to build a modern, data-driven approach to cloud security. Implementing Soluble’s capabilities to the Lacework platform helps security and operations teams shift further left and partner with developers so they can manage applications and infrastructure efficiently, securely, and reliably.
I’d love to hear your thoughts on this acquisition in the comments below👇.</span>

                    <span>That&#x27;s it! We are going to migrate our on-premise applications to Scaleway Elements! 
We start by deploying a first Web application to please the business team, we set up auto scaling and backups to satisfy the ops team, we encrypt the storage and the database with a key and a firewall to reassure the security team, all at a lower price. 
Everything has been thought of and the migration of the first application is a real success and the business accepts to migrate other applications ... But wait ... no long-term strategy has been established to facilitate the migration of new applications 😱
Moving to the Public Cloud represents a major change within a company. A phase of adoption and acculturation is necessary for a successful transition.

                    <span>Written by Faith Ng&#x27;etich ✏️
In this article, we’ll learn about how systems communicate seamlessly with each other through a process called serialization and deserialization and how we can apply that in TypeScript. The process is seamless because of how the transferable data is handled.
As a user, when you access any application, you do so to retrieve information. This information is made up of data that must be stored somewhere; this is where serialization comes in.
By the end of this article, you should be able to understand how data transfers from one location to another, what format it transfers in, and the possible options for storing data streams. We’ll also cover technical issues that can arise when working with serialization in TypeScript.
So what is serialization and deserializati…</span>

                    <span>Ughh… why does form code in React always get so messy?
It starts out simple: a  component, a couple input fields, and a submit button. But soon things get a little more complicated.
You think, &quot;hmmm.. I want some more validation for this zip code field&quot;. So you add a custom workaround that validates the data in the input field.
Then, you think &quot;I want to disable the submit button when the form is submitting&quot;. So you create another custom workaround that keeps track of what&#x27;s submitting, and when things are complete, etc.
Then, you think &quot;I want better error handling&quot;. So you add yet another workaround.
And over time that simple form balloons into a 400-line long super-component with multiple useEffects, useStates, and custom logic to handle all the edge cases.
Sound familiar?

                    <span>For someone who has worked with Typescript for the past 5+ years, I really miss it when it&#x27;s not there. I find adding types to my javascript code a nice comfort. Writing automated tests with Cypress is no exception. With that being said, adding Typescript support to your Cypress applications is easy peasy!
Cypress ships with official type declarations for TypeScript. This allows you to write your tests in TypeScript. The first thing we need to do is install the typescript dependency.
yarn add --dev typescript

Next we need to update our tsconfig.json file with the following configuration:
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    &quot;target&quot;: &quot;es5&quot;,
    &quot;lib&quot;: [&quot;es5&quot;, &quot;dom&quot;],
    &quot;types&quot;: [&quot;cypress&quot;]
  },
  &quot;include&quot;: [&quot;**/*.ts&quot;]
}

Finally we need to rename all of our .spec.js integration files to .spec.ts. 
If you are like me you&#x27;ve found the path to this point super simple! However, if your application is using Cypress&#x27;s Custom Commands API your Cypress application is now angry.

Don&#x27;t worry this is easy to fix! Let&#x27;s open the file that contains our custom commands (usually support/commands.ts). This file should contain all of your commands as well as a Cypress namespace with a Chainable Interface. It is in this Interface we will add a reference to our custom command(s).
declare namespace Cypress {
  interface Chainable {
    getBySel(selector: string): Chainable
  }
}

Cypress.Commands.add(&#x27;getBySel&#x27;, (selector: string, ...args: any[]): Cypress.CanReturnChainable &#x3D;&gt; {
  return cy.get(&#x60;[data-test&#x3D;${selector}]&#x60;, ...args)
})

And voilà our Cypress application is happy and now has full support for Typescript!

                    <span>Why Python packaging can be hard


There may be a time in your development career where you need to author a package that extends Python w/ C or C++. In such a case your Python package needs to go through a compilation process, which converts C or C++ to binaries that work for a specific target system. This becomes really tedious when you think about how many flavors and versions of Linux there are.  Building a separate binary for Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, etc... Ugh so tiring.
Why Python packaging can be easy w/ manylinux


Fortunately, there is a solution. manylinux was birthed to make it easy for your Python packages to be compatible with most Linux variants. manylinux takes advantage of the fact that most distributions are mindful of backwards compatibility, and intentionally builds bdist wheels on an old version of a distribution. The idea is that if we build on an old supported version, the binaries produced are compatible with current versions.
So what is a manylinux really? Is it a ham sandwich?


No. Even better. It&#x27;s a Docker image. manylinux is a Docker image built off a certain old versions of the CentOS operating system that comes bundled with libraries that are assumed to be present by default on almost all Linux systems.
You can find an example of manylinux distributions within the pandas project. Here are two (out of many) from the list of available pandas downloads from PyPI:
pandas-1.0.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
pandas-1.0.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_i686.whl

In this case, pandas has built manylinux wheels for CPython 3.7 supporting both x86-64 and i686 architectures. It&#x27;s manylinux so this wheel should be compatible for many linux :)
Happy packaging!</span>

                    <span>Introduction


I watched this video by Linus Tech Tips, and decided to improve on his criticisms to hopefully create a better guide to choosing your Linux gaming distro.
These are some common terms to know: 
DE/Desktop Environment: This is the GUI interface to your OS.
Terminal/TTY/Command Line: This is the text based interface to your OS.
As Linux is Free and Open Source Software, you can customize anything and everything you want on any distro. However, as this is a beginner focused guide, it mostly focuses on what is built in to a distro, not what is possible with a distro.
POP!_OS


This distribution is simple to use, has a nice DE, and generally doesn&#x27;t get in your way. The breakage caused while installing linux in Linus&#x27; video is something that is trivial to fix. You can expect it to…</span>

                    <span>VS Code 🤯


VS Code seems to be the 1 size fit all code editor. VS Code offers really seamless integration to develop on a remote connection such as the WSL 2 with the simple installation of an extension.
If you don&#x27;t have it already, install VS Code from the official site. 

(You can also download the insiders build if you like living on the bleeding edge)
While installing VS Code, make sure to check the Add to Path option.

All you need to do is install the Remote - WSL Extension

Start a WSL 2 remote session
Ctrl + Shift + P and type in new wsl window to open up a new WSL 2 window and select the option

A new WSL 2 window should open up from the directory you were using.

It is advised to use VS Code from the Linux file system instead of the windows&#x27;. To do this just use the Open Folder option from the File menu.
Just traverse to ~ or $HOME directory and then add the projects to the Linux file system and use them from there.

Upon opening any projects in WSL window, you will see the WSL 2.0  connection on the bottom-left as well as the title bar.

Un usuario promedio no se preocupa por lo que pasa detrás de un sistema operativo pero nosotros que somos desarrolladores deberíamos entender como funcionan el software en conjunto con el hardware ya que es muy importante aunque no siempre se necesita este conocimiento hasta que te pones a la tarea.
Aquí es donde comienza la premisa ¿por donde comienzo? e internet te responde: ¡descargando el software por supuesto!.
