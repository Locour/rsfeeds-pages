                    <span>One of the most powerful features when creating Angular components is the Async Pipe. The greatest thing about it is that it allows you to take advantage of asynchronous rendering in your templates, but without having to worry about subscribing and unsubscribing from Observables.
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;
import { of, Subject } from &#x27;rxjs&#x27;;
import { delay, startWith, takeUntil } from &#x27;rxjs/operators&#x27;;

@Component({
  selector: &#x27;my-app&#x27;,
  template: &#x60;
    
Async example
 
    
Items
 
    
{{item}}
Other Items
 
    
{{other}}
 this.otherItems &#x3D; other)
  }
  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.destroy$.next();
    this.destroy$.complete();
  }
}


Check it out on Stackblitz.
As you can see, in the first example, we are rendering a list (items) using the async pipe in the HTML template. There is no need for the additional handling after the component is destroyed, which you can see is not the case for the other list otherItems.   That is simply because the async pipe is going to take care of that for you.</span>

                    <span>Let&#x27;s know here Top 10 Angular Version 12 Features for Streamlining Development Process
1. Ivy Everywhere
In Angular 12, View Engine is deprecated, and the community is working on ongoing delivery towards the goal of amalgamating the ecosystem of Angular on Ivy. Current libraries still use View Engine. But the library authors want to shift to Ivy. AngularJS development services become easy with Ivy as developers can compile all components independently and enhances development times.
2. Adios Protractor
The Angular team is working to decide Protractor’s future. They are currently exploring the given feedbacks in RFC. The team decided to remove it in further new tasks and more furnished alternatives along with third-party solutions. They are working with webdriverIO, TestCafe, and Cypress t…</span>

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(2 min)</span>
                    <span>As we know multiple components share the common data and always need updated shared data. In such scenarios most of the time BehaviorSubject is used which acts as a single store to hold updated shared data.
BehaviorSubject is both observer and type of observable.
BehaviorSubject always need an initial/default value.
Every observer on subscribe gets current value.
Current value is either latest value emitted by source observable using next() method or initial/default value.
Let’s implement BehaviorSubject to understand a concept better!
For e.g In order tracking app, display total items in cart and total items in wish list on UI in header and dashboard section based on user action.
Now we have three components -

Run Live
When user add items in the cart/wishList, total count needs to be updated in the header and dashboard component.
1.First create a BehaviorSubject in order service which holds the initial state of order count ,so that it can be used by any component.




3.When a user performs any action, call the next() method of source observable. When the next() method gets called it will update current count with new count and notifies updated count to all observers(3 Components) who subscribed to source observable.

This way BehaviorSubject makes components communication more effective.

                    <span>How Do External Teams Talk to Each Other?


Pods are ephemeral resources. Deployments can dynamically generate and destroy pods. Because pods are unstable, transient, and volatile, we can’t trust that the application will always be reachable via a pod’s IP.
In Kubernetes, a service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. The set of pods targeted by a service is usually determined by a selector. Kubernetes services provide addresses through which associated pods can be accessed.
Take a look at the service.yaml file below:
app:myapp.

  
  
  Creating a Kubernetes Service




kubectl apply -f service.yaml

The minikube tunnel command can be used to expose LoadBalancer services. To keep the LoadBalancer active, it must be run in a separate terminal window.
minikube tunnel 

minikube tunnel runs as a process on the host and creates a network route to the cluster’s service CIDR using the cluster’s IP address as a gateway. The tunnel command gives any application on the host operating system immediate access to the external IP address.
kubectl get service myapp

You should be able to see the external ip; earlier it would have been pending.
minikube service --url myapp

You should be able to view this in your browser.
Welcome to myapp!
The section about services is incomplete without an analogy from the dev life. 
It’s Been a Long Article… and I Hope To Tell You More About It Next Time!
With that, we come to the end of the series on K8s made relatable and the adventures of the fresher on the first day. However there is more to be learned, and more adventures to follow, so stay tuned!

In the previous articles, we have discussed about containers &amp; images and how to run containers on docker. We discussed about the need for Kubernetes. In this article, we will take a closer look at K8s and why it is so essential.
Kubernetes is an open source container management and deployment platform. It orchestrates virtual machine clusters and schedules containers to operate on those virtual machines depending on their available computational resources and the container’s resource needs. 
They can be related with managers, who plan and coordinate developers to deliver projects and make sure they have all the resources required to do so.
We can use K8s to deploy our services, roll out new releases without downtime, and scale (or descale) those services. It is portable, exte…</span>

Pull Request(PR) are often when raised are not properly documented. The best way to document them is to use a consistent template. The Template will help the team to document the PR in a concise way. PR reviewer gets an idea about what to expect in a PR.
Create a file pull_request_template.md inside a root folder of the repository called ./github
./github/pull_request_template.md

This file is nothing but a template that will be shown on GitHub PR, when the PR is raised.

                    <span>Welcome back to the second part of this series. 
Docker is a well-known runtime environment for creating and building applications within containers. It deploys containerized applications or software in different environments, from development to testing and production, using Docker images.
Let’s create a basic Go application that we will use to deploy on our minikube cluster.
go mod init 
go mod tidy

To create the dockerfile for our application, we will refer to this:
For building the docker image, run the following command in the terminal:
docker build --tag myapp .
docker images

You should be able to see the newly created myapp image in the list.
To publish a port for our container, we’ll use the --publish flag (-p for short) on the docker run command. The format of the --publish command is [host_port]:[container_port]. So if we wanted to expose port 8080 inside the container to port 3000 outside the container, we would pass 3000:8080 to the --publish flag.
docker run -d -p 8080:10000 myapp

Open localhost:8080 in the terminal; it should say
We saw how useful containers can be for running applications in an isolated way, on any environment. However, in production, hundreds to thousands of different containers may be required.
Container runtime systems like Docker benefit from the usage of additional technologies to orchestrate or manage all of the containers in use.
This orchestration is handled by Kubernetes.
In the next part, we will explore what Kubernetes is and how it works.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently come across Gitpod. Gitpod provides cloud-based development environments. They&#x27;re similar to GitHub Codespaces, but in my opinion offer a better experience. Setting up an environment is simpler and they are all about ephemerality. The idea is that each environment just lives for the duration of the task you&#x27;re working on, and then you throw it away. Like Codespaces, Gitpod uses the Visual Studio Code editor, which you can access with your browser.
I&#x27;m slowly adding Gitpod to all of my projects, because the development experience is much better than doing it on my local machine.
For one of my Rails projects, I had some issues getting the Rubocop linter to work. Here&#x27;s a short set up guide to so that others can avoid the problem I had.

                    <span>Here&#x27;s a quick one, and it may be obvious to some of you but I didn&#x27;t know about it. I noticed that my Rails app (Fugu) kept logging out all users after every deployment.
First, I thought it&#x27;s an issue with Devise, but it turns out that it&#x27;s related to a variabled called secret_key_base that Rails uses to sign and encrypt cookies (among other things).
For production, there are multiple places to define secret_key_base. A glance at the Rails soure code shows that Rails looks for it in ENV[&quot;SECRET_KEY_BASE&quot;], credentials.secret_key_base, or secrets.secret_key_base.
In my case, I hadn&#x27;t set up any credentials or secrets, nor was I providing an environment variable.
Digital Ocean (and, as it looks, Heroku) automatically sets the SECRET_KEY_BASE environment variable for you, and it changes with every deployment. And this was the problem. After each deployment, my Rails app couldn&#x27;t decrypt the existing session cookies anymore beause secret_key_base had a different value, and my users needed to log in again.
To solve the problem, just provide a SECRET_KEY_BASE environment variable in your production server. The simplest way to generate it is to run rake secret in your terminal (make sure you&#x27;re in a Rails project folder).</span>

I hope you might be aware of blockchain which is an emerging technology in today’s modern world. This technology is widely used in many industries like banking, insurance, finance, decentralized platforms, healthcare, and more. Many people didn’t believe in blockchain technology before the birth of Bitcoin. But after Bitcoin’s arrival, many people started embracing it. 
The most notable characteristic of blockchain technology is that it acts like a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Therefore, the data and information will be recorded in the network. The transparency, privacy, and security maintained over the network made everyon…</span>

                    <span>Hi everyone. I&#x27;ve been fighting with VSCode for almost two weeks now.
VSC keeps freezing my whole system randomly while working.
FiveServer
Pretier
Aura Theme
Tabnine (free)
I&#x27;ve tried working with and without extensions, with the same result.
I&#x27;ve even tried to run VSC from console with --disable-gpu attr.
Freezing is random. Sometimes while typing, sometimes when switching windows between VSC and FF.
First thought there is a problem with FF but then it froze wit only VSC lunched :/
Does anyone had the same problem?
I really liked working with VSC.
I&#x27;ve tried Atom as a replacement, but not like it so much.
WEBSTORM is cool but it&#x27;s overkill for me for now.</span>

                    <span>Hello Folks 👋 , Ankit here so now let&#x27;s have a quick look at the most used and favourite command among linux users i.e the history command.
In your shell, there is a history of the commands that you previously entered, you can actually look through these commands. This is quite useful when you want to find and run a command you used previously without actually typing it again.
$ history
Some Shortcut tricks and Wow factors of history Command
↑ ---&gt; we can also use the upper arrow key to run the previous commands
!! ---&gt; if you want to run the command that you used earlier without writing the whole command you can just type in this !!
Next in the list is ctrl - R 
ctrl - R ---&gt; this is the reverse search command . so how it works is simple you have to press ctrl r and then you can write some parts of the command for e.g :- you write ls and then you pressed ctrl - R again so what it will do is it will show you the matches and you can just navigate through them by pressing ctrl -r again
our terminal is getting a little cluttered so to clear up the display we can use the below command 👇👇👇
clear 
So now if we are talking about so much useful features of the linux without tab completion how can my article be completed 😅😅
Tab-Completion ---&gt; So how it works is if you type chr or firef and then press tab it will autocomplete the command like if u typed chr it will autocomplete the command with chrome 

So that was all from my side . Have a great day ahead  ✌✌</span>

                    <span>Firefox Beta


Firefox 除了一般的版本之外，還另外有 Beta、Developer、Nightly 版，這些額外的預覽版本是用來供應給網頁開發者等等的早期用戶，這些早期用戶可以透過預覽版的 Firefox 來測試新的網頁技術，當然既然是預覽版那麼它們的穩定性一定是不如一般版的，喜歡嚐鮮或工作上對新的網頁技術有需求的朋友可以斟酌安裝。
elementary OS 是以 Ubuntu Desktop 為基礎，再改用 elementary OS 自己的桌面環境而來，提供了比原本 Ubuntu Desktop 更美觀也更友善的桌面體驗，並且依然保留了 Ubuntu 的系統架構與沿用 Debian 流派的套件管理系統 APT，所以網路上對 Debian / Ubuntu 的文章大多也可以適用於 elementary OS。
前面提到過 elemantary OS 是基於 Ubuntu 的，並且也是用 APT 作為套件管理系統，因此若要安裝普通版的 Firefox，則只要一行簡單的指令：
sudo apt install firefox

因為普通版的 Firefox 有被收錄在 Ubuntu 的套件庫內，而 elementary OS 也是有沿用 Ubuntu 的套件庫，才能安裝的這麼輕鬆寫意。
然而如果想嘗試 Firefox Beta，你會發現好像有難度，在 Firefox Beta 的下載頁雖然有列出 Linux 版的下載包，但是它只提供 .tar.bz2 的壓縮包，雖然解開免安裝就可以用，但並未整合入 elementary OS 的 app 選單內，有點像以前 Windows 上的綠色軟體，但這不是我想要的，本人還是較偏好與 OS 能夠做到整合的做法，因此我們必須手動把 Firefox Beta 的 PPA 套件庫加入系統內。
PPA，即 Personal Package Archive，是讓任何大眾可以寄存自己的 DEB 套件的平台，最大的 PPA 平台 Launchpad 也是由 Ubuntu 背後的公司 Canonical 所營運的。
Firefox Beta PPA 的專案頁面。裡面的說明有教導我們如何把這個 PPA 套件庫加入我們的 elementary OS 之內，依照頁面的指示加入 PPA 套件庫：
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/firefox-next

然後重整套件庫清單：
sudo apt update

最後安裝 Firefox Beta：
sudo apt install firefox

注意到，套件的名稱還是 firefox，也就是說這個 PPA 內的 Firefox Beta 的套件名稱還是 firefox，並且取代了原本 Ubuntu 套件庫的那個普通版的 firefox。
安裝完之後我們的系統內的 Firefox 應該就會被取代成 Firefox Beta。</span>

Yes, we will not use any backend service, even a serverless function. We will access Redis from the client side directly. This is possible with the read only REST API provided by Upstash.

npm i -D @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties @babel/plugin-transform-runtime @babel/preset-env 

touch .babelrc

Paste the following content in .babelrc
{

    &quot;plugins&quot;: [&quot;@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties&quot;, &quot;@babel/transform-runtime&quot;]

Babel is not a compiler or interpreter it is just a transpiler so we have to transpile es6 to es5 using babel then we have to execute that transpiled code. For that we can write npm script.
Add the following script to package.json
&quot;build&quot;: &quot;babel src -d dist&quot;,
&quot;start&quot;: &quot;npm run build &amp;&amp; node dist&quot;

Now create src folder and start writing es6+ code inside that folder. Run npm start it will create dist folder inside that folder we can find transpiled code.
Cheers!!!</span>

                    <span>When we talk about the server-side programming language, both Node.js and PHP are tough competitors and are highly popular because of their performance, security and compatibility. However, you cannot choose both for your application and will have to work with one. Let&#x27;s dive deep into Node.js vs PHP and which one will be an ideal choice for web development. 
Fast server connection
Node.js allows developers to build non-blocking input/output Javascript applications with the help of an event queue that can handle numerous requests at the same time. Javascript has a built-in asynchrony that enables scalable server applications that can handle several requests much more than the general multithreaded servers. 
Node.js has an execution speed higher than PHP, and speed is critical for your web …</span>

Security best practices and technologies change, so refreshing your understanding and keeping up with current best practices is a good thing. Here are some notes I took while I reviewed my knowledge and applied my experience implementing auth.

If you&#x27;re implementing authentication to a new application, the best practice is to use OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect (OIDC). The combination of OAuth 2.0 with OIDC provides consistency across many integration providers, standardi…</span>

Hello, and welcome!
It&#x27;s another Friday. Let&#x27;s get down to business.
Most of the news that we&#x27;ll review this week is about vulnerabilities and bugs.
Popular NPM Package Hijacked to Publish Crypto-mining Malware


As a developer, reading articles like this makes me think twice before downloading a package from NPM, but sometimes, you might need that package so bad, you&#x27;ll forget about &quot;security&quot;.
Excerpt from the article:
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Friday warned of crypto-mining and password-stealing malware embedded in &quot;UAParser.js,&quot; a popular JavaScript NPM library with over 6 million weekly downloads, days after the NPM repository moved to get rid of three rogue packages that were found to mimic the same library

                    <span>Many people are concerned about how much personal information is stored on the internet and could be stolen or misused in today&#x27;s reality. You&#x27;re not the only one who feels this way. The issue of online privacy is crucial.
You can improve your online security against unwanted access to your data and privacy by taking several simple actions.
1 
Browse in private mode or use a browser, which doesn&#x27;t store and send your data.
Browsing in private mode can let you avoid your browser&#x27;s history from tracing. However, these private modes aren&#x27;t entirely private. Your ISP can observe your surfing behavior even if you&#x27;re using an incognito or private mode.
e.g.
https://www.brave.com/
https://www.beakerbrowser.com/
2 
Be cautious about where you click.
Phishing attempts are one of the ways how hackers can compromise your online privacy. They frequently accomplish this by sending fake emails that look like from banks, credit card companies, etc. 
3 
Change your search engine.
If you&#x27;re like most web users, you use Google as your primary search engine.
e.g.
https://www.duckduckgo.com/
https://www.startpage.com/
4
Use dedicated proxy servers. 
A dedicated proxy server acts as a private and secure connection point between users and the internet. It&#x27;s a server that acts as an &quot;intermediary&quot; between end-users and the web pages they browse on the internet. An IP address is used when a computer connects to the internet.
You can compare it to your home&#x27;s street address. It directs data to the appropriate destination while also providing a return address for other devices.
A dedicated proxy server is a machine connected to the internet that has its unique IP address and serves as a disguise for your computer.
There are plenty of companies that provide such services, here is my personal top of the most reliable ones:

Welcome to the fifth, and last, Type | Treat challenge! These challenges are a series of blog posts which have 2 code challenges in, one for beginners and one for intermediate TypeScript programmers. We&#x27;re on day five, which means going over the answers from yesterday and have 2 new challenges.
This challenge aimed to be generics 101, first introducing the concept of making your function pass a type from the function to the argument:
-  function getBowl(items: any) {
+  function getBowl(items: T) {
      return { items }
  }

The any acted as hint clue about where to look, and this example is almost the first code sample on the Generics chapter in the Handbook, so it felt like a good intro.
The second part involved understanding generic constraints, these are …</span>

                    <span>Introduction


In this blog, we are going to look at, How to set up Storybooks with React and my all-time favourite language(TypeScript). 
Storybook is a UI development tool that lets you preview your components in a very rich library design that will help you to change all props for the component and test out your component in different scenarios. 
Maybe you should only use storybook if you&#x27;re creating a component library(Open Source or for organisation). As for me, I created a component library for my organisation which is supposed to be used across multiple react projects. There I implemented Storybook(in component library project) so that everyone can have a preview of all components provided by the internal-component-library and use it according to the (kind of) storybook generated docs based on props.
Make sure you have installed or created a new react project with
npx create-react-app storybook-ts-blog

Now storybook can handle the setup part, just run the below command.
npx sb init

It will install storybook and add the necessary files for you to work with storybook.
Run storybook using below command
npm run storybook

Maybe you should also host the component library even if it&#x27;s an internal project as it will help anyone other than devs(designers, managers) to have a look at your mess🤪(just kidding, I mean your components), just add basic authentication(username+password) before showing the hosted website.
To generate HTML files to host, run the below command
npm run build-storybook -- -o ./path/to/build

To run the build locally, use this command
npx http-server ./path/to/build</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a little side project which I ultimate decide to make public so that somebody else can maybe benefit from it on their own projects. typed is similar to superstruct and zod in that it validates data at runtime and it&#x27;s type-safe but what&#x27;s different about it is that it comes in a tiny package (1kb) with an ESM build and it also outperforms them by a significant amount. If you&#x27;re curious about it you can check it out on GitHub or NPM.

A blazing fast, dependency free, 1kb runtime type-checking library written entirely in typescript, meant to be used with it.
There are dozens of validation libraries out there, so why create yet another one? Well, I tried almost every library out there and there is only one that I really like called superstruct (which is awesome) that provides almost everything that I want, but still, I wanted to create my own. The others are simply bloated or don&#x27;t provide proper typescript support. So that&#x27;s where typed comes in.
typed is all about function composition. Each function is &quot;standalone&quot; and provides a safe way to validate data, you don&#x27;t need a special kind of function to execute a schema against some value. All functions return a special type which is either Success or Failure. If success is true then value is available and fully typed and if not, errors is…

                    <span>Let&#x27;s know here Top 10 Angular Version 12 Features for Streamlining Development Process
1. Ivy Everywhere
In Angular 12, View Engine is deprecated, and the community is working on ongoing delivery towards the goal of amalgamating the ecosystem of Angular on Ivy. Current libraries still use View Engine. But the library authors want to shift to Ivy. AngularJS development services become easy with Ivy as developers can compile all components independently and enhances development times.
2. Adios Protractor
The Angular team is working to decide Protractor’s future. They are currently exploring the given feedbacks in RFC. The team decided to remove it in further new tasks and more furnished alternatives along with third-party solutions. They are working with webdriverIO, TestCafe, and Cypress t…</span>

                    <span>As we know multiple components share the common data and always need updated shared data. In such scenarios most of the time BehaviorSubject is used which acts as a single store to hold updated shared data.
BehaviorSubject is both observer and type of observable.
BehaviorSubject always need an initial/default value.
Every observer on subscribe gets current value.
Current value is either latest value emitted by source observable using next() method or initial/default value.
Let’s implement BehaviorSubject to understand a concept better!
For e.g In order tracking app, display total items in cart and total items in wish list on UI in header and dashboard section based on user action.
Now we have three components -

Run Live
When user add items in the cart/wishList, total count needs to be updated in the header and dashboard component.
1.First create a BehaviorSubject in order service which holds the initial state of order count ,so that it can be used by any component.




3.When a user performs any action, call the next() method of source observable. When the next() method gets called it will update current count with new count and notifies updated count to all observers(3 Components) who subscribed to source observable.

This way BehaviorSubject makes components communication more effective.

                    <span>There is too much info on this so I am splitting it into a series.
Sometimes we render components conditionally in frontend applications, and sometimes these conditions are based on authenticated users having certain permissions.
It should also be noted that under no circumstances no sensible data should rely on frontend permission checks, as they are laughably easy bypassed by anyone why has a tiniest desire to do so.
So if you are hiding checkbox with admin rights behind some if statement on the frontend without checking permissions for the action on the backend, you better cease reading this article and hurry to do something about that timebomb.
Yet, I digress. So let us imagine what tools we want in our application for checking user permissions.

                    <span>Merge conflicts... Nobody likes them. Some of us even fear them. But they are a fact of life when you&#x27;re working with Git, especially when you&#x27;re teaming up with other developers. In most cases, merge conflicts aren&#x27;t as scary as you might think. In this fourth part of our “Advanced Git” series we&#x27;ll talk about when they can happen, what they actually are, and how to solve them.

                    <span>Setting aliases can help you type more efficiently and work faster. In this article, I will explain what aliases are and how to set them from the beginning. And finally, I will introduce some aliases that will help you in your coding life.
Understand what an alias is
Set your first alias and use it
Custom some other useful aliases
In the following, I will use the term &quot;terminal&quot; regardless of the type of shell, assuming a UNIX-like OS environment such as Mac or Linux.
As it turns out, aliases are like shortcut keys in the terminal.
command+x  to cut text and command+v to paste on Macbook, the terminal also has shortcuts.
git branch is one of the most common commands to see what branch you are on. However, typing git branch every time is a bit tedious, isn&#x27;t it? So, if you create an alias, …</span>

I recently updated my Ubuntu Gnome desktop to look somewhat like MacOs. (or at least what I think looks like MacOS 😄 😄)
The process was quite straightforward, and apart from a couple of minor issues, I feel it is quite good to use.
Also mandatory disclaimer for Linux posts : Yes you can customize anything to look like anything, I chose this way , but you might be able to do it in some different way.
Even though this looks great, and personally I didn&#x27;t feel any problems when using it on daily basis, I did encounter some issues :

                    <span>Containers have become ubiquitous in software development, especially in cloud deployments. 92% of respondents to the 2020 CNCF survey said that they use containers in production. But what are containers really, and why has this technology led to one of the biggest software trends over the last decade?
Docker isn’t magic: it just packages features of the Linux kernel in a user-friendly way, and it&#x27;s not the only software that exposes those capabilities. It&#x27;s also important to understand that containers are not the same as &quot;lightweight VMs&quot;. No containerization or virtualization technology is a silver bullet, and the more you understand what they are doing under the hood, the less likely you are to shoot yourself in the foot with that non-silver bullet.

Hey guys, have you ever wondered how to seed some mock data to your MongoDB database, whether for development/demo purposes or in actual production app? In this article, I will show you the easiest way to populate MongoDB database with very little code, and no, you wouldn&#x27;t use fancy methods like the following ones.

// a bunch of codes go here...
import connectDb from &quot;./utils/connectDb.js&quot;;

// MongoDB database connection
connectDb();

// To recognize incoming request as JSON object
app.use(express.json());
// a bunch of codes go here...

                    <span>I have a few questions and looking for opinions on the approaches to build and protect a RestAPI server to handle miscellaneous tasks using an API KEY.  What I’m not looking for is “use this paid/free service or zapier” and what I am looking for is your opinion on how to implement this via code with NodeJs / Express / DB. I’m trying to level up my coding knowledge and learn more about various design and architectures decisions while trying to do cool things with the business logic side. 
Sample use case:
What I’ve come up with:
Create a new Key { id, Api Key, HOST URL } in the DB 
In the html request - Use Header X-Api-key and host URL is not public but known on the server.
Endpoint receives request
Looks up Api key &amp; host in DB
If valid, next() in the function
If not, return 403 error “not Valid”
Next function implements business logics / transforms data. 
In your opinion:

                    <span>A HTTP cookie is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user&#x27;s web browser. The browser may then store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests.
Cookies are used typically to tell if two HTTP requests come from the same browser/user. So for session management, tracking and to a lesser extent personalization
For general data storage on the client, there are more modern APIs.
When client(browser) and the server communicate with HTTP calls (GET, POST etc) the calls include content, or a body and headers
The headers contain a lot of information on the request or response currently being transported. Things like content type, cache control and user agent. Headers are present both when client mades a request to the server, and when the server responds.

Yeah, I hate it too.
Today, I want to talk about building applications on top of data warehouses. I want to discuss how to achieve low latency if your app is consuming data from BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, or any other cloud-based data warehouse.
My goal is to give you a crash course into data warehouse performance, explain how to understand the performance of data APIs and highlight a few tools that help build responsive apps on top of data warehouses.
Broadly speaking, data warehouses are central locations for data from multiple sources. Call it a single source of truth. It&#x27;s up to you to set up a process to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from source systems based on a schedule or a set of events. Then you usually run reporting and data analysi…</span>

                    <span>I decided that my first project for this would be a rework of one of my openClassrooms project: the social media site (link if you&#x27;re interested )
Yesterday I created a postgres database in Heroku and modified some of my code to connect with it via sequelize, nothing big but I noticed a problem: I initially made the decision to put pictures ( user&#x27;s avatar and posts ) in the database using the blob type. Well PostgreSQL doesn&#x27;t support Blob format and even if it did, the size of the database hosted on the free tier of Heroku is limited, and I&#x27;m still quite poor at the moment so in this version, pictures will go in a folder on the backend.

                    <span>MedSec is a network and pentest utility that I developed so that I could perform different kinds of task using the same suite, instead of jumping from one tool to another.
Currently, this script can perform a good variety of tasks such as ifconfig, ping, traceroute, port scans (including SYN, TCP, UDP, ACK, comprehensive scan, host discovery (scan for up devices on a local network), MAC address detection (get MAC address of a host IP on a local network), banner grabbing, DNS checks (with geolocation information), WHOIS, subdomain enumeration, vulnerability reconnaissance, packet sniffing, MAC spoofing, IP spoofing, SYN flooding, deauth attack and brute-force attack (beta).
Other features are still being implemented. Future implementations may include WAF detection, DNS enumeration, traffic analysis, XSS vulnerability scanner, ARP cache poisoning, DNS cache poisoning, MAC flooding, ping of death, network disassociation attack (not deauth attack), OSINT, exploits, some automated tasks and others.
If you want to become a contributor, make a pull request or issue.
Waiting for your feedback. Kudos

                    <span>Introduction


The security alarm system will use a bipolar junction transistor switch to detect security problems. Theft attempt and other security threats can be controlled by using this simple circuit.
For the purpose of this application, we will design a security system for one room in a house. The sensor used for each opening can be either a mechanical switch, a magnetically operated switch, or an optical sensor. Detection of an intrusion can be used to initiate an audible alarm signal. 
We will be using a mechanical switch as our sensor and use a transistor as a NOT gate, so that when there is an open switch in our room a transistor will show a signal that an intruder has entered.
Resistor
Transistor
Buzzer
Voltage source

Room sensor is normally in a closed position and it is connected to a DC voltage source. When a door is open it creates an open circuit.


Transistor switches are used for high power devices such as
The areas of operation for Transistor switch are known as the Saturation Region and the Cut-Off Region.
Cut-off Region: here there is a large depletion layer


Saturation Region: here the depletion layer is as




  
  
  NOT Gate Transistor


A NOT gate simply inverts its input. If the input is high, the output is low, and if the input is low, the output is high

The operation of this circuit is simple. The input is connected through resistor R2 to the transistor’s
When voltage is present at the input, the transistor turns on, allowing current to flow through the collector-emitter circuit directly to ground. This ground path creates a shortcut that bypasses the output, which causes the output to go low.
We run our simulation with a voltmeter connected to the output, in place of the buzzer .

In the normal state, the switch will be closed.

When intrusion happens, the switch will open and the alarm (buzzer) will go off.</span>

Welcome to the fourth Type | Treat challenge! These challenges are a series of blog posts which have 2 code challenges in, one for beginners and one for intermediate TypeScript programmers. We&#x27;re on day four, which means going over the answers from yesterday and have 2 new challenges.
I wonder if we over-indexed on the difficulty here, and we&#x27;re interested if you dropped off somewhere through this task because we had less submissions than usual for this challenge. The goal was to have you build out a template string literal type which accounted for string input which roughly matched how CSS&#x27;s stringy variables worked.

                    <span>In Javascript, Promise.all lets you execute a bunch of Promises in parallel and get an array of results back.
const responses &#x3D; await Promise.all([
  fetch(&quot;/api/1&quot;),
  fetch(&quot;/api/2&quot;)
])

Pretty straight forward.  However, if you were to do the above with 100 fetch calls instead, you might accidentally take down your server in a self-inflicted Denial of Service attack. Even if you protect against this in the API with rate-limiting, you&#x27;re still going to see a lot of errors for failed requests as you scale up.
APIs are the exception.  Most types of external calls have no concept of rate-limiting at all - filesystem operations, system calls, etc.
For example, in NodeJS you can spawn new shells to call out to other programs on the computer. I use this in my open source A/B testing platform G…</span>

Scramjet Transform Hub allows you to deploy and run multiple data processing apps called sequences. 
Sequences are specific apps, not just any apps. They specialize in the efficient data processing.
STH can be treated both as a data processing engine and execution platform for multiple sequences running on the same platform and performing various data processing tasks. 
We named our apps &quot;sequences&quot; and that term describes well its nature, as they process data through a sequence of chained functions. Therefore usually, our sequences are concise and easy to write ,and powerful at the same time.
Our vanilla STH engine is based on Node.js and thus allows developers to benefit from the rich ecosystem and many packages and solutions provided b…</span>

And I actually kind of like them, because when you build several REST APIs, then you find it very interesting and you keep on discovering many things. The people who have built REST APIs will understand what I am trying to express here. 
But since a long time I have been hearing about this new guy (at least new for me, actually its quite oldish) called GraphQL. They say that it can build the most efficient APIs. No API, including REST and SOAP APIs, are as good and efficient as GraphQL, because unlike REST, GraphQL has a single endpoint and gives you a flexible approach of fetching data from the server as a client. Just ask for what you need. Its like the objective type question that a client asks a server, the specific word or the…</span>

Our Scramjet data apps engine has its approach to deploying and running serverless applications; in several aspects different from solutions in areas such as software buses, integration platforms, and FaaS offerings. This article explains our approach. We hope you might find it interesting.
The heart of our solution and its data engine is called “Scramjet Transform Hub”. It’s available as a standalone software package on GitHub and will be the core element of our Scramjet Cloud Platform.
We name our approach “3 in 1 data processing platform” as it combines 3 concepts into one solution:

serverless data applications

                    <span>In the “Leveraging Salesforce Using Spring Boot” article, I navigated the course for introducing a Spring Boot service that would leverage the well-established Salesforce RESTful API. The goal of this service was to act as a middleware layer; that way, clients not written in Salesforce could retrieve and update contact data stored in Salesforce. This backend service implemented its own caching layer to provide a faster response time and also cut down on the number of times Salesforce needed to be called.
In “Leveraging Salesforce Using a Client Written In Svelte,” I introduced a simple client written in Svelte, which made it possible to update the Salesforce data using an inline editor—again, without actually using the Salesforce client.

                    <span>Today&#x27;s topic is Confirmation dialog box in Angular. It&#x27;s been a while since my last post, and this one might be pretty useful for Angular developers. In the following several passages I&#x27;ll try to answer several questions:
What is the confirmation box in Angular? 


What is the best confirmation dialog for Angular, and why? 


How to integrate it into any Angular project?


How it looks like?







  
  
  What is the confirmation box in Angular?


It is a simple popup that prevents unwanted actions, for example when the user clicks the delete button, the popup dialog should appear with the question: &quot;Are you sure you want to delete item data?&quot; and two buttons &quot;Confirm&quot; and &quot;Decline&quot;. That is an enhanced level of security needed in almost every professional application. 
It is the ngx-awesome-popup an open-source library made for Angular. It provides highly scalable options and styles to adapt to any angular project. The best part is it&#x27;s callable only from typescript so it can be used directly in services without HTML templates and it uses observables. 

npm i @costlydeveloper/ngx-awesome-popup



imports: [

    NgxAwesomePopupModule.forRoot(), 

    ConfirmBoxConfigModule.forRoot()

]



confirmBox() {

        const confirmBox &#x3D; new ConfirmBoxInitializer();

        confirmBox.setTitle(&#x27;Are you sure?&#x27;);

        confirmBox.setMessage(&#x27;Confirm to delete user: John Doe!&#x27;);

        confirmBox.setButtonLabels(&#x27;YES&#x27;, &#x27;NO&#x27;);



        // Choose layout color type

        confirmBox.setConfig({

            LayoutType: DialogLayoutDisplay.DANGER // SUCCESS | INFO | NONE | DANGER | WARNING

        });



        // Simply open the popup and listen which button is clicked

        confirmBox.openConfirmBox$().subscribe(resp &#x3D;&gt; {

            // do some action after user click on a button

            console.log(&#x27;Clicked button response: &#x27;, resp);

        });

    }

                    <span>Single page web applications built with the help of various front-end frameworks like angular, react and Vuejs have a large number of third party open source frameworks which can give great support towards achieving a lot of large functionalities and modules including user-interface, tables and grids, forms and validations, translations and a lot more..

The development approach refers to the model adopted by the owner, people and contributors. To look at the pattern and history of the contributors on how did they work on it or why have they designed this approach for the framework. For tech geeks it is easy to identify it as for open source repositories it is very easy to look into branches, codes and commits.

                    <span>If we use OnPush change detection strategy, immutability is helpful to ensure change detection works expectedly. 
One of the way to enforce immutability is using Immutable.js. However, using Immutable.js is not really straightforward. It adds another layer instead of using JS object directly e.g
const apps &#x3D; List([{ name: &#x27;slack&#x27; }, { name: &#x27;skype&#x27; }]);
apps.get(0); // { name: &#x27;slack&#x27; }

const app &#x3D; Map({ name: &#x27;slack&#x27; });
map.get(&quot;name&quot;); // &#x27;slack&#x27;

// Using Record if we want to access property directly
const AppRecord &#x3D; Record({
    name: &#x27;&#x27;
});

class App extends AppRecord {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }
}

const newApp &#x3D; new App({ name: &#x27;slack&#x27; });
newApp.name; // &#x27;slack&#x27;

We have to use get when using List and Map. Using Record could solve the issue, but if we have a very large object, using Record will be hard to maintain because we need to create each record per object and it&#x27;s nested object.
Other issue is about JS compatibility because it needs to use fromJS and toJS methods to convert from and to JS object. 
I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;m not a fan of that lib and it makes things more complicated. 
Other possible approach I&#x27;m thinking of: 
readonly + ESLint immutable


Since Angular using Typescript, let&#x27;s use Readonly, ReadonlyArray to enforce immutability. 
Also add this no-mutation ESLint rule as extra protection https://github.com/jonaskello/eslint-plugin-functional/blob/master/docs/rules/immutable-data.md
is there any better approach?

                    <span>Security is hard. It&#x27;s hard because there are so many things that can go wrong along the way. Attackers only need to find one small gap to make it through whereas developers and IT Pros have to think about all the possible attack permutations and potential security vulnerabilities every step of the way. That&#x27;s why we talk about &quot;security in layers&quot; when it comes to building systems that handle sensitive data. And unless you&#x27;re creating static marketing pages, it&#x27;s very likely that your solution will need to work with some data.
If you&#x27;re running on Azure (or other cloud providers) there are tools to help you keep your data secure both at rest and in transit. This is great document that can help you get a high level overview of Azure data security and encryption. And there are many more too…</span>

                    <span>Background


Ubuntu 21.10 can load on my computer through secure boot, and the shim version is 15.4. Then refer to the official tutorial, I installed rEFInd v0.13.2 (the latest version when I posted this blog) via PPA in Ubuntu 21.10. However, when I restart the system and load rEFInd, it always fails with the message Verification failed:(0x1A)Security Violation. I&#x27;m sure that both refind_local.cer and refind.cer under the EFI/refind/keys/ have been enrolled through MokManager (Although only refind_local.cer is needed through PPA installation).
From this post, I got that rEFInd currently (v0.13.2) lacks the .sbat section. For shim 15.3 and later versions, SBAT is mandatory, resulting in failure to start rEFInd.
The post also indicates that the author of rEFInd is currently studying how to …</span>

                    <span>Recently at work, I came across an interesting method to handle encryption at scale called envelope encryption. 
First of all, it increases security and helps you ease out the management of encryption keys. But it&#x27;s also a highly recommended pattern by PCI-DSS (Security Standard for Credit Card Processing) and results in much stronger data privacy and data protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). 
When we think of data there are 3 places we can think of encrypting data:
At Rest - On hardware storage devices like on a disk or in your devices 
In Transit - In moving data between different locations like server to server through API calls
In Use - While it&#x27;s being used by a server (New concept and still being researched)
We will be dealing primarily with encryption at rest and…</span>
