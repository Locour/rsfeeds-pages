Scully.io is a great tool for Angular developers. Its tagline is, “Scully makes building, testing and deploying JAMstack apps extremely simple.” Essentially, you build your application in Angular and then Scully will take it and generate static HTML and CSS for you. Those assets can be deployed, and the end result is a high quality, blazing fast experience.

Almost every new application starts out its life under very simple circumstances. The beginning means few users (mostly in the hundreds, rarely thousands), low traffic, few transactions, a small amount of data to process, and oftentimes limited clients ( at first most apps have just a web portal and no mobile or desktop clients at all). However, the number of users starts to grow, traffic spikes, transactions increase across the system, and user needs might prompt the requirement of mobile, d…</span>

I&#x27;m not a 100% familiar with NodeJS workers and clusters. I know that we can make use of multiple threads which is amazing to say the least.
I&#x27;m working on a small personal project that I&#x27;ve hosted on an free EC2 instance and I see that there is one CPU and one thread available. Is there then any benefit of using worker threads?
Also, why does the NodeJS Cluster documentation fork a cluster for a single CPU instead of a thread?

What Is Foreign Key?
⦁ A primary key in another (foreign) table.

                    <span>Webpack is a packaging tool whose purpose is to pack all static resources. Some people will ask why is webpack needed? Webpack is the cornerstone of modern front-end technology. Conventional development methods such as jQuery, HTML, and CSS static web page development have fallen behind. Now is the era of MVVM and data-driven interfaces. Webpack packs all kinds of new and useful technologies in modern JavaScript development.

This week, we go through the plugin implementation for Linux. Similar to Windows, we combine Dart and C++ code for Linux. The unexpected thing is the C++ data types of Flutter defined for Linux change a lot. So it still takes a little bit of time to make the plugin work.

I love a bit of architecture. How you structure your application is so important and if you get it wrong you&#x27;ll really pay for it down the line. The problem is you often don&#x27;t know you&#x27;ve got it wrong until it&#x27;s too late. I&#x27;ve made this mistake so many times and iterated on solutions so much that now when I start a project I know exactly how I want it to be structured. I&#x27;ve developed what I consider to be a pretty robust pattern for application development.

And as soon as the data is valid, we know that it is safe, because we define a set of rules to be followed, in order to have a standardization. This standardization can be from the type of data, up to the number of characters.
Data validation can be done on the client side and on the server side. From what I usually see on the internet, most people implement form validation just on the client side. But in this article I will talk about a library t…</span>

I&#x27;m not a 100% familiar with NodeJS workers and clusters. I know that we can make use of multiple threads which is amazing to say the least.
I&#x27;m working on a small personal project that I&#x27;ve hosted on an free EC2 instance and I see that there is one CPU and one thread available. Is there then any benefit of using worker threads?
Also, why does the NodeJS Cluster documentation fork a cluster for a single CPU instead of a thread?

                    <span>In this article, we are going to explore async/await which is the go-to tool for every javascript developer for async programming. If you&#x27;re fairly new to javascript, don&#x27;t worry, this article will help you understand async/await from the ground up.
async/await is a pattern in javascript which makes your code execute in a synchronous fashion but without compromising the async behaviour of javascript.

                    <span>TypeScript é um superconjunto (superset) que tem como um dos objetivos fazer o JavaScript ser tipado, desta forma facilitando o desenvolvimento, refatorações de código e correções de bugs.
Para utilizar o TypeScript é necessário instalá-lo usando npm:
npm install -g typescript

Depois de instalar, é necessário criar um arquivo com a extensão .ts
Exemplo: hello-world.ts
let languague &#x3D; &#x27;Javascript&#x27;
languague &#x3D; 9;

O código acima é ES6. Agora vamos precisar compilá-lo usando o compilador tsc:

                    <span>There is more to developing a component than making sure the component looks and works the way it should. Components are a huge portion of what our SPA is made up of so we should consider each component&#x27;s performance, usability, readability, and more. This will help make sure our code stays maintainable and performant over time.
For the user&#x27;s sake, we want the component to be as performant as it can be. The SPA&#x27;s job is to quickly render the data provided by the backend systems. Achieving this can be suppl…</span>
