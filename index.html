                    <span>Magic is just science that we do not understand yet
...Arthur C. Clarke
This article is part of what I call the magical directives series. In this series, we will unravel the mystery behind some interesting Angular directives. Afterwards, we can add this little magic to our tool box. I call them magical directives because they play a very important role in building reusable components across our Angular applications.
Below are the directives that we will be looking at in this series.
ng-template
ng-container
ng-content
*ngTemplateOutlet
The ng-template directive simply represent an Angular template. Angular uses the ng-template under the hood in our structural directives( *ngIf, *ngFor) and ngSwitch. The ngSwitch controls the structural directives (*ngSwitchCase and *ngSwitchDefault ) and ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Intro


We want to make our applications as safe as possible, so we implement a content security policy(CSP) to mitigate Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks or Click Jacking.
The demo application contains an ngx-bootstrap toggle and a Angular Material slider component.
application

Let&#x27;s implement a CSP header. More information about CSP.


The result is that our application doesn&#x27;t look the same anymore.
application

Due to our CSP policy, the browser blocks all inline styling that comes from an untrusted source.

Angular Material and ngx-bootstrap styles are added with the styleUrls property. Angular will parse the component&#x27;s styling and add them to the 
 of the page. Based on the ViewEncapsulation proper‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Understanding Kubernetes can be difficult or time-consuming. In order to spread knowledges about Cloud technologies I started to create sketchnotes about Kubernetes, then I&#x27;ve auto-published a book and since now I&#x27;ve started a new serie of video! :-)
I imagined a serie of short videos with a mix of sketchnotes and speech.
I think it could be a good way, more visual, with audio &amp; video to explain Kubernetes (and others technologies).
This episode is focused on Nodes and operations we can make on Nodes: Cordon, Drain, Taint...




The video is in French BUT I done the subtitles in english (and french too).
If you liked the video and are interested to watch another ones, please give me some feedbacks (and you can also subscribe to my Youtube channel, if you want to ‚ù§Ô∏è).
If you are interested, I published all the sketchnotes on Kubernetes (and new ones!) to make a &quot;book&quot; of 165 pages: &quot;Understanding Kubernetes in a visual way&quot;.
If you like theses sketchnotes, you can follow me, I will publish others sketchs shortly :-).</span>

                    <span>How to Use Every Core on your Machine using NodeJS 
Each job takes seconds to complete which is expensive in the long run. Now it takes less than a minute for 3000 jobs! This is the final result.

You have probably used other languages that have developer-friendly ways to multitask complex jobs. Unfortunately, doing this in JavaScript has always been complicated.
For the longest time, JavaScript and NodeJS were limited by the event loop. Code executes asynchronously, but not in true parallel fashion. However, that changed with the release of worker threads in NodeJS.
After discovering this concept, I immediately want to test its full capability. Unfortunately, the existing libraries are overly complex and/or lack true parallel capabilities.

                    <span>Arguably version control is among the biggest innovations in software engineering. 
Version control or revision control as it is called gives an immense power to the developers while developing the complex systems. Version control allows developers to keep the working pieces of the system available. Specifically version control allows critical capabilities such as reproducibility, traceability. 
Reproducibility is like a magical wand which helps to create identical systems no matter how complex the system itself is. 
Traceability helps developers to pick up any environment and track its dependencies. Traceability also helps to pick up any two versions of the environment and find out differences, if any. 
Advantages offered by reproducibility and traceability are already well understood by ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>What is &#x27;sudo&#x27; ?


Actually &#x27;sudo&#x27; command provides administrator privileges. When we create a new server it has a default &#x27;root&#x27; user. So, here I&#x27;m going to create a new user with sudo access.
Open your terminal and write the following command
root@localhost:~$ adduser [username] 



Set the password and confirm the password again.

Now you need to give &#x27;sudo&#x27; permission to the newly created user. So, use the usermod command in the terminal. Command is given bellow -
root@localhost:~$ usermod -aG [username] 

Now, the new user added to the sudo group. you can check by this command -
root@localhost:~$ su - [username] 

And run any command with &#x27;sudo&#x27; in the terminal -
 username@localhost:~$ sudo apt-get update 

If you want to add sudo to the existing user then just follow the step three.

                    <span>Scenario
You are using nginx and trying to call the downstream application but it returns http 502.
Cause
The reason could be because SELINUX would have blocked certain port. You can check the logs for more details.
Steps
The following example is from a sample repo whereby the downstream application uses port 801 and 802.
1) Check the ngnix logs‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää/var/log/ngnix/error.log
From here you will be able to see the error ‚Äúpermission denied‚Äù

2) Check the audit log‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää/var/log/audit/audit.log
Command:
sudo cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep nginx | grep denied


3) Check the ports that are allowed.
Command:
semange port -l | grep http


4) You can allow them for testing if it‚Äôs a legit request. 
Command:
semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 801</span>

                    <span>In my first post on this subject, I demonstrated how to develop a simple console app on windows and get it running on Linux with unit tests.  In this post I will expand on the previous post and show how Linux-specific and Windows-specific code can be developed and unit tested.  In addition I will take a look at xUnit test fixtures, Windows ACLs and Linux file permissions.
As in the last post, the approach is to develop code on Windows and test in Linux containers.  So on your windows dev box the set up you need is Hyper-V and Docker. 

Also needed are the dotnet CLI and VS Code for this optimum (in my view) setup.

If Apache DocumentRoot is not the default /var/www/html, it could be a NFS/EFS share. 


Then you might encounter ‚ÄúPermission denied for Apache HTTPD‚Äù error when accessing the site.



Solution:
Check your DocumentRoot setting to confirm it is not the default by running below command.




grep -i ‚ÄòDocumentRoot‚Äô /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

In output, you might see the DocumentRoot location as ‚Äú/data/docs/demo‚Äù (this is a NFS share)


By default NFS share access will be denied. This can be confirmed by running below command.




getsebool -a | grep httpd_use_nfs

It will give result ‚Äúhttpd_use_nfs ‚Üí off‚Äù


To enable it, run the command,




sudo setsebool -P httpd_use_nfs 1

You can see now &quot;httpd_use_nfs ‚Üí.on&quot;</span>

 conclusion: 
 
             

As an educational &amp; development and introductory computer, it&#x27;s hard to bet to Raspberry Pi. Every new release has managed to do more without fundamentally changing the size of the board, adding more powerful features day by day while still supporting the same interface for third party hardware, supporting a wide range of Operating Systems. As someone who grew up with 1980s 8-bit or 16-bit computers, there&#x27;s a certain nostalgia in a device like this, but this category of hardware clearly looks forward, building on its heritage and aiming to encourage more developer and engineers.</span>

As per official definition Node is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime. this is in contrast to thread based networking.
First let us make a basic understanding of thread and process&#x27;s. The basic instance of a computer program is called a process. within a single process we can have multiple things called threads , threads are kind of set of instructions that computer CPU needs to do.Scheduling is the ability of OS to decide which thread to process at anyinstance in time.

                    <span>Hello everyone, have you ever created a project that should be accessible to all and quickly ? Fortunately, thanks to the npm package system, you can download any package in one command line. Today in this tutorial I&#x27;m going to show you how to publish your package to npm, so that it&#x27;s available to everyone. 
The first thing you will need is to have Node.js installed on your machine. To do this, go to the official Node.js website, and download the latest version.
The second thing you will need is an npm account. If you don&#x27;t have one, you can create one for free on this page: https://www.npmjs.com/signup. This step is essential as you can only publish packages if you are logged in. Once you have created your account, and validated your email address (required), memorize your username and pa‚Ä¶</span>

Each job takes seconds to complete which is expensive in the long run. Now it takes less than a minute for 3000 jobs! This is the final result.

You have probably used other languages that have developer-friendly ways to multitask complex jobs. Unfortunately, doing this in JavaScript has always been complicated.
For the longest time, JavaScript and NodeJS were limited by the event loop. Code executes asynchronously, but not in true parallel fashion. However, that changed with the release of worker threads in NodeJS.
After discovering this concept, I immediately want to test its full capability. Unfortunately, the existing libraries are overly complex and/or lack true parallel capabilities.

  What is Node?


Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.
A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.
When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead‚Ä¶</span>

Usually, attacker will use a bot to try and crack our web app. One solution is to also include a honeypot everywhere there is a form. This will not deter all of the bot but adding that extra layer of security will not hurt right. Honestly, so far we made it so that we have incremental security measure in place. 
I think this is where I should say that, in security terms, there is nothing that is truly secure but we need to just slowdown the attack as much as we can to the point it doesn&#x27;t make any sense for the attacker to continue. 
pipenv install django-honeypot
pipenv lock -r &gt; requirements.txt

INSTALLED_APPS &#x3D; [
    #...

    # django-honeypot
    &#x27;honeypot&#x27;,
    #...
]

if you want to activate the honeypot web app wide, the easiest way was to use a middleware provided by django-honeypot
MIDDLEWARE &#x3D; [
    #...

    # Django-honeypot
    # https://pypi.org/project/django-honeypot/
    &#x27;honeypot.middleware.HoneypotMiddleware&#x27;,

    #...
]

lastly add this variable to your settings.py file
# Django-honeypot
# https://pypi.org/project/django-honeypot/
HONEYPOT_FIELD_NAME &#x3D; &quot;secret_key&quot;

As of right now I feel that we made our web app a bit safer. I&#x27;m not gonna say that our code is safe from any bot attack but at least the normal to medium type bot.</span>

                    <span>Intro


We want to make our applications as safe as possible, so we implement a content security policy(CSP) to mitigate Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks or Click Jacking.
The demo application contains an ngx-bootstrap toggle and a Angular Material slider component.
application

Let&#x27;s implement a CSP header. More information about CSP.


The result is that our application doesn&#x27;t look the same anymore.
application

Due to our CSP policy, the browser blocks all inline styling that comes from an untrusted source.
console.log

Angular Material and ngx-bootstrap styles are added with the styleUrls property. Angular will parse the component&#x27;s styling and add them to the 
 of the page. Based on the ViewEncapsulation proper‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Arguably version control is among the biggest innovations in software engineering. 
Version control or revision control as it is called gives an immense power to the developers while developing the complex systems. Version control allows developers to keep the working pieces of the system available. Specifically version control allows critical capabilities such as reproducibility, traceability. 
Reproducibility is like a magical wand which helps to create identical systems no matter how complex the system itself is. 
Traceability helps developers to pick up any environment and track its dependencies. Traceability also helps to pick up any two versions of the environment and find out differences, if any. 
Advantages offered by reproducibility and traceability are already well understood by ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>TL;DR


Use COPY src src.
Refer to the Sysdig&#x27;s post.
COPY . . will place credentials in container by default. You will need to configure .dockerignore to avoid this. However, managing .dockerignore is tedious and easy to make mistake. This is just like .gitignore.
Whitelist copying like COPY src src and copy build build never cause this problem.
The files required by a command are different by step. For example, npm install requires only package.json and package-lock.json. Overwriting them in a later step by COPY . . may cause a consistency problem. In addition, not the builder container but only the runner container requires the files under src in Node.js, Ruby, Python, and so on with builder pattern. 
I suggest to use whitelist copying to avoid some security problems. Build time will become shorter as a bonus.</span>

                    <span>When talking about Web Application security, I think one of the main page we need to defend at all cost is the webpage admin page. Once a hacker is able to gain access to the admin page, the fear would be the hacker is able to exfiltrate all our user Personal Information (PI). 
There are many propose solution to keep the web app admin pages safe. The propose solutions are:
But you know what, no matter how you handle securing the web app admin site. There will always be someone who will try to gain access to your website. Why not have a little fun and set up a honeypot for them. What a honeypot you may ask? A simple way of explaining it in layman terms is that its a lure for our hacker to try and attack us.
One package we can use as a honeypot is called django-admin-honeypot. Its a simple package that will replace the real admin page with a face one and register all IP that try to access the page.
Installing django-admin-honeypot is just a simple as :
pipenv install django-admin-honeypot
pipenv lock -r &gt; requirements.txt

add admin_honeypot in INSTALLED_APP located in settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS &#x3D; [
    #...

    # Django-admin-honeypot
    &#x27;admin_honeypot&#x27;,
    #...
]

urlpatterns &#x3D; [
    path(&#x27;admin/&#x27;, include(&#x27;admin_honeypot.urls&#x27;, namespace&#x3D;&#x27;admin_honeypot&#x27;)),
    path(&#x27;secret/&#x27;, admin.site.urls),
    #       ^-- Change this to anything you like eg:secret
    #...
]

With just 3 simple steps we are able to better protect our webapp. But this is not a fool proof method of protecting our app... It is one of the step to better secure our webapp.</span>

This document is to evaluate and provide guidance on the benefits/feature of Amazon S3‚Äôs SRR and CRR replication strategy.


Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets. Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts.


Replication can be achieved within the same AWS Region or different AWS Region.



Use Cases

Same-Region Replication (SRR)
Automatically replicates data between buckets within the same AWS Region.
Replication can be setup at a bucket level, a shared prefix level, or an object level using S3 object tags.
SRR can be use to make a second copy of data in the same AWS Region.

...Arthur C. Clarke
This article is part of what I call the magical directives series. In this series, we will unravel the mystery behind some interesting Angular directives. Afterwards, we can add this little magic to our tool box. I call them magical directives because they play a very important role in building reusable components across our Angular applications.
Below are the directives that we will be looking at in this series.
ng-template
ng-container
ng-content
*ngTemplateOutlet
The ng-template directive simply represent an Angular template. Angular uses the ng-template under the hood in our structural directives( *ngIf, *ngFor) and ngSwitch. The ngSwitch controls the structural directives (*ngSwitchCase and *ngSwitchDefault ) and ‚Ä¶</span>

Previously, I had used AWS SAM to build a CRUD app for notes. Recently, I wanted to learn more about the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), GraphQL, and AWS AppSync, so I decided to refactor my original project.
Disclaimer that at the time of writing the CDK v2 is in developer preview. This blog post will use CDK v1.
If you want to skip ahead, take a look the finished project here.
If this is your first time using the CDK, bootstrap your AWS account. The Prerequisites section in this guide has the steps.
Start by installing the CDK npm package and running the cdk init command. This is helpful because it gives you a directory structure along with a very minimal stack to get started.

  The following is a blog on core types in typescript that are not there in JavaScript for beautiful devs. You should have  a proper knowledge of &#x27;vanilla&#x27; JavaScript.



  
  
  The following are the steps to setup the dev environment {


‚Ä¢ install node 
to compile the file and automatically you should have a JavaScript file created 
‚Ä¢ enables you to add multiple values in one variable


‚Ä¢ allows you to add multiple core types


 ‚Ä¢ enum helps you delaring set of named constants


}


  
  
  Nice!



  
  
  Now you know all the core types!

Accordions in general are vertically stacked lists of headers when clicked reveals some content. Accordions or expandable sections are seen as part of almost all the UI libraries out there.
If we take a look at Angular material, we have Expansion Panel (ref) and in Ng Bootstrap its called simple Accordion (ref).
What we are gonna build is a much simpler version of these. And as always, the whole idea behind this is to help you explore some possibilities of Angular. This blog post would be mostly about how we can use Content Projection (ref) in Angular to create reusable and customizable UI ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>An immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) is often used to group related functionality into a single object or module. 
Ex:




let isCuteMixin &#x3D; function(obj) {
  obj.isCute &#x3D; function() {
    return true;
  };
};
let singMixin &#x3D; function(obj) {
  obj.sing &#x3D; function() {
    console.log(&quot;Singing to an awesome tune&quot;);
  };
};

We can group these mixins into a module as follows:




let funModule &#x3D; (function() {
  return {
    isCuteMixin: function(obj) {
      obj.isCute &#x3D; function() {
        return true;
      };
    },
    singMixin: function(obj) {
      obj.sing &#x3D; function() {
        console.log(&quot;Singing to an awesome tune&quot;);
      };
    }
  };
})();

Note that you have an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that returns an object funModule. This returned object contains all of the mixin behaviors as properties of the object. The advantage of the module pattern is that all of the motion behaviors can be packaged into a single object that can then be used by other parts of your code.</span>

                    <span>A common pattern in JavaScript is to execute a function as soon as it is declared:




(function () {
  console.log(&quot;Chirp, chirp!&quot;);
})();

This is an anonymous function expression that executes right away, and outputs Chirp, chirp! immediately.
Note that the function has no name and is not stored in a variable. The two parentheses () at the end of the function expression cause it to be immediately executed or invoked. This pattern is known as an immediately invoked function expression or IIFE.


Let&#x27;s rewrite the function makeNest and remove its call so instead it&#x27;s an anonymous immediately invoked function expression (IIFE).




function makeNest() {
  console.log(&quot;A cozy nest is ready&quot;);
}

makeNest();

Answer:




(function () {
  console.log(&quot;A cozy nest is ready&quot;);
})();</span>

                    <span>In the previous post, bird had a public property name. It is considered public because it can be accessed and changed outside of bird&#x27;s definition.




bird.name &#x3D; &quot;Duffy&quot;;

Therefore, any part of your code can easily change the name of bird to any value. Think about things like passwords and bank accounts being easily changeable by any part of your codebase. That could cause a lot of issues.


The simplest way to make this public property private is by creating a variable within the constructor function. This changes the scope of that variable to be within the constructor function versus available globally. This way, the variable can only be accessed and changed by methods also within the constructor function.




function Bird() {
  let weight &#x3D; 15;

  this.getWeight &#x3D; function() {
    return weight;
  }
}
let ducky &#x3D; new Bird();
console.log(ducky.getWeight()); // will display 15

Here getWeight is a privileged method, because it has access to the private variable weight. This is possible because weight is declared in the same context as getWeight. In JavaScript, a function always has access to the context in which it was created. This is called closure.</span>

                    <span>As you have seen, behavior is shared through inheritance. However, there are cases when inheritance is not the best solution. Inheritance does not work well for unrelated objects like Bird and Airplane. They can both fly, but a Bird is not a type of Airplane and vice versa.
For unrelated objects, it&#x27;s better to use mixins. A mixin allows other objects to use a collection of functions.




let flyMixin &#x3D; function(obj) {
  obj.fly &#x3D; function() {
    console.log(&quot;Flying, wooosh!&quot;);
  }
};

The flyMixin takes any object and gives it the fly method.




let bird &#x3D; {
  name: &quot;Donald&quot;,
  numLegs: 2
};

let plane &#x3D; {
  model: &quot;777&quot;,
  numPassengers: 524
};

flyMixin(bird);
flyMixin(plane);

Here bird and plane are passed into flyMixin, which then assigns the fly function to each object. Now bird and plane can both fly:




bird.fly();
plane.fly();

The console would display the string Flying, wooosh! twice, once for each .fly() call.</span>

                    <span>In previous posts, you learned that an object can inherit its behavior (methods) from another object by referencing its prototype object:




ChildObject.prototype &#x3D; Object.create(ParentObject.prototype);

Then the ChildObject received its own methods by chaining them onto its prototype:




ChildObject.prototype.methodName &#x3D; function() {...};

It&#x27;s possible to override an inherited method. It&#x27;s done the same way - by adding a method to ChildObject.prototype using the same method name as the one to override. Here&#x27;s an example of Dog overriding the eat() method inherited from Animal:




function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat &#x3D; function() {
  return &quot;nom nom nom&quot;;
};

function Dog() { }
Dog.prototype &#x3D; Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.eat &#x3D; function() {
  return &quot;chew chew chew&quot;;
};

If you have an instance let beagle &#x3D; new Dog(); and you call beagle.eat(), this is how JavaScript looks for the method on beagle‚Äôs prototype chain:
beagle &#x3D;&gt; Is eat() defined here? No.


Dog &#x3D;&gt; Is eat() defined here? &#x3D;&gt; Yes. Execute it and stop searching.


Animal &#x3D;&gt; eat() is also defined, but JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.


Object &#x3D;&gt; JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.</span>

So far, Fusuma has only allowed you to set one type of action for a gesture globally.
In this article, we will install fusuma-plugin-appmatcher and configure application-specific settings on Fusuma&#x27;s config.yml.
Run the following command in a terminal
$ sudo gem install fusuma-plugin-appmatcher

To get application name (WM_CLASS) to specify in config.yml, use $ fusuma-appmatcher -l.
-l option, only foreground application names are retrieved.
$ fusuma-appmatcher -l

                    <span>Node.js is a very popular open source javascript runtime environment which is used to develop network applications. Node JS has gained massive popularity and now is used by thousands of developers all over the world for server-side programming.
Node.js is a platform built on Chrome‚Äôs JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses event-driven, non-blocking I/O for file system access, networking, and other API calls, allowing it to support thousands of concurrent connections with near-zero programming latency.
You can make really cool real-time web applications using Node Js. There are a whole bunch of libraries and modules available to help you achieve this.   
Node JS is a fast growing platform for running JS based applications outside of the browser. 
Node JS has rocked the world of web application and making some big waves in the tech market. It‚Äôs been around for quite some time back in 2009 but is now widely used. (Initial release    May 27, 2009)

When I call another software from Node.js, I use &quot;child_process&quot; like this.

&quot;child_process&quot; has four kind of methods(exclude &quot;Sync&quot; mehtods).
exec
execFile
fork
spawn
Because I wanted to know how to use them properly, I will try them.
Node.js ver.16.3.0
ts-node ver.10.0.0
TypeScript ver.4.3.2
According to the documents, they are based on &quot;child_process.spawn()&quot;.
import { exec, execFile, fork, spawn } from &quot;child_process&quot;;
import path, { resolve } from &quot;path/posix&quot;;

function start() {
    spawnSample(&#x27;powershell&#x27;,[&#x27;node&#x27;, &#x27;-v&#x27;]);
}
function spawnSample(command: string, args: string[]) {

                    <span>Define npm scripts in your package.json:
&quot;start&quot;: &quot;ember serve&quot;,
&quot;test&quot;: &quot;ember exam --load-balance --parallel&#x3D;4&quot;,
&quot;lint&quot;: &quot;npm-run-all --parallel --aggregate-output lint:**&quot;,

and use those scripts, don&#x27;t use global commands.
Bad: ember test (yes, it&#x27;s bad even if you see it in the official docs)
Good: npm test
There are several benefits to using npm scripts instead of global commands:
No chance of local vs global package version mismatch that can lead to inexplicable errors
No chance of using the wrong command and/or options (for example, the default command for running tests in Ember projects is ember test, but a project might use ember exam and/or additional options like --load-balance --parallel&#x3D;4)
No need to remember specific commands for each type of project, because npm start and npm test are standard commands used by virtually every JavaScript project, be it an Ember project, a React project, or an Express project
No need to install global packages, keep track of their versions, and update them
If you really need to run a one-off command, use npx, it will protect you from local vs global package version mismatch (because it uses local package if it detects one):

                    <span>JavaScript has three ways to declare variables.





var width &#x3D; 100;
let height &#x3D; 200;
const key &#x3D; &quot;Tech Talks&quot;;

The scope of a variable defined with the keyword ‚Äúvar‚Äù is limited to the ‚Äúfunction‚Äù within which it is defined.
If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global.
var is function scoped



Block Example
{
 var a &#x3D; 10;
 console.log(a);
} //block 1
{
 a++;
 console.log(a);
} //block 2

We are using the keyword var to define the variable a, the scope of a is limited to the function within which it is defined.
Since a is not defined within any function, the scope of the variable a is global, which means that a is recognized within block 2
Function Example
function fun1() {
 var a &#x3D; 10;
 console.log(a);
} //function scope of fun1

function fun2() {
 a++;

                    <span>Ol√°, hoje quero falar sobre as opera√ß√µes de CRUD do AdonisJS.
AdonisJS √© um framework MVC completo para o NodeJS.
Para programadores PHP o AdonisJS √© comparado ao Laravel, a sua sintaxe √© quase semelhante, sem falar que os dois usam Template Engine.
O AdonisJS √© um framework NodeJS e para isso precisamos do NodeJS instalado no nosso computador. Para ser mais especifico, precisamos do NodeJS na vers√£o igual ou superior a 14.15.4 e precisamos tamb√©m do NPM instalado na vers√£o igual ou superior a 6.0.0.
Voc√™ pode criar um novo projecto utilizando o npm init ou yarn create. Os dois comandos v√£o instalar os pacotes do AdonisJS no seu computador.
Nesse caso vamos usar o NPM.
Vamos abrir o terminal e escrever:
npm init adonis-ts-app@latest crud-operations
Depois de executar o comando no terminal voc√™ pode escolher entre 3 op√ß√µes a sua estrutura de projecto.
web: estrutura de projecto ideal para a cria√ß√£o de aplica√ß√µes cl√°ssicos renderizados para servidores. Nessa selec√ß√£o vai ser configurado suporte para sess√µes e tamb√©m o template engine do AdonisJS


api: estrutura de projecto ideal para cria√ß√£o de um servidor API


slim: estrutura de projecto ideal para criar a menor aplica√ß√£o AdonisJS poss√≠vel e n√£o instala nenhum pacote adicional, expecto o n√∫cleo do framework.



Para o nosso projecto vamos selecionar a estrutura API.

                    <span>What Is SSH?


SSH or Secure Shell allows people to have remote access to their servers. It uses cryptographic techniques to make sure all communication to and from the server happens in an encrypted way.
It gives you a method of authenticating remote users, transferring inputs from the client to the host and relay information back to the client.
Linux and macOS users can use the terminal to SSH into their remote server directly. Windows users have to use something like Putty.
You&#x27;re able to use shell commands in the same way you would if you were physically using the remote computer.
The SSH command has three pieces;
ssh {user}@{host}

SSH tells the system that you want to open an encrypted connection.


User is for the account you want to access (root &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; admin for example).

                    <span>Introduction üìÑ


It&#x27;s a common mistake that every developer tends to make, especially early on: adding secrets to source-control or saving them somewhere else in plain-text. A good example of this is an API key stored in the web.config or settings.json.
Saving secrets as plain-text is a bad-practice can be a security risk. But where should you save your secrets? And how much does it cost to implement an alternative solution?
Azure Key Vault (AKV) is a service provided by Microsoft Azure that lets you store encryption keys, secrets and certificates. AKV can be easily integrated with almost any other service in Azure, but it doesn&#x27;t stop there. It can easily be integrated in other environments too: local machines, apps, if you want to go crazy you can even use it in an AWS environment.

Let&#x27;s admit it typing effect looks cool and the good news is we can achieve it without any pain üòú.
    npm install typed.js
    or
    yarn add typed.js
    or
    bower install typed.js

Let&#x27;s dive into the code.





import Typed from &quot;typed.js&quot;;
import { useEffect, useRef } from &quot;react&quot;;

export default function App() {
  // Create Ref element.
  const el &#x3D; useRef(null);

  useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
    const typed &#x3D; new Typed(el.current, {
      strings: [&quot;Handy&quot;, &quot;Mandy&quot;, &quot;Candy&quot;, &quot;More Strings&quot;], // Strings to display
      // Speed settings, try diffrent values untill you get good results
      startDelay: 300,
      typeSpeed: 100,
      backSpeed: 100,
      backDelay: 100
    });

    // Destropying
    return () &#x3D;&gt; {
      typed.destroy();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    
Hello Developers

    
 {
    const typed &#x3D; new Typed(el.current, {
      strings: [&quot;Handy&quot;, &quot;Mandy&quot;, &quot;Candy&quot;, &quot;More Strings&quot;], // Strings to display

      startDelay: 300,
      typeSpeed: 100,
      backSpeed: 100,
      backDelay: 100,
      smartBackspace: true,
      loop: true,
      showCursor: true,
      cursorChar: &quot;!&quot;
    });

    // Destropying
    return () &#x3D;&gt; {
      typed.destroy();
    };
  }, []);
    ...


For TypeScript lovers it provide types by default.

When I call another software from Node.js, I use &quot;child_process&quot; like this.

&quot;child_process&quot; has four kind of methods(exclude &quot;Sync&quot; mehtods).

execFile
fork
spawn
Because I wanted to know how to use them properly, I will try them.
Node.js ver.16.3.0

TypeScript ver.4.3.2
According to the documents, they are based on &quot;child_process.spawn()&quot;.
import { exec, execFile, fork, spawn } from &quot;child_process&quot;;
import path, { resolve } from &quot;path/posix&quot;;

function start() {

                    <span>How to create a super simple accordion component in Angular. Using the power of content projection in Angular, we are going to build an accordion/expansion panel that can be customized in multiple ways.
Accordions in general are vertically stacked lists of headers when clicked reveals some content. Accordions or expandable sections are seen as part of almost all the UI libraries out there.
If we take a look at Angular material, we have Expansion Panel (ref) and in Ng Bootstrap its called simple Accordion (ref).
What we are gonna build is a much simpler version of these. And as always, the whole idea behind this is to help you explore some possibilities of Angular. This blog post would be mostly about how we can use Content Projection (ref) in Angular to create reusable and customizable UI ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Hello there,
When I posted it, nueva can only render simple elements like div, p, h1 and others.
But now we can render it as a component. So that we can make it much cleaner and easy to build complex UI&#x27;s. Check the repo for an example
It is currently on v-0.0.9-full. We can add reactive values and all to the Element.
Check out the project:-
https://github.com/codingwith3dv/nueva
https://npmjs.org/package/nueva
Before you go please try contribute to the project and help it grow.
Thanks for reading till here

                    <span>In this post, you will learn how different ways declaring a ref with useRef hook influence the immutability of the current ref property. We will be looking at how to make the current property immutable, mutable, and know without much effort if the ref is one or the other.
All the behavior I&#x27;m going to talk about is only relevant in the context of TypeScript. The mutability / immutability is enforced at type level, not runtime level.
current property


The immutable semantics of the useRef hooks are usually used with DOM elements. A common use-case might be to get the ref of an element and focus that element whenever a button is clicked.
Here is how I would write that.
import * as React from &quot;react&quot;;

const Component &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
  const inputRef &#x3D; React.useRef(null);

                    <span>I&#x27;ve reached a point where I&#x27;m now really enjoying working with Typescript. I remember one of the senior engineers in my team telling me when I first started that I would find myself being a Typescript convert one day. I didn&#x27;t really believe it then, as TS seemed to be so much more of a hindrance than help in the early days (it wouldn&#x27;t even allow me to run my code to debug it!)...but I&#x27;m happy to say he was right. ‚úåüèª
I&#x27;ve reached the tipping point, where it now feels weird to NOT have Typescript switched on for a Javascript repo. There are, for sure, still days when I&#x27;m trying to get a specific scenario typed properly and I&#x27;m finding it difficult to even know what to Google for... but it gets easier over time as you start to build a bank of knowledge and realise that the same patterns k‚Ä¶</span>

I recently published an article about the compatibility opt-in preview version of Ivy in version 8 and what I experienced attempting to upgrade. This is a follow-on to show what the current upgrade path looks like using Angular v9.0.0-next.6 pre-beta, which contains optimizations for bundle size and performance as well as some bug fixes that were not present in v8‚Äôs preview.
As a reminder, Ivy is not ready for production. This is still a compatibility opt-in preview. Use at your own risk. Your mileage may vary.
I‚Äôll be upgrading a large commercial application that leverages many third-party dependencies and a wide gamut of the Angular framework.

Existen varias soluciones para automatizar la ejecuci√≥n de pruebas y una de ellas es GitHub Actions. A continuaci√≥n explicar√© como configurarlo en un proyecto de Angular.
Primero crearemos un proyecto Angular en blanco. Es necesario instalar la ultima versi√≥n de Angular CLI, la cual podemos instalar o actualizar con el siguiente comando.
npm i @angular/cli -g # Instalaci√≥n global

Ahora podemos crear nuestro proyecto con el siguiente comando
ng new ghactions-angular # Cambia ghactions... por el nombre de tu proyecto

                    <span>I started learning React 1 year ago. There was only one thing in my mind How Awesome is React.
Gradually I started thinking about my own website and came over an idea to launch a website, where I can share some technical stuff among people.
I started thinking and thinkingü§î about its architecture (Obviously I am not an architectü§™).
I got some options like ReactJS (Or NextJS), Angular, VueJS or Plain HTML-CSS-JS. Now it was totally on me, which one should I choose, obviously it was going to affect my audience and performance of website too.
I was also aware about the SEO part,ü•∞ obviously how could I forgot that, because that was the entrypoint of my orgaic readers.
Finally I had these options:
Angular
React (Or NextJS)
VueJS (Or NuxtJS)
Now I compared all of these and found something in Angular and React, which does not fits to my requirements.
Angular Too Hacticü§Ø
React Server Side Rendering was complex to achieve for a production grade application.üò©
NextJS Server Side Rendering was supported, but deployment on personal server was removing some important features.üò°
Now the last one
VueJS  I explored VueJS and found that there is a awesome framework on the top of Vue, NuxtJS. I explored it more and more and found these keypoints:
Server Side Rendering Support
Built on Top of VueJS
Lightweight
Can be deployed to own servers, without any performance loss
Open Source
Lot of Options For handling SEO
At this point, I had no doubts &amp; no questions. I had decided that I will go with NuxtJS and create this awesome site.
Now its been 1 month passed, everything is running fine and smoothly with NuxtJS.
Hashcodec.com now. We are planning to launch it on 01st June 2021.
Thanks For Reading This Guys.üòá
Don&#x27;t forgot to visit our website Hashcodec.com

Suggestions are welcome and appreciated.</span>

                    <span>Session Manager Overview
Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that lets you manage your Amazon EC2 instances through an interactive one-click browser-based shell or through the AWS CLI.


Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.


Session Manager also makes it easy to comply with corporate policies that require controlled access to instances, strict security practices, and fully auditable logs with instance access details, while still providing end users with simple one-click cross-platform access to your Amazon EC2 instances.

                    <span>Working with arrays in a functional way has mostly become the default when working with JavaScript these days. Why should you use a traditional imperative loop, like for, for..of, while, do..while, etc., when you can use map, filter, and forEach?
These functional methods have one caveat, though: You can never throw from them without aborting the whole pipeline.
someArray.map((value) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (someConditionMet) {
    throw new Error(&#x27;...&#x27;); // this is not the best idea...
  }
  // ...
  return someValidValue;
});

So what do you do then? Well, you can return null to mark that you have an invalid result.
someArray.map((value) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (someConditionMet) {
    return null; // now the pipeline can continue
  }
  // ...
  return someValidValue;
});

That&#x27;s fine. If you don&#x27;t want your pipelin‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>As awesome as flexbox is, what it‚Äôs doing under the hood is actually a little strange because, by default, it is doing two things at once. It first looks at the content size which is what we would get if by declaring width: max-content on an element. But on top of that, flex-shrink is also doing some work allowing the items to be smaller, but only if needed.
Let‚Äôs break those two down and see how they work together.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>
