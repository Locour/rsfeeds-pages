Everything about this article was well done and very interesting.
There was one point in the article that spiked my interest: the author triggered the &quot;creation&quot; of the Form Controls dynamically within the Angular HTML.
So, I decided to experiment and see if I could use this as a means to trigger data validation and transformation.
This is an experiment, simple to see if I can do something. Personally, I see some benefit in the pattern. But, this does not mean I am endorsing this as a good pattern or a better means than any other way of doing something.

In this article, we&#x27;ll look at how to handle the login process with Session Authentication. We&#x27;ll verify if the user is logged in or not, and if he is not, then the route will simply be blocked.
Let’s go through the following Angular principles for better understanding.
Angular Routing module
Manage the user authentication permission for the Angular path.
Angular Auth Guard
This Angular function helps a lot when it comes to handling authentication. This is an interface that instructs the router whether or not to enable navigation to a specific route. We&#x27;re using the &#x27;canActivate&#x27; guard form in this case.
Angular localStorage
In an Angular program, there are three ways to store data on the client-side.

Session storage

                    <span>Flaky tests are non-deterministic tests in your test suite. They may be intermittently passing or failing, making test results unreliable.
Why are flaky tests bad?
Developer productivity goes down as test results become inaccurate and trust in the test-suite decreases.
Multiple, unrelated commits cause similar errors, making maintenance difficult.
Legitimate issues may get ignored due to a high number of false positives.
Repetitive work is required to determine if bugs exist at all.
Diagnostics time increases as errors can be in the test or code.
User dissatisfaction due to bugs ending up in production.
Let&#x27;s look at five common causes for flaky tests showing up in your build pipeline and what you can do about them.

Navigate to the Lens website (https://k8slens.dev/) and download the latest version of Lens for your preferred OS. Once you have downloaded and installed, open the application, Lens IDE will automatically add your Kubeconfig (if done correctly, you will see a cluster icon on the left-hand-side). Lens works with any certified CNCF Kubernetes distro. 
Now that your cluster has been added, you have full situational awareness of your Kubernetes cluster. Users can easily monitor all objects and resources within their cluster.  
In order to share a cluster with a team or team member, you will first need to create a Lens Spaces account:

                    <span>One of the most time-consuming tasks in my GitHub workflows is the solving, download and installation of Anaconda environments.
Some of my pipelines runs on Linux and Mac, so I usually need to set up matrix to handle the different installation paths of Miniconda.
jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        include:
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            label: Linux
            prefix: /usr/share/miniconda3/envs/carsus

          - os: macos-latest
            label: macOS
            prefix: /Users/runner/miniconda3/envs/carsus

At the step level, install Miniconda without specifying a YAML environment file.
I choose the Mambaforge variant, which is basically a custom Miniconda build shipped with the lightning-fast mamba package manager and the conda-forge channel enabled.
- name: Setup Miniconda
  uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2
  with:
      miniforge-variant: Mambaforge
      miniforge-version: latest
      activate-environment: 
      use-mamba: true

The cache task work with keys. When the task is executed, looks for a saved cache that matches the key and retrieves the data.
Cache is specific for every OS. Also, I set up the key in a way that will update the cache every 24 hours or if the environment has changed.
- name: Set cache number
  run: echo &quot;::set-output name&#x3D;number::$(date +&#x27;%d%m&#x27;)&quot;
  id: cache-number

- uses: actions/cache@v2
  with:
    path: /usr/share/miniconda3/envs/carsus
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-conda-${{ hashFiles(&#x27;&#x27;) }}-${{ env.CACHE_NUMBER }}
  env:
    CACHE_NUMBER: ${{ steps.cache-number.outputs.number }}
  id: conda-cache

Finally, if the cache is not available, update the environment according to the YAML environment file.
- name: Update environment
  run: mamba env update -n  -f 
  if: steps.conda-cache.outputs.cache-hit !&#x3D; &#x27;true&#x27;</span>

In this quick tutorial, you will learn how to add a default value to an existing column in MySQL.
You always need to be careful, when changing the structure of an existing column in your database. Make sure to always have backups of your database before making such changes. 
For MySQL, you could use the following script to generate a backup of your database:
Script to backup a MySQL/MariaDB database
When making changes to a column in your database, you can use the ALTER TABLE statement followed by the ALTER COLUMN statement.
The syntax is the following:
ALTER TABLE name_of_the_table ALTER name_of_the_column SET DEFAULT your_new_default_value;

Let&#x27;s say that we had a table called users and a column called is_admin. We want all new users to have the is_admin value set to 0. T…</span>

                    <span>Terraform State é uma das coisas mais legais da ferramenta por facilitar a gestão do codígo com times distribuídos evitando conflitos desnecessários na esteira. 
Sempre que você executa o Terraform, ele registra informações sobre a infraestrutura que criou em um arquivo de estado do Terraform. Por padrão, quando você executa o Terraform na pasta /foo/bar, o Terraform cria o arquivo /foo/bar/terraform.tfstate. Este arquivo contém um formato JSON personalizado que registra um mapeamento dos recursos do Terraform em seus arquivos de configuração para a representação desses recursos no mundo real. Por exemplo, digamos que sua configuração do Terraform contenha o seguinte:
resource &quot;aws_instance&quot; &quot;example&quot; {

Monitoring of production environment is an essential part of any products not depending on the size. But monitoring big production environments efficiently is the essential difference between good quality of service and bad service.
Brief prehistory — our product is delivered to a few different clients. It means we have a multi-tenant environment and each of them requires proper monitoring. Every tenant has its own production subscription and independent infrastructure.
At the start all our monitoring was organized on native Azure Cloud resources, meaning all data go into Application Insight (Log analytics) and dashboards were built in the same environment.

Use the following script to receive Telegram notifications always your Github Actions is running.
    - name: Send Telegram Message Ok
        uses: appleboy/telegram-action@master
        env:
          GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJSON(github) }}
        with:
          to: ${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_ID }}
          token: ${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_TOKEN }}
          format: markdown
          message: |
            *1st line of your message with bold*
            *2nd line of your message with bold, too*
            Application: *Write something to be put inside your message*. The below lines still are part of your message.          
            Branch: *${{ github.ref }}*
            Repository: *${{ github.repository }}*
            Owner: *${{ github.repository_owner }}*

If you want to go deeper into this component, go to project&#x27;s github repository
As we can see, to use this component we need two important informations, the TELEGRAM_ID and the TELEGRAM_TOKEN.
To get your TELEGRAM_TOKEN, you will need to create a telegram&#x27;s bot, do that starting a conversation with BotFather. Start a new conversation and search for @botfather.

You can start the conversation sending a /help message to see all options allowed. But if you want to skip this step, just send /newbot and follow the instructions. When finish bot&#x27;s creation, you will receive a message with your bot&#x27;s token, as show below:

Good job! Now you got your TELEGRAM_TOKEN, in this example it is 2063069520:AAE7Gcummn9fSp_xLQH7dBGihpzOyWQCm9g.
Now, let&#x27;s find out your TELEGRAM_ID. Just search for @userinfobot and start a conversation with /star message. The result message will be like that:
@your_telegram_username
Id: 12345678
First: 
Last: 
Lang: en-US

Your TELEGRAM_ID is the number in second line, right between your username and firstname.
In this point you have all information to start sending notification messages at any pipeline in Github Actions.
Just add these information to repository secrets.</span>

No matter if you are a data analyst or a system administrator when working with unstructured files in Linux there are a set of commands that would help you a lot in your daily tasks.
In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of the following commands and how to combine them using a pipe (|) and analyze some raw data files.
The list of the commands that we will go over are:
cat
head and tail
pipe (|)
wc
grep
awk
sort
uniq
sed
tr
Here is a very simple example file that I will be using to go over each of the commands:

                    <span>Hello👋, Its Rohan Kadam😊
Today cloud is becoming come standard for the development of any software. We used the cloud in every aspect of the programming cycle be it uploading our code to Github or Gitlab or be it using Google Drive or Dropbox or uploading our personal files. In the article, we are going to understand how we can implement file** upload to Azure Blob Using Spring Boot**.

Blob storage is a feature in Microsoft Azure that lets developers store unstructured data in Microsoft’s cloud platform. This data can be accessed from anywhere in the world and can include audio, video and text. Blobs are grouped into “containers” that are tied to user accounts. Blobs can be manipulated by using any programming language. Blobs are widely used by streaming companies with high volumes of a…</span>

                    <span>The idea of monitoring systems and applications has been around for years. Ensuring that a system and application are performing the way they&#x27;re supposed to isn&#x27;t anything new. It&#x27;s simply a component that&#x27;s been changing drastically, specifically with application performance and load using a practice called Application Performance Monitoring (APM).
So why is APM important now and why should you care? In this blog post, you&#x27;re going to learn about APM, why it&#x27;s important, and how to get started.
In the early days of software, tools started to come out for understanding how much load a system running an application could take. A notable tool is Apache JMeter, which is a load testing tool for analyzing and measuring performance. The first release of JMeter was in 1998, which means the idea o…</span>

                    <span>Hey everyone! I am back with another Linux article!😊
Today I will be going over basic commands you can use to monitor system performance! 📈📉💻
The &#x27;top&#x27; command is used to display active processes and how much they are using system resources.

lsof stands for list of open files- basically shows you list of files and the processes

&#x27;tcpdump&#x27; is used to analyze network traffic
&#x27;htop&#x27; is a lot like top - It&#x27;s just allows you to monitor system resources or processes. As you can see, it&#x27;s a bit more fancy than top

&#x27;iostat&#x27; is a command that is used to monitor input/output devices, by telling you how long the devices have been active.

Displays the processes

Tells you how long the system has been up

&#x27;free&#x27; shows you the amount of available memory you have.

Used to monitor individual tasks. Great for troubleshooting issues.

&#x27;w&#x27; tells you information about users logged on and their processes

These commands can be vital for you to monitor your system, so I will be releasing a part 2 soon, as well!😆
For future Linux and security content, please give me a follow

                    <span>Have you ever encountered ERROR: One or more PGP signatures could not be verified! this error during the installation of Dropbox in Arch based distro ? If yes then this guide is for you. 
Dropbox has their own PGP key because they upload it directly to the AUR that key is for linux@dropbox.com (if you don&#x27;t know what PGP keys are it&#x27;s basically a complex math formula that proves that this app is being uploaded and managed on the AUR by somebody at dropbox)
if you use a tool like yay or paru it can handle the functions of pacman and downloading stuff from the AUR and it&#x27;s dead simple to use, I recommend paru because it&#x27;s more modern and faster
To install paru run these commands
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git

cd paru

makepkg -si

After succesfully installing paru now it&#x27;s time to install Dropbox. To do that first run
paru dropbox

Now you&#x27;ll be prompt with a list of packages from AUR to choose from. You have to choose aur/dropbox which should be the first one... So press 1 and hit enter

If you want to review hit Y and enter

To close the review hit q on the the keyboard
Now you must prompt with installation confirmation. Hit Y and enter. You may need to enter your password for installation. 
After completion of you installation run dropbox on your terminal or search on the GUI

That&#x27;s it!</span>

                    <span>Normally, when we are configuring legacy applications is difficult to find accurate documentation about the used tools (Dependencies, Libraries, Environment).
Currently, Symfony&#x27;s version is 5.3.10 thus actual documentation points out towards these newer versions from the framework even though previous documentation is still accessible since version 2.7

Avoid looking for hundred sites and freaking out whether any solutions work or work partially, in this post we are going a step to step to configure a Symfony 2.7 app in Apache 2.4 HTTP Server running in Ubuntu 20.04.
I don&#x27;t recommend editing etc/apache2/apache2.conf because it is the main configuration file of Apache so if you broke that file probably your Apache will not work.

                    <span>I found the linux command line quite intimidating when I first started learning to code. It seemed to require extensive and comprehensive knowledge and understanding of commands and keyboard shortcuts. However, as I read more about it and practiced what I learned, I realized that it isn&#x27;t as scary as it seemed; that It only requires a lot of constant practice. I also discovered that others feel the same way, which made me realise that I wasn&#x27;t alone.
The other thing I discovered during this period is that we are all beginners and sharing is helpful, since no one is an island. So I decided to share my experience with others starting out as well. As we all know, learning is never-ending. There will always be new tools and new commands to learn, especially when you&#x27;re a beginner. The followin…</span>

Working with third parties, contractors and partners who need access to files containing protected data means walking a tightrope between providing useful data without violating privacy, HIPAA or GDPR. 
Let&#x27;s remove protected data from a CSV without writing any code using an example file.

This walk-through will use remove-pii.com. Although we&#x27;re working with a website, no data is transmitted to any server; all processing is handled in the browser. An offline version is also available.
Now, we&#x27;ll provide our CSV to the website. This will parse the headers and allow us to replace any data within the file.  Any unset columns pass through to the final file.

Node JS should be installed on your system.
## What is Passport.js?
Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. It is very flexible and modular. A comprehensive set of strategies supports authentication using a username and password, Google, Facebook, Apple, Twitter, and more. Find out more about Passport here.
Before using passport-github2, you must have a Github account and register an application with Github. If you have not done this, You can do that here.

In the last couple of years, many well-known established companies like Netflix, eBay, or Uber have rewritten their microservices using Node.js. LinkedIn, in turn, has successfully migrated a part of the code that has been written in Ruby on Rails to Node.js. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that robust applications need robust internal tools.
Node.js doesn’t have a default admin panel solution like Django Admin for Django or Active Admin for Ruby on Rails. However, there are quite a few options for building an admin panel for a Node.js application:

                    <span>A while ago, I came across a Brakeman false positive that I wanted to fix.
For a single false positive, it became a bit of an epic journey.
The code looked something like this:
class Task &lt; ApplicationRecord
  enum status: {
    pending: 0,
    success: 1,
    failed: 3,
  }

  NOT_FAILURES &#x3D; [&#x27;pending&#x27;, &#x27;success&#x27;].freeze
end

class TaskRunner
  def get_failures
    start_time &#x3D; Date.beginning_of_quarter
    end_time &#x3D; Date.end_of_quarter

    no_failure_enums &#x3D; Task.statuses.values_at(*Task::NOT_FAILURES)

      SELECT COUNT(*)

SubscriberCheck achieves this by combining the workflows of PhoneCheck, which confirms the ownership of a mobile phone number by verifying the possession of an active SIM card with the same number, with SIMCheck, which provides information on when a SIM card associated with a mobile phone number was last changed. SubscriberCheck can be used when augmenting existing 2FA or anti-fraud workflows.

As digital assets increase in value (in some cases, being the most valuable assets a company owns), threats become more profitable to criminals too. The largest ransomware payout made by an insurance company ($40 million) to date happened in 2021, and the trend doesn’t show any signs of slowing down.
The major problem with attacks like these is that computers today are so fast and interconnected that malware can harness those resources to spread itself throughout the network and encrypt an enormous amount of files before the victim can respond.
Unfortunately, after the files have been encrypted, there is not much that can be done. Most modern ransomware has goo…</span>

                    <span>A recent survey by Red Hat found that more than half of the Kubernetes environments are misconfigured. Even worse, about 90% of respondents had at least one security incident last year, leading to the very first wave of Kubernetes-native malware. In this tutorial, we present three tools to validate and secure your Kubernetes deployments.
Kubernetes main selling point is in its declarative nature — we write a manifest describing the desired final state of a deployment and let the platform figure out the rest. But the fact of the matter is that these manifests are easy to get wrong, breaking stuff in the process.
Continuous delivery with Kubernetes is only viable when we test at every stage. For example:
 First, test the code in the build stage.

It is an extensible and portable open-source platform used to manage containers. It was created by Google, also known as K8s, which makes many computers or machines work in one unit. Through Kubernetes, several people can utilize containerized apps that work together, whether the apps are on various platforms.
Why To Opt For GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)?
GKE helps a lot in app development services as it manages containerized applications. There are many reasons to select GKE, and some of them are mentioned below.
Google developed both GKE and Kubernetes. So, there is an excellent team, and GKE provides easy integration with plentiful Google services.

It offers nodes auto-scaling that Amazon Kubernetes and Azure container Services lack.

Since today’s web applications usually store or send out sensitive data, they attract malicious hackers and script kiddies, at an unprecedented level, to find and exploit vulnerabilities in them for their personal gain or just to have fun.
To secure your web application, security testing is the best way to identify security loopholes and misconfiguration flaws in your application before malicious hackers do. This is achieved by simulating attacks in order to find the potential vulnerabilities in your application.

                    <span>Being a coder I have never limited myself to one language, one framework and I didn’t want to have a milion code editors each specialised in different thing so I have always used VSCode. Keeping the theme, the look and feel of the editor with power of an IDE one plugin away no matter which language I want to jump into is the key factor that guided my choice.
However, I have tried JetBrains’ WebStorm before and just couldn’t get rid of one huge thing haunting me, the project-wide type checking.
In VSCode the typescript plugin works great but it only checks files that are currently opened in the editor! Other files inside the project are not being checked until opened 😕 Now this is a huge bump, having to run the check manually through console or build the whole app in order to check if one type alternation hasn’t influenced anything else? Madness…
This is when I decided to research this problem — and there really is no out of the box solution! After trying every way on the internet I have finally pieced together the final solution for this problem:
{
    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.0.0&quot;,
    &quot;tasks&quot;: [
      {
        &quot;label&quot;: &quot;tsc-watch project&quot;,
        &quot;type&quot;: &quot;typescript&quot;,
        &quot;tsconfig&quot;: &quot;tsconfig.json&quot;,
        &quot;option&quot;: &quot;watch&quot;,
        &quot;problemMatcher&quot;: [&quot;$tsc-watch&quot;],
        &quot;group&quot;: &quot;build&quot;,
        &quot;runOptions&quot;: {
          &quot;runOn&quot;: &quot;folderOpen&quot;
        },
        &quot;presentation&quot;: { &quot;reveal&quot;: &quot;never&quot; }
      }
    ]
  }

This is an automated task for VSCode — it runs when the project folder is opened and keeps on running, checking the whole repo real-time based on the changes you make! Finally! 🎉
Put it in

.vscode/tasks.json




Re-open the project folder and accept the popup asking whether Automatic Folder Tasks should be allowed
If the popup isn’t there do:
⌘⇧p
-&gt; Manage Automatic Tasks in Folder
-&gt; Allow Automatic Tasks in Folder



  
  
  🎉 All done! Enjoy your VSCode with TypeScript better than ever! 🎉</span>

Bom dia amigos, gostaria de citar alguns benefícios de aprender e utilizar TypeScript em JavaScript.
Alguns motivos:
Temos a possibilidades de trabalhar com tipagem, algo muito útil para nós desenvolvedores JavaScript.
Orientação a Objetos, sim, vamos poder usufruir de todo o poder desse paradigma (Class, Interface, Abstract), somando com a programação funcional nativa.
Melhora seu código, seu código vai se tornar mais coeso, bem divido, claro, se você usufruir de interfaces, classes abstratas e da boa e velha herança.
Muitas tecnologias utilizam ou dão suporte ao TypeScript: Angular, React, Graphql, Graphcool e etc.
Lembre-se TypeScript é um supertest de JavaScript, ou seja, você pode implementar ele sem precisar usar esses frameworks citados acima.
Comece agora a utilizar TypeScript e eleve seu JavaScript para o próximo nível. Vou deixar alguns links legais pra você estudar TypeScript:
O próprio site dará todo o suporte que você precisará: https://lnkd.in/dC4bbuX


No próprio site tem uma área pra você começar do zero: https://lnkd.in/dB8pTuj



Agora só depende de você, estude, pratique e use TypeScript em seus novos projetos.
Fiquem com Deus e até a próxima.
Nunca desista de correr atrás dos seus sonhos</span>

                    <span>Youtube’s API provides developers with a way to get push notifications for when specific changes occur on a youtube channel. Youtube’s API sends out these notifications through a PubSubHubbub webhook protocol.
Webhooks are used to send near-real-time data to applications. 
Let’s say you have an application that sends out emails to a mailing list and you only want to send out these emails whenever Beyonce posts a video on her channel. To do this, you can use Youtube’s webhooks to subscribe to push notifications on Beyonce’s channel. Whenever Beyonce posts a video, Youtube will tunnel down a request to your server to inform you of this event.
In order to get the push notifications from Youtube’s webhook, you need to provide Youtube with a URL which you will use to receive the data for whenev…</span>

                    <span>Recently, I came across an intriguing article about (Dynamic self-registered FormControl in Angular)(https://medium.com/@toha.marko/dynamic-self-registered-reactive-formcontrol-in-angular-bf2342b7f14d).
Everything about this article was well done and very interesting.
There was one point in the article that spiked my interest: the author triggered the &quot;creation&quot; of the Form Controls dynamically within the Angular HTML.
So, I decided to experiment and see if I could use this as a means to trigger data validation and transformation.
This is an experiment, simple to see if I can do something. Personally, I see some benefit in the pattern. But, this does not mean I am endorsing this as a good pattern or a better means than any other way of doing something.

One of the companies I’m interested in working with lists a particular technology as a Nice to have’. So, this week, I decided to write my blog on golang, the Go language. Let the endless journey of learning continue.
The Go language was developed by computer scientists Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google and released in 2009. The mission was to address deficiencies in other programming languages used at Google. A few issues the trio sought to address was to create a language that was easy for a programmer to use. That meant having a minimal set of strict rules. They also wanted a language that would compile quickly and could scale to large codebases tha…</span>

It is a part of my future DevOps and automation blogs. So stay tuned for more amazing stuff!!
To deploy an app, we need an app, right? So let&#x27;s create one. But if you don&#x27;t like React, go with Angular, Vue or whatever you like.
First create a github repo (assuming you have a github account, if not, create one and then create a github repo) and then clone it onto your computer. Open it in your favorite text-editor (mine VS Code). Then type the following command to create a react app.

                    <span>Hey everyone!


Nice to see you all around again! Today you&#x27;ll find out how easy it is to use the  react-hook-form  library for forms instead of the normal method of forms in React.

So, the first thing is first, normally, in React we use state, and whenever the value of an input changes, we change the state. This method&#x27;s good but there is a lot of code. Here&#x27;s how the code looks like in this case.
import { useState } from &#x27;react&#x27;;

export default function LoginForm() {
  const [email, setEmail] &#x3D; useState(&#x27;&#x27;);
  const [password, setPassword] &#x3D; useState(&#x27;&#x27;);

  const onSubmit &#x3D; (e) &#x3D;&gt; {
    e.preventDefault()
    // Submit logic
  }

                    <span>From time to time someone still tells me that is using REDUX or similar tool in their project. I usually respond, that I wouldn&#x27;t use it as now with hooks and context API you don&#x27;t need it.
But context API usually brings performance problems and is also a bit awkward to use it properly, so today I&#x27;ll try to show how to avoid common problems, and also build your own (micro) state management tool, without any compromises.
Basic idea is to manage state in one component and pass the whole it by context so it&#x27;s accessible from all child components, so we can avoid props drilling.
export const StateContext &#x3D; createContext(null);
const Provider &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {

                    <span>Originally posted here!
To get or access the properties and methods of the h6 HTML element tags without having errors or red squiggly lines in TypeScript, you have to assert the type for the h6 HTML element tag using the HTMLHeadingElement interface in TypeScript.
The errors or warnings are shown by the TypeScript compiler since the compiler doesn&#x27;t know more information on the h6 HTML element tag ahead of time. But we know that we are referencing the h6 HTML tag and thus we can tell the compiler to use the HTMLHeadingElement interface which contains the declarations for properties and methods.
// get reference to the first &#x27;h6&#x27;
// HTML element tag in the document

                    <span>In this short article I will show how to deploy a Mean-Stack app by AWS-CLI and CloudFormation using a v1 load-balancer 😃
All the code regarding our deployment you can also find here:
https://github.com/TGotwig/devops
We take usage of an very nice and simple MEAN-Stack project which comes from Brad Traversy 🤗
Download the sample repo and cd into it:
git clone git@github.com:TGotwig/devops.git
cd aws-cloudformation/solutions/advanced/mean-stack

Install the awscli from somewhere and login:
aws configure --profile 

You will be asked for two IDs, you can get them through:

 

Create a file called parameters.json:
[
  {
    &quot;ParameterKey&quot;: &quot;KeyName&quot;,
    &quot;ParameterValue&quot;: &quot;&quot;
  }
]

Replace  by your SSH key under EC2 / Key Pairs:

Create a file called .env for the Makefile:
stack-name&#x3D;simple-mean-stack
profile&#x3D;
region&#x3D;

Start it by running make up, an EC2 machine should boot up:

After some time we can reach the app, run make getUrl to get the url:

After refreshing the page few times you should see another IP:

You can remove the entire stack by running make rm! 🔥 
Awesome! Now we have finished our load-balanced Mean-Stack app 😎🎉</span>

So the first thing we need to do is update the existing packages currently present. To do that we need to run the following command in the terminal. This will make sure that you have the latest security patches updated in your instance.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

Now we will install NodeJs. We will install NodeJs using the apt package manager which is the default package manager for Ubuntu. We need to use the following command on the terminal to install the latest LTS version of NodeJs.
sudo apt install nodejs

Verify that node is installed using the below command

For those who are fitness gurus like me, I never quite found an app that track everything in one app without the prescription fee. Even when it comes with a prescription fee, I still am not fully satisfied with what it entails. I have tried using a few different apps throughout the last few years like MyFitnessPal, the apple watch health and even Kayla Itsines &quot;Sweat&quot; app. But in the end, fitness is really about having a truly healthy lifestyle and not just working out. 
Food: cooking, baking, meal prepping 
Athletics: Tracking Calories, progress, workouts 
lifestyle: motivation and a safe community
What you eat is just as important as how you exercise. Meaning that you have to track what you eat no matter what your goals are. I want this app to give people …</span>

                    <span>One thing to look out for in Node.js: functions that may throw an error either synchronously or asynchronously (which, technically, is any function that does async work). You may think you&#x27;ve got pretty good error-handling, but they complicate things.
For instance, here&#x27;s a basic example:
function getAdditionalData(input) {
  const url &#x3D; getRequestUrl(input);

  return makeHttprequest(url).then(response &#x3D;&gt; {
    return response.data;
  });
}

  return getAdditionalData(input).then(result &#x3D;&gt; {
    return { input, result };
  });
});

This is a simple endpoint that calls getAdditionalData() to get some data and return to the user. The function does an asynchronous thing (HTTP request), so it returns a promise.

                    <span>I’m pretty much a beginner dev, working for 2years as a developer. During this period most of the time, I’ve used PHP as backend but recently my company assigned me to a project in which I had to use Node(Express) as backend. So here’s the story about my first MERN stack app.
TLDR

During this short period of my career, I got the opportunity to work with several technologies. As I’m working as a Full-Stack dev so previously I had hands-on experience with Laravel, React, Vue, Mysql other related techs. I was very excited when my company assigned me to a MERN stack app. That was a huge transition. I took that as a challenge and decided that I’d prepare myself for larger apps built with the MERN stack. So that’s why even the purpose of the app is simple but the structure is not.

Vayamos al tema de hoy. Lo primero que tenemos que entender, es que no hay una sola forma de utilizar objetos en JavaScript, en este post vamos a ver cómo utilizar objetos literales y cómo estos nos permiten trabajar con POO de manera muy rápida y nada verbosa.
Crear un objeto literal es muy sencillo, se comienza con la definición e inicialización de una variable o constante (mi post anterior trata sobre esto), así:

                    <span>What is scrollspy?


Scrollspy is a mechanism that highlights an active menu item based on current scroll position to indicate which section is currently visible in the viewport. It&#x27;s available in Bootstrap (see the docs), but right now let&#x27;s implement it from scratch using React and TypeScript.
Before we start, let&#x27;s add some helper functions that we will use for computations in our hook. Also, this way we keep logic separated and make our code look cleaner.
// Restrict value to be between the range [0, value]
const clamp &#x3D; (value: number) &#x3D;&gt; Math.max(0, value);

// Check if number is between two values
const isBetween &#x3D; (value: number, floor: number, ceil: number) &#x3D;&gt;
  value &gt;&#x3D; floor &amp;&amp; value &lt;&#x3D; ceil;

Once we&#x27;re ready with helpers, we can jump to the hook code.

                    <span>Alright lads, this will be a quick one. I want to add the views count functionality on my personal portfolio website&#x27;s blog section.

Expected behavior:
  Blogs Page : List of blogs -&gt; Show count.
 Blog Page : Particular Article -&gt; Show count and  Increment count.
How to achieve:
Use supabase to store count by slug
Stored procedure to increment count
Tools that I&#x27;ll need:
supabase : open source firebase alternative 
swr : data fetching
Create a table views with schema like such:
slug -&gt; text -&gt; primary key
created_at -&gt; timestamp -&gt; now()
count -&gt;  int2 
count:



Fetch count
Increment one
Fetch count again
Now we can reduce this to one db call using stored procedures:

create function increment (slug_text text)
returns void as
$$
update views
set count &#x3D; count + 1
where slug &#x3D; slug_text;

--- scroll down for screenshots, or Fireblog.io ---
I was originally hosted on Firebase Functions, but I wanted it to be a little bit faster, and the ng deploy to Firebase Functions also stopped working as expected. In fact, I wonder what the Angular Firebase Team is doing at all these days. The documentation for Angular Firebase 9 is still not up-to-date, and it seems like they are behind on updating to Angular 13 (to be fair, it has only been a few days at this point).
Before I get into anything, I have to recommend you check out Fireship.io, as it is the reason I have become proficient in these technologies.

                    <span>In Angular, we use HTTP to get data from backend,HTTP methods always return an observable.Generally we subscribe to that observable and assign response data to class variables to use it in our component.
But using RxJS operators we can compose multiple observables(data streams) or process  observable data  before subscribing to it.
RxJS concatMap operator
Observable emits observable).
concatMap operator
Takes each value from the outer observable and maps that value  to observable(called as inner observable) 
Concat all inner observables into a single observable in order  and subscribe to inner observables and emit data of each inner observable into output observable in sequential manner.
concatMap never subscribes to the next inner observable until the previous one completes.
Example:

Run live
Here we have 2 API’s
In the above case we need to take all roll numbers from the first API  and pass it to the second API.

So solution to this problem is use concatMap RxJS operator instead of nested subscription.

First contactMap operator -
getToppers_rollNum() this method returns an Observable of type number[] , conactMap  maps Observable to Observable (inner observable) then subscribes to inner observable and emit data into output observable(top_3_rollNum$).
Second  concatMap operator -
top_3_rollNum$ as outer observable.concatMap takes each roll number from the outer observable and hits http request sequentially(here we have 3 inner observables return by 3 http requests) &amp; emits http response data into output observable(topper_marks$).
concatMap never hits the next http request until the previous one completes.
Shorthand syntax for above code

So,concatMap is used where sequence of execution matters.

Nx Devtools recently released version 13.1, which came with a very handy generator for Angular libraries, which creates secondary entrypoints for your Angular Libraries with ease. In this blog post we will cover why and how we should make use of this new function.
By adding secondary entrypoints, we basically split our Angular libraries into multiple chunks, just like Angular Material does.
// One entrypoint: 
import { MatButtonModule, MatCardModule } from &#x27;@angular/material&#x27;;

// With secondary entrypoints:
import { MatButtonModule } from &#x27;@angular/material/button&#x27;;
import { MatCardModule } from &#x27;@angular/material/card&#x27;;

                    <span>I have added Google Adsense to my angular site. It shows ads on some pages and doesn&#x27;t on some pages. I will show the example of pages which doesn&#x27;t shows ads, suppose we go to this page &quot;https://www.indiantrain.in/train-time-table&quot;, in the search box we have filled the train number and hit get schedule button. It will redirect to other page. Almost all the features of my site is in this manner only. I think angular block the Adsense script and that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t load all the time. As we already know, outside script need to sanitize in order to run in angular. So, I just want to know the proper way to add Google Adsense to my site.</span>

Since the first release, we received great feedback from the community, and we&#x27;ve been working on improving the developer experience using it. In this article, I&#x27;d like to share with you the new features we&#x27;ve introduced, and how to use them.

One of the new features we&#x27;ve introduced is a directive for directly accessing the current route data property from within the component&#x27;s template.

If you’re interested, we’ve also just recently covered [CSS auditing tools](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/css-auditing-tools/), [CSS generators](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/css-generators/), [front-end boilerplates](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/06/useful-frontend-boilerplates-starter-kits/) and [VS code extensions](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/05/useful-vs-code-extensions-web-developers/) — you might find them useful, too.</span>
