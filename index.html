Originally, the generate sub-command only supported generating a stack from predefined service templates whereas the add command could only handle fully custom services. If you needed a mixture of both e.g. an own frontend service and an own backend service, combined with the predefined MySQL service, you formerly would have to generate the MySQL without frontend and backend with the generate command and subsequently add the other two services with the add command.
With v1.1.0 the generate command offers the menu option Custom service in each predefined service selection list at the bottom. If you…</span>

In order to foster a healthy culture while allowing people to flourish, organizations must carefully enact policies. Growth should be encouraged while discouraging competition and comparison. One of the core policies organizations implement to achieve these goals is blamelessness.
Every company can benefit from a blameless culture, and it is necessary for true accountability. However, even when an organization espouses a blameless culture, individuals may hold themselves to impossible standards and blame themselves when things go wrong. They may believe:
Blaming themselves counts as blamelessness because they aren’t blaming others

It shouldn’t be down. If down or crashed, either restart or start a new one as soon as possible.

How to move it to a different machine in case the host encountered a problem?
It’s not as easy as it seems, even for a simple use case.
The official documentation defines Kubernetes as:
Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Running containers on a single host or running a single container is not sufficient for a large-scale application.

What? 🤔
www.google.com) into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (like: 173.194.39.78)
Why? 🤔
Process  ⚙️
☑️  Check your device cache
When you search for a website or web-page , your browser will not know the i.p address of the web server. Your browser will first check its cache memory to see if it has the DNS records for that domain cached. It also checkes the hostfile of your computer/mobile for the ip address.
☑️  Check with your ISP
Your ISP (Internet Service Provider) caches popular sites like Google.com , Netflix.com , (facebook?), Youtube.com etc. If they have the record in their cache, you would skip the rest of the DNS lookup process.
☑️  Root DNS Server &amp; TLD Server
Top Level Domains are .com  .gov  .net  .in etc. 
Master/Authoritative DNS servers which actually contain the server information.
☑️ I am speed
This entire DNS lookup process happens in just a couple milliseconds. For perspective, we blink our eyes in roughly 50 milliseconds. We can resolve most DNS queries in under 30 milliseconds.👀

                    <span>Introduction.


GIMP is very useful, but sometimes doing not well. Or you find a way to capture screenshots via CLI, but the way using xwd command does not work.
In such a case, this article might be your friend.
This article provides you the way to capture screenshots using xwininfo and ImageMagick.
As previous, xwininfo and import of ImageMagick are required.
On Debian and Ubuntu, it needs to install x11-utils and imagemagick packages. To install these, run:
sudo apt install x11-utils imagemagick

Now, we are ready to do!
xwininfo.


To get &quot;Window ID&quot;, run following command in a terminal:
xwininfo

Immediately prompts shown like following:

Select the window you want to capture by clicking a mouse. Then information of the selected window is displayed following the prompt.

The most important is the first line including &quot;Window id: ...&quot;. So the hexadecimal is a Window ID. In the previous example, Window ID is 0x4000001!
import.


To capture a screenshot of the selected window using import command, it needs to pass &quot;Window ID&quot; with -window option.
Run:
import -window 0x4000001 screenshot.jpg

Finally, the screenshot is saved in the current directory!

I will show you &quot;How to capture the whole desktop&quot; by CLI. 
Passing root keyword to -window option:
import -window root screenshot_whole_desktop.jpg

Enjoy!</span>

Linux で時刻同期といえば ntpd が有名ですが、最近は systemd のサービスである systemd-timesyncd が使われることが増えています。時刻同期を無効にしたい、けど手元の環境には ntpd が入っていないみたいだという場合はもしかしたら systemd-timesyncd が使われているのかもしれません。
この記事では systemd-timesyncd が使われているのかどうかを調べる方法と、systemd-timesyncd を無効化する方法、再度有効化する方法を解説します。
ターミナルで下記コマンドを実行します。
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd

systemd-timesyncd が使われている場合、下のスクリーンショットのようにコマンドの出力に &quot;Active: active (running)&quot; という文字列が確認できます。

一方で systemd-timesyncd が使用されていない場合は &quot;Active: inactive (dead)&quot; という文字列が確認できます。

無効化にはルート権限が必要です。
最初に動作中の systemd-timesyncd サービスを停止します。次のコマンドを実行します。
sudo systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd

次に systemd-timesyncd サービスを無効化します。次のコマンドを実行します。
sudo systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd

最後にサービスの状態を確認します。次のコマンドを実行します。
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd

&quot;Active: active (running)&quot; と表示されていた行が &quot;Active: inactive (dead)&quot; に変わっていれば無効化は完了です。OS 再起動の必要はありません。

再有効化にはルート権限が必要です。
最初に systemd-timesyncd サービスを有効化します。下記のコマンドを実行します。
sudo systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd

次にサービスを起動します。有効化しただけではサービスが起動していないからです。
sudo systemctl start systemd-timesyncd

最後にサービスの状態を確認します。下記コマンドを実行します。
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd

&quot;Active: inactive (dead)&quot; と表示されていた行が &quot;Active: active (running)&quot; に変わっていれば再有効化は完了です。OS 再起動の必要はありません。</span>

Today, so many things depend on accurate time-keeping. Thus we don&#x27;t need to disable time sync usually, but sometimes -- workaround to annoying GPSD bugs and so on -- we need to disable it.
In the past, it was common to use ntpd for time sync. Since systemd-216, the systemd-timesyncd is often used.
This article provides you &quot;how to check systemd-timesyncd is being used&quot;, &quot;how to disable systemd-timesyncd&quot; and &quot;how to re-enable systemd-timesyncd&quot;.
systemd-timesyncd is being used.


Run following command in a terminal.
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd

If systemd-timesyncd is being used for time synchronization, you can see &quot;Active: active (running)&quot; in the result like following screenshot.

On the other hand, systemd-timesyncd is not used, you can see &quot;Active: inactive (dead)&quot; in the result like following screenshot.

systemd-timesyncd.


At the first, you need to stop the service. To do this, run following command in a terminal.
sudo systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd

Then disable systemd-timesyncd, run following command in a terminal.
sudo systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd


First, set &#x27;enable&#x27; for systemd-timesyncd. To do this, run:
sudo systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd

Then start the service of systemd-timesyncd. To do this, run:
sudo systemctl start systemd-timesyncd

Finally, let&#x27;s see systemd-timesyncd is really enabled. Run:
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd

                    <span>Welcome back to our Data Engineering Series😊
When diving into the data engineering world, it is important for the set up  to be ready.
To set up a data engineering environment it is advisable to work on Linux Environment. 
To start with we started by using linux as a host machine.
Then we installed Virtual machine VMware. Then on the Vmware we installed the downloaded Windows operating system.
Now in order to make communication between host(Ubuntu) and virtual machine(Windows) we need to make configurations and networking on Vmware.You need to enable VNC connections as shown below.
 
In this guide we walk you through the MSSQL Server installation in Windows on VMware.

We will now install Postgres in our Ubuntu. To install this follow the installation steps here.
For Postgres configuration steps: 
     psql --version





  

  It is advisable to check if the Postgres is running using this command before you proceed
     sudo systemctl status postgresql





  

  Connection To PostgreSQL running.
     sudo -u postgres psql





  

  Installation of AdventureWorks2019 and AdventureWorksDW2019
First in order to start using the databases we start with installing Adventureworks2019 and DW.

Thanks and Happy Learning!

                    <span>Introduction


Git is the world&#x27;s most popular distributed version control system used by many open-source and commercial projects. It allows you to collaborate on projects with your fellow developers, keep track of your code changes, revert to previous stages, create branches, and more. Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) developed Git.
A version control system is a system that keeps a record of the changes in a file (or multiple files) over a period. This is so that a user may return to a previous version of the system&#x27;s software whenever necessary. This article shows you how to install and configure Git in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
In this article, you will learn how to install and configure Git on Ubuntu 20.04 via the Command line.
The operating system running Ubuntu 20.04 Linux
A root or non-root user with Sudo privileges
Has stable internet connection
Terminal window / Command line
Update all system packages to the latest, Run the following command:
sudo apt-get upadate
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

The Git utility package is available in ubuntu software sources, which can be installed by APT-GET. Run the following command:
sudo apt-get install git

Verify the installation, run the following command:
git --version

That’s it, you have successfully installed Git on your Ubuntu, and you can start using it.
Set your global user name and email. Run the following command:
git config --global user.name &quot;&quot;
git config --global user.email &quot;&quot;

                    <span>Gitea is a self-hosted git service written in Go, it&#x27;s super lightweight to run and supports ARM architectures as well, so you can run it on a Raspberry Pi as well.
In this tutorial we will be setting up a self hosted version control repository with Gitea on Docker using Traefik as our Load Balancer and SSL terminations for LetsEncrypt certificates.
We will then create a example git repository, add our ssh key to our account and clone our repository using ssh, change some code, commit and push to our repository.
I will assume that you have docker and docker-compose installed. If you need more info on Traefik you can have a look at their website, but I have also written a post on setting up Traefik v2 in detail, but we will touch on that in this post.

In the past few months, I have worked on my currently favorite project, FAGC. I have created and contributed to other things (notably AwF-Bot). The experience that I have gained over this time was new, as I learnt how to use TypeScript, played a bit with Deno, and even made my own npm package!
The project itself is made for the videogame Factorio, which is a game where you build factories with an end goal to launch a rocket into space. Since there is multiplayer, there will be griefers, like in other videogames. The project itself is meant to make this easier to deal with, as it creates a banlist that can be shared between any amount of servers and can be filtered through with specifications of broken rules and who you want to trust.

Today I will show you the difference between primitive value &amp; reference value.
Primitive value are string, number, boolean, null, undefined and symbols.
All others things like plain object {}, array, Map, etc...
For Primitive value the value is store on the stack, in other word, in the current context!
For Reference value the value is store in the heap, it&#x27;s a big storage that keep all objects and each object has it&#x27;s own adress! (Like house in a village, each house has its own adress)

So in order to get the object through the Heap you need to use the adress of this object!

                    <span>Introduction


Looking for a serverless hosting service is a big pain when you just want to taste or even host a smal project on it. Today, I found a new resource which lets you create serverless functions for absolutely free! Vercel. So, lets build &amp; deploy our first Serverless function on it!
The platform requires us to install its CLI in order to develop &amp; deploy our functions. Lets do npm i -g vercel to install the CLI globally. After creating a new directory, we&#x27;ll initialize it as a new node project.

Vercel cli expects us to put all of our .js files in a folder called /api.
.js files will contain 1 default exported function which represents a REST API endpoint taking 2 parameters request &amp; response representing the express&#x27;s Request &amp; Response objects respectively (just like in normal express.js GET/POST endpoints).
/api/{name-of-file}
So I have created a basic node.js project with following files:



&quot;But how I will create functions without even testing them?&quot;
The vercel cli which we just just installed globally provides a functionality to run the functions on our own local machines.
You will be required by the CLI to login/signup into a vercel account, join me from here after completing that ;)
vercel dev. For the first time running the cli, it requires us to do some quick configs &amp; settings, after completing that you should see something like this:

To check how the functions are working locally, we have to go to http://localhost:3000/api &amp; to access the endpoint in hello.js, we will go to http://localhost:3000/api/hello


Everything looks awesome! lets deploy it on vercel!
Vercel&#x27;s CLI makes deploying functions as easy as running a command on the terminal, we&#x27;ll now run vercel on our terminal in the root of the directory.

HERE YOU GO!

                    <span>Being a developer is awesome. Writing code, solving problems, and thinking of ingenious solutions for complicated algorithms is what we live for. But, the grass is not always so green on this side of the fence. Sooner or later, you need to get your hands dirty and deploy the app you worked so hard on. Deployments are not always easy. To be blunt, they can be challenging and time-consuming. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;ll solve in this tutorial.

Vayamos al tema de hoy. Primero, ¿Qué es el &quot;template string&quot; 🤔?. En la mayoría de lenguajes que se utilizan para el desarrollo web es necesario tener un sistema que permita inyectar datos en una plantilla de texto, PHP, JAVA, .NET, Dart etc., tienen soluciones (en librerías o de manera integrada) para esto y JavaScript no se podía quedar atrás.

The OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks Project identifies the top 10 privacy risks in web applications, the cloud and the global online ecosystem.  In September of 2021, version 2 of the project was released. I&#x27;m going to work through the list and discuss each risk, with references and mitigation countermeasures, if they exist.
The P-10 risk, &quot;Collection of data not required for the user-consented purpose&quot; on the list is the collection of too much data from users.

Hello and welcome to this week&#x27;s review. I am your host Habdul Hazeez.
This week&#x27;s review is mostly about computer security in general with a story about money linked to ransomware and another about a fake &quot;security company&quot;
Let&#x27;s begin.
US links $5.2 billion worth of Bitcoin transactions to ransomware


What a time to be alive.
The interesting thing about this story? It&#x27;s all computer code.
Excerpt from the article:
FinCEN identified 177 CVC (convertible virtual currency) wallet addresses used for ransomware-related payments after analyzing 2,184 SARs (Suspicious Activity Reports) filed between January 1, 2011, and June 30, 2021, and reflecting $1.56 billion in suspicious activity

                    <span>It&#x27;s cybersecurity awareness month and we all should be doing out part to #BeCyberSmart. 
The one thing I see people struggling with the most is using passwords and I get it.
A lot of what we&#x27;ve been subjected too about passwords is wrong and actually makes things less secure. Making matters worse, security folks—myself included!—aren&#x27;t known as being the most communicative.
So, I set out to demystify passwords. In the video above 👆, I walk through how passwords are attacked, the UX around them, what makes a truly strong password, and finally I lay out a practical path for dealing with the mishmash of systems out there.
Here in this post, I&#x27;ll give you the highlights...

APIs are becoming crucial to modern app development. Therefore making sure that the data you pass between your APIs is secure and not compromised is a priority.
Unfortunately, APIs face a number of threats such as SQL injection, Cross-site scripting (XSS), Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), Man-in-the-middle (MitM), and Credential stuffing.
The best way to avoid these attacks and improve your API security is to follow some simple best practices.
Prioritize security
Encrypt your data
Share as little as possible
Authentication
Limit the number of messages
Data validation
API firewalling
API gateway (API management)
Monitoring: Audit, log, and version
Infrastructure

                    <span>If you’ve ever faced such temptation to wrap inner exceptions within some neatly-defined exception type, you’d better off fight the devil. Let exceptions be themselves and freely fly high the call stack. 💸
To elaborate on the issue, consider the hypothetical DataProcessor and the general purpose exception type DataProcessingFailure below:
class DataProcessingFailure extends Error {
  constructor(public innerError: Error) {
    super();
  }
}

class DataProcessor {
  process() {
    try {
      // Some processing
    } catch (err) {
      throw new DataProcessingFailure(err)
    }
  }
} 

Here, the process() method only raises a DataProcessingFailure exception, if any. Whatever exception occurs (e.g., DivisionByZero) the caller of process() just catches a DataProcessingFailure instance. So, DataProcessingFailure is a wrapper exception.
The reason behind advising against wrapper exceptions is the change of behavior that you exert on the downstream system seen by higher level controllers. For instance, you could mask a well-defined exception that itself is an intricate part of the domain model. Another example is when your wrapper could mask network related exceptions, most of which resolve just by retrying, albeit if some caller at higher level of call stack could catch them as they are.
Putting it all together, you’d logically prefer minimizing footprints/side-effects of various components/implementations on each other, so that you could avoid unwanted couplings/special-treatments.
About Regular Encounters

I’ve decided to record my daily encounters with professional issues on a somewhat regular basis. Not all of them are equally important/unique/intricate, but are indeed practical, real, and of course, textually minimal.</span>

                    <span>Let’s say that you’re building a mono-repo app. The structure is dividing some services like fronted, backend and docs. This application and the structure can be handled by Lerna — a tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages. What Lerna does (as a part of many features) is the ability to resolve local and global package.json files to use one and correct packages list and representation of dependencies. This means that you can use global packages in all of your services but if you use some package in the frontend app you don’t need to install it for the backend one. And with the Lerna boostrap feature, you can install and manage dependencies for all of your services with one command and process.
OK, take a look at the repo structure.

                    <span>Most folks these days use the ws package.
The steps are simple. Hook into your express app, do not allow ws to create its own server, pick a path. Handle the &quot;upgrade&quot; event that is the protocol negotiating to go beyond simple HTTP.
import express from &quot;express&quot;
import cookieParser from &quot;cookie-parser&quot;
import * as WebSocket from &#x27;ws&#x27;;

const app &#x3D; express()
app.use(express.json())
app.use(cookieParser())

// all your normal routes
app.post(&quot;/refresh-token&quot;, issueRefreshToken)
app.post(&quot;/delete-token&quot;, deleteRefreshToken)

// and now the magic
const websocketServer &#x3D; new WebSocket.Server({
  noServer: true,
  path: &quot;/echo&quot;
})
server.on(&quot;upgrade&quot;, (request, socket, head) &#x3D;&gt; {
  websocketServer.handleUpgrade(request, socket, head, (websocket) &#x3D;&gt; {
    websocketServer.emit(&quot;connection&quot;, websocket, request)
  })
})

websocketServer.on(&#x27;connection&#x27;, (ws: WebSocket) &#x3D;&gt; {

  //connection is up, let&#x27;s add a simple simple event
  ws.on(&#x27;message&#x27;, (message: string) &#x3D;&gt; {
    websocketServer.clients.forEach((client) &#x3D;&gt; {
      client.send(&#x60;${message}&#x60;)
    })

    //log the received message and send it back to the client
    console.log(&#x27;received: %s&#x27;, message);
    ws.send(&#x60;Hello, you sent -&gt; ${message}&#x60;);
  });

  ws.send(&#x27;Hi there, I am a WebSocket server&#x27;);
});


This creates an echo server that broadcasts whatever it receives to each connected client.
To test this, wscat works well.
yarn global add wscat

Then do this in two separate terminals:
wscat -c &#x27;ws://localhost/echo&#x27;

Type in one, and you should immediately see it in the other.</span>

Although the growth of web apps is slower than mobile apps, web apps hold a discrete place in the business world. Not all business apps can be turned into mobile apps. Because Web apps enrich the business with unique features that will be compatible only with web platforms. Yes! Mobile apps are handy, but it is hard to fit in reports and other salient features into them. I an era when the usage of mobile phones is higher than web apps, business owners still prefer web apps over mobile apps to work smoothly.
Web Application Development
Web app development is the creation of app programs that reside in remote servers. They are delivered to the users with the help of the internet. Most of the web apps are written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Web app development comprises of front-end and back-end.
Importance of NodeJS Developers in Real-time Web App Development:
NodeJS developers are the ones who have the potency to develop large scale web apps with scalability and high-performance. It should be noted that real-time apps need two-way connections. NodeJS is the solution that helps business owners to develop real-time web apps with ease. In addition, developers with good programming skills can make the server and client to exchange data and communicate freely.
If you are looking forward to developing real-time web apps, it is about time to hire NodeJS developers. Moreover, they will be a valuable asset to your company and will transform any dreams into cost-effective apps. Here are a few points that state the importance of NodeJS developers in developing Real-time apps.
NodeJS developers have the ability to build faster and real-time apps that of high-demand now.

                    <span>Developing high-performing web Apps is the easiest way for a business to achieve an excellent online presence. Web Apps can perform all the necessary functions utilizing a web browser which evades the need for installed software. Also, it has the power to use numerous platforms and avoid restrictions like App store memberships, fees, etc, unlike mobile Apps. 
To develop a world-class web App, Javascript frameworks like Node.js, AngularJS come into play. But which one is the best? Node.js or AngularJS?
Efficient Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, reusable components, end-to-end integration testing are some of the primary reasons behind the popularity &amp; success of AngularJS technology. However, NodeJS attracts us with its easy scalability, large and active community, ability to cache,…</span>

Yeah, with some caveats. But before I disclose those, you probably think that I&#x27;m insane for even presenting the idea that you can run VS Code on Android. And you&#x27;re wrong, sorta.
VS Code is targeted at desktop operating systems, such as Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux distributions. There aren&#x27;t explicit &quot;Android&quot; (much less mobile) versions of VS Code. So we can&#x27;t just install it via the Google Play Store or a 3rd party app store like any other app. Rather, we have to run it in a Linux container.
I won&#x27;t go into the details of creating a Linux container in this post, but you can check out my Guide to replacing a laptop with Android: Part 2 article for information on how to do that.

First you have the bin directory which contains binaries or executables that are essential to the
We also have a (usr) user directory with its own bin and s-bin directories; the binaries or applications here are non-essential to the operating system itself and intended for the end user.
You&#x27;ll also notice a local directory
All these binaries get mapped together with the path environment variable and that&#x27;s why you can execute them from any directory in the terminal if you ever want to know where a binary lives.
At some point you may want to customize the behavior of the software on your system
Many of the files in etc end in conf and they&#x27;re typically just text-based config files that you can modify in your editor (I prefer VIM) as an operating system.
Let&#x27;s go back to the root: there are a few more directories here like:
boot: it contains the files needed
dev which stands for device files: here you can interface with hardware or drivers as if they were regular files, you might create disk partitions here or interface with your floppy drive
the op directory contains optional or
var contains variable files that will change
temp is for temporary files

  Sysmon in a nutshell:


Sysmon (System Monitor) is a Windows system service that logs system activity to the Windows event log. Now, it is available for Linux too! 
It was developed by Microsoft as an open source project. Even though it is doubtful to see such a contribution, I am very glad about it 🤭

So, I made a python script that connects to a Chromecast and plays video &amp; audio (.mp4 || .mp3) as soon as you drop your file in the chromecast folder...
The idea came when I was looking for a quick way to share files onto my TV or Google Home Max without having to need a dedicated app. So, I hacked the b*tch!
On a serious note...
 
 
A. Know the &quot;friendly&quot; name of your TV (CASDROP_TV_NAME) and Speaker (CASDROP_SPKR_NAME). 
B. Make sure your machine is running python ~&gt; 3.9.7 (not mandatory, but you need at least python 3).
C. Install all dependencies to run this program: pip install requirements.txt
 
 
Step1. Open a new terminal on your unix/linux based computer 
NOTE: I ran these commands in a BASH environment, so I suggest doing the same...
 
Step2. Open params.sh and edit the  with your own values. I ran into a few mistakes because I was putting in the wrong IP address.
 
Step3. Run the following command in your terminal:
ONLY RUN THIS ONCE!
bash params.sh #you may need to run this command with elevated privileges
 
Step4. Run the app:
1. Start a simple HTTP server:
    &#x60;python -m SimpleHTTPServer&#x60;

2. Run the casting service: 
    &#x60;python3 casdrop.py&#x60;

3. Drop a file in your watch &#x60;CASDROP_WATCH_FOLDER&#x60; folder. Which in this case should be the folder we are looking to drop our files.

 


**At this point, your uploaded files should start streaming on the device(s).**

 
 
CASDROP_WATCH_FOLDER &#x3D;&gt; A folder you drop files in, to cast to device(s)


CASDROP_SERVER_URL &#x3D;&gt; The IP address you get from SimpleHTTPServer a.k.a (http://)


CASDROP_SPKR_NAME and CASDROP_TV_NAME&#x3D;&gt; Displayed name of devices with (Ussually shown in cast menu on YouTube or Spotify mobile app)

Even if you&#x27;re developing JS for the browser, a streamlined development process will probably involve using Node to do some tasks for you.

                    <span>console.log is useful in a lot of situations (although there are usually better ways to debug if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing).
In the browser console.log works well with objects, you can drill down as much as you need. But in Node.js, when you look at the output of a nested object, you&#x27;ll often see this:
$ console.log({a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}})

{ a: { b: { c: [Object] } } }

d: {} was replaced with [Object]. But why?
It&#x27;s because the command line / terminal doesn&#x27;t have a nice UI for drilling down, so Node attempts to print up to three levels deep. Beyond three levels it just prints [Object].
This is controlled by a variable in the node &#x27;util&#x27; module, called depth, which defaults to 2. You can set it yourself here:
require(&#x27;util&#x27;).inspect.defaultOptions.depth &#x3D; 0; // top level only, e.g.:
// { a: [Object] }
require(&#x27;util&#x27;).inspect.defaultOptions.depth &#x3D; null; // print everything, e.g.: 
// {
//  a: { b: { c: { d: {} } } }
// }

It&#x27;s not a great idea to change an underlying variable, as it might come back to bite later. So a cleaner way is to convert the JSON object to a string and log that. We can use node&#x27;s built in JSON class and the stringify method:
complexObject &#x3D; {a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}}
console.log(JSON.stringify(complexObject, null, 2))

// {
//   &quot;a&quot;: {
//     &quot;b&quot;: {
//       &quot;c&quot;: {
//         &quot;d&quot;: {}
//       }
//     }
//   }
// }

Note that the 3rd parameter of JSON.stringify, Number 2, controls the number of spaces of indentation, and the 2nd parameter can be used to filter or adjust the objects and properties shown.
Now you can really see what&#x27;s in those deep Objects.</span>

                    <span>🔍 OWASP has issued an update to its list of the top web app security threats. We&#x27;ll look at the changes and how they impact your web application environment.



  
  
  
October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month. On top of that, OWASP just celebrated its 20th anniversary. To celebrate, we’re going to run through the newly updated OWASP TOP 10 to remind everyone of how you can better protect your applications, your businesses, and your customers from unlawful and damaging cyber attacks. We’ll also be highlighting where the updates were made and why and throw in some tips on how strengthening your identity solution can help mitigate these threats.
The new Top 10 is still a working draft, and OWASP is soliciting feedback on errors and corrections.
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organization that was set up to help raise awareness around web application security and provides guidance on how to incorporate preventative measures into your applications, infrastructure, and internal processes.  
They have several projects, including an insecure JavaScript application used for security training, but the one that we’re focusing on today is the newly updated 2021 edition of their list of the top 10 threats to web app security.  
Updated regularly, the OWASP Top 10 lists the main security threats that affect web applications today. Each entry enumerates the threat, shows possible attack vectors, and highlights preventive measures to reduce the risk of such threat. At Auth0, we take steps to mitigate most of the issues outlined below, so when you delegate your authentication needs to us, a lot of this is already taken care of for you.
Let’s run through the list, looking at the threats and what we could be doing to make sure our own applications are secure and examining some features of the Auth0 platform that help to mitigate or entirely remove such threats.
For a high-level overview of the list updates, please refer to this handy chart, provided by OWASP:

                    <span>How often do you find yourself working with your carefully prepared code, with AWS SDK in place for calling all of your services, and...nothing, it seems that your credentials are missing, even if you have configured them correctly?

If you&#x27;ve incurred this problem at least once, you&#x27;re in the right place! We&#x27;ll see together how to mangle with typical use cases, with an eye on security concerns.
First things first! To understand why you&#x27;ll receive these errors, you must know how AWS searches for valid credentials.
That is the credentials provider chain! Some locations in your computer can hold credentials, as stated by AWS.
When you initialize from the SDK a new service client without supplying credentials directly (supply credentials directly in code is a bad practice, by the way), the SD…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve run into this several times now and I&#x27;m trying to formulate my thoughts on the problem. There&#x27;s a strange dichotomy working in Security: you&#x27;re tasked to review and ask questions about systems you don&#x27;t own, and to give requirements or suggest improvements. I want to be a collaborator with owners, working together in the design of a service, hopefully thinking about a problem that they were too close to see - the equivalent of proof-checking an essay. I&#x27;m seen though, as someone who enforces rules of their own creation, coming down on owners to exercise authority - the teacher with a birch ruler.
Some of the interactions I&#x27;ve had felt jarring because I got responses that implied I wasn&#x27;t a positive influence, rather a blocking one, or at worst, a detriment: loading on work where it wa…</span>

                    <span>Being able to bypass Web Application Firewall (WAF) depends on your knowledge about their behavior. Here is a cool technique that involve expressions that are ignored in MySQL SQL parser (MySQL &lt;&#x3D; 5.7). This post summarizes the impact on libinjection. The libinjection library is used by WAF such as ModSecurity and SignalScience. For more details on AWS Cloudfront impact, read the original GoSecure article.

When MySQL sees 1.e(abc), it will ignore the 1.e( portion because the following characters do not form a valid numeric value.
This behavior can be abused to fool libinjection tokenizer. Libinjection internally tokenizes the parameter and identifies contextual section types such as comments and strings. Libinjection sees the string “1.e” as an unknown SQL keyword and concludes that it is…</span>

                    <span>console.log is useful in a lot of situations (although there are usually better ways to debug if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing).
In the browser console.log works well with objects, you can drill down as much as you need. But in Node.js, when you look at the output of a nested object, you&#x27;ll often see this:
$ console.log({a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}})

{ a: { b: { c: [Object] } } }

d: {} was replaced with [Object]. But why?
It&#x27;s because the command line / terminal doesn&#x27;t have a nice UI for drilling down, so Node attempts to print up to three levels deep. Beyond three levels it just prints [Object].
This is controlled by a variable in the node &#x27;util&#x27; module, called depth, which defaults to 2. You can set it yourself here:
require(&#x27;util&#x27;).inspect.defaultOptions.depth &#x3D; 0; // top level only, e.g.:
// { a: [Object] }
require(&#x27;util&#x27;).inspect.defaultOptions.depth &#x3D; null; // print everything, e.g.: 
// {
//  a: { b: { c: { d: {} } } }
// }

It&#x27;s not a great idea to change an underlying variable, as it might come back to bite later. So a cleaner way is to convert the JSON object to a string and log that. We can use node&#x27;s built in JSON class and the stringify method:
complexObject &#x3D; {a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}}
console.log(JSON.stringify(complexObject, null, 2))

// {
//   &quot;a&quot;: {
//     &quot;b&quot;: {
//       &quot;c&quot;: {
//         &quot;d&quot;: {}
//       }
//     }
//   }
// }

Note that the 3rd parameter of JSON.stringify, Number 2, controls the number of spaces of indentation, and the 2nd parameter can be used to filter or adjust the objects and properties shown.
Now you can really see what&#x27;s in those deep Objects.</span>

                    <span>Written by Emmanuel John ✏️
Event processing is one of the common implementations when building TypeScript applications.
Registering an event as well as executing some actions when an event has been triggered requires an Observable pattern, which provides a unidirectional flow to streams of events, making debugging and error handling with event streams a lot easier.
In this article, we will explore Observables, how they are used to handle event-driven data, and errors and asynchronous data.
 Introduction to Observables
 Observable operators
 Transforming arrays with Observable
 Combining multiple operators for event stream transformation
 Handling errors with Observables
One of the interesting, but sometimes brain-teasing, parts of JavaScript in general is handling events.

O artigo é sobre a relação da versão anterior do Vue com o Typescript e como contornar alguns problemas de escopo da melhor forma o possível baseado nas minhas experiências
Acho que alguns de vocês tem reparado em alguns erros de TS que podem vir a acontecer nas versões 2.x no Vue. Mas por que  acontece?
O Vue 2.x tem um escopo que dependendo da forma que utilizar o TS dentro do projeto o próprio Typescript (que é um superset de Javascipt) tem dificuldade de interpretar/fazer leitura dessas props dentro das funções. Esse cenário ocorre bastante quando usamos alguma prop como retorno dentro do mounted() ou computed(), por exemplo.

I&#x27;ve recently been playing around writing some smart contracts for fun with Solidity and the fastest way to validate the logic you wrote works as what you expect it to do is by unit testing. It was also a fun experiencing testing smart contracts with Chai and Mocha together with TypeScript. It made things quick and easy for me. And cheers to Hardhat for making things much more easier and convenient that it automatically generates all the TypeScript typings of a smart contract via Typechain. In this article we&#x27;re only going to cover how we set it up using Hardhat and how we can make those assertions. 
But why should we unit test our smart contracts? Can&#x27;t we just deploy it manually using the Hardhat deploy script and from the UI we can point-click and test it from there? Yes, we …</span>

                    <span>These days, it is a common trend to build a single page application (SPA) using a modern front-end web framework such as Angular, React, Vue, etc., and a server-side backend Web API. In this tutorial, I will walk you through a complete example of creating a single page application using Angular that will connect a server-side ASP.NET Core 5 Web API to fetch data from a SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core (Code First). At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to display some useful stats related to football players.

A single page application (SPA) is a type of web application that doesn’t load entire new pages from the server in an old and traditional way but instead loads data and contents from the server dynamically. SPA loads all necessary HTML, Java…</span>

                    <span>I was recently working on a button component as part of a Design System based on Angular Material. While working on this component, I faced some interesting challenges which I would like to share with you in this and following posts.
When you want to build your own Design System on top of Angular Material (or pretty much any other 3rd party component library), you have a couple of options:
Build a custom Angular Material theme and use the components as they are described in the documentation.
Build a custom Angular Material theme and build your own component library on top of Angular Material by wrapping their components in your own components.
There are pros and cons with both approaches. That is a topic for another post so I’m not going into the details here. Long story short, we went wi…</span>

Auth0 brings you the new ASP.NET Core Authentication SDK, which improves your development experience and better integrates with Auth0 features! Let&#x27;s take a tour through the main features of the SDK to see how easy it becomes to integrate your ASP.NET applications with Auth0.
So far, you were used to relying on the standard Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect package to integrate your ASP.NET application with Auth0. That library does its job very well. However, when you move away from implementing the simple login and logout, your code starts becoming verbose until it gets messy.

Formerly known as ripple-lib, the library was renamed to better represent its role in the XRPL ecosystem and overhauled to take advantage of modern JavaScript features.
JavaScript is one of the most widely-used programming languages, and as such has a massive community of active developers. Maintaining a JavaScript SDK enables these developers to seamlessly interact with the XRP Ledger, both in the browser and in Node.js.

This article will explain the implementation details of the Select all functionality in the multi-select component based on the react-select v5.1.0 package.

The primary logic of the &quot;Select all&quot; option has been implemented in this function. 
All the elements in the list are selected.
Some of the options in the menu are selected
None of the options is selected.
The first case happens under certain conditions: the current state of the Select all option is unchecked, the length of the selected elements is greater than zero, meanwhile, either the Select all option or all the options in the menu except the Select all option are selected. If these conditions are met, then all the elements in the menu are checked.

                    <span>Lets say we have the following simple function:
const even &#x3D; (a: number) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (a % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 0) {
    return a
  }
  throw new Error(&#x60;value: ${a} is even&#x60;);
}

as you can see if the value is even we return the number else we throw an error. The normal way of handling this would be to wrap it inside a try-catch and handle the error. But when you have multiple functions this becomes tedious and error-prone.
In the fp world instead of throwing errors all over the place, we convert them to data. This in typescript would look something like this:
type Try &#x3D; Success | Failure

where Success is a container that wraps some value of type A and Failure is the alternative one that contains the error.
Let’s try to implement this structure! We will use a mix of OOP and FP, to create nicely chain…</span>

                    <span>This is the rule of calling hooks:
Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns.
For the usage in HOC like below taken from https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk/blob/e2f79f1c156e5e82f70cd88fd2bf22dc3be8ecad/src/withLDConsumer.tsx#L43:
function withLDConsumer(options: ConsumerOptions &#x3D; { clientOnly: false }) {
  return function withLDConsumerHoc(WrappedComponent: React.ComponentType) {
    return (props: P) &#x3D;&gt; (
      
        {({ flags, ldClient }: LDContext) &#x3D;&gt; {
          if (options.clientOnly) {
            return ;
          }

          return ;
        }}
      
    );
  };
}


Can I use hooks in the returned anonymous function, like below?
function withLDConsumer(options: ConsumerOptions &#x3D; { clientOnly: false }) {
  return function withLDConsumerHoc(WrappedComponent: React.ComponentType) {
    return (props: P) &#x3D;&gt; (
      const [name, setName] &#x3D; useState(&#x27;Mary&#x27;); 
      
        {({ flags, ldClient }: LDContext) &#x3D;&gt; {
          if (options.clientOnly) {
            return ;
          }

          return ;
        }}
      
    );
  };
}

I think it is a &quot;always use Hooks at the top level of your React function&quot;, but my friend said it is a &quot;nested function&quot;. My understanding to this is that this &quot;nest&quot; should only count from the function component level.</span>

Effects are a powerful model for handling side effects in your application. Commonly this means when you are making a HTTP request in a NgRx powered application you will use an effect to handle the communication with the service but they can do so much more than that. And frankly this is what I usually used them for until I read https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/start-using-ngrx-effects-for-this#handling-the-flow-of-a-angular-material-dialog . 
I became intrigued by the idea of offloading some component material dialog code into the effect and started viewing the life cycle as a series of events and using the effect to talk to other effects. This can keep components more simple and pure where they use selectors to read data and dispatch actions in response to…</span>

                    <span>RxJS 7 has shipped! For us Angular developers, it unfortunately did not ship in time for Angular 12.
I&#x27;ve summarized key takeaways from Ben Lesh’s talk from RxJS Live Asia and his slides below. Lesh is a member of the RxJS core team and formerly worked at Google on the Angular team.
Lesh said while RxJS 7 was “a bit faster,” the big improvement for the new version is its bundle size. RxJS 7 is 53% the size of RxJS 6. If your app used every operator in version 6, that would require 52 KB, but the same thing in RxJS 7 requires just 19 KB.
“This was done via a refactor, a hundred-point improvement of going around and individually moving around code, keeping the same tests, keeping the same code, and moving things around slowly but surely until we got to a place where we could see daylight and…</span>
