Você precisará trocar a senha do usuário root.
ALTER USER &#x27;root&#x27;@&#x27;localhost&#x27; IDENTIFIED BY &#x27;your new password&#x27;; 
ALTER USER &#x27;root&#x27;@&#x27;localhost&#x27; IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY &#x27;your new password&#x27;;

Assim poderemos setar a senha cadastrada nesse processo em nosso arquivo .env e se tudo estiver correto poderemos fazer as migrations sem problemas.

Recently, I started a small Angular application that acts as an installer for a distributed API Gateway application. As part of our testing and quality engineering, we always inspect our web applications. However, we hadn’t done much with static code analysis. It was mostly security dynamic analysis over our client and server communication. Fortify is a product that we have used for this since the company that I work for owns it, and recently they added support for Typescript in their static code analysis. So this was a great opportunity to use it on our Angular project.
Fortify is a product of Micro Focus that allows security scans of applications. Many people are familiar with “WebInspect”, which some people use as a synonym for Fortify.

                    <span>The JS environment teems with libraries and frameworks. However, with diverse options comes confusion along the way. It is imperative to choose the correct form of technology that helps you achieve what you want and helps in achieving your aim. A wrong decision can eat your time and leave your project in shambles. 
Why Choose Angular For Web Development? Let us look into some of the reasons for choosing Angular for your next project and how it will impact your business.
Parented by Google
Fulfills the Requirements
Purposefully informative
Checks and balances
The first impression is the last
using Angular CLI. All the components have predefined styles which help in the fast delivery of the service. Angular Material documentation is replete with the necessary examples which are required.
Package in itself
SPAs
Module Based
Friendly user-experience
Concluding to the final question- is it still relevant given that it has been here for a decade Yes! Absolutely! It is up-to-date and quite efficient in helping you build modern products. It is supported, powered, and parented by Google, and that in itself makes Angular&#x27;s future bright. However, depending upon your project, the choice of the framework should be taken judiciously. The angular ecosystem is vast and continues to bring a lot to the table. The core team releases biannual versions, making it always excitable for the next updated version.</span>

It&#x27;s rare to see an innovation that actually tackles more issues then it&#x27;s introducing. One of those rare occasions seems to be developing right now - the move towards JAM stack - which is an umbrella term for many technologies, that used together creates a different approach to put content online.
If I were to build a blog, or podcast website I would go with following technologies:
github or gitlab for hosting the repository
netlify for hosting the website itself, and building the code
next.js or other JAM stack framework to build my code upon
some git-based cms, if we want to have more content-author friendly access

For people who use Jupyter notebooks for development and testing quite often, you’re probably habituated to copying and pasting code around all the time.
Deleting test snippets, using a different IDE to compile and test your code again, and developing an API is just a few of the time-consuming tasks an ML developer is used to.
Wouldn’t it be great if we could automate the drudgery of boilerplate code needed to build an API project?** **Here we will train an emotion recognition model in a Jupyter Notebook and convert it into a Flask API project with absolutely no extra code!

                    <span>Hey guys! Andou here, backend engineer / web developer / tech leader for Bitmama Reply, an Italian web agency headquartered in Milan, Turin and London. 
In this article I would like to talk to you about YAGBW - Yet Another Git Branching Workflow, the git branching workflow we usually work with.
Let&#x27;s get started!
When you decide to version control your project (and you should do) using git, you are somewhat asked to choose a branching model or workflow.
I&#x27;ve listed the most common workflows in my tech resources list, which are:
Git Flow : Probably the most famous branching model
GitHub Flow : My favourite branching model, good for CI/CD
Trunk Based Development : A skinny model good for initial project phases
Well, without further ado, here is the branching workflow we usually adopt to hand…</span>

                    <span>In this article we will explain how to create an ec2 ubuntu instance with the Teamcity server installed.
To begin with in this case we will create an instance from an Ubuntu 20.0 image. However, you can take a look at other alternatives that Amazon provides for us here: here.
When we are creating this instance it&#x27;s important to save the pem file, so that you can access the machine through ssh.
After we have created the instance we will go to security and use the Public IPv4 DNS, in order to create a CNAME record on your domain to access that machine. 
Access to the machine




&gt; ssh -i &quot;.pem&quot; ubuntu@ec2-ip-address.sa-east-1.compute.amazonaws.com

Install java 8 to install teamcity




&gt; sudo apt-get update
&gt; sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk

Check the java version




&gt; java -version

Download the Teamcity Server, in our case we downloaded the latest version: 2020-2




&gt; sudo wget https://download-cf.jetbrains.com/teamcity/TeamCity-.tar.gz

&gt; tar xfz TeamCity-.tar.gz

&gt; sudo useradd teamcity
&gt; sudo chown -R teamcity:teamcity TeamCity

To change the server port, in the /conf/server.xml file, change the port number in the not commented  XML node (here the port number is 8111):
Now if you browse the IP address of your server using port 8111 you should see the TeamCity web interface.
Before creating the projects we need to create at least one build agent.
&gt; cd Teamcity/buildAgent/build
&gt; sudo sh install.sh localhost

Finally we need to run our TeamCity Server with the following command line from:  /bin .
&gt; sudo sh runAll.sh start

We strongly recommend that you use docker instead of installing everything locally on this server, so that you can dockerize all your applications.
You can find more information about how to Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu, here: (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

                    <span>Building a Standardized VPC



As someone who is always constantly tinkering and wanting to learn new technology, I seemed to fall into a profession with a never-ending buffet of tools and concepts, the DevOps/Cloud Infrastructure space. Often I find myself scouring Reddit and LinkedIn posts for &quot;best practices!&quot;, &quot;security!&quot; and &quot;cloud-native!; however, I always find myself leaving those sessions needing more input. To settle this void, I decided its time to build out my &quot;Enterprise&quot; worthy sandbox with my good old pal… AWS.
Working with AWS usually takes up 8 hours of my day to begin with, so I have grown quite comfortable with its features, nuances, and pricing models. It is about time I start building more stuff in my free time and blogging about it.

                    <span>In Windows, simple and easy to install python  virtual environment using pip command and we are good to go ...


Here, how anyone can do it.
Open Command prompt or Powershell 
pip install --upgrade pip
pip3 install virtualenvwrapper-win

Remember :- Python.3x - uses pip3 and Python.2x - uses pip
Creating, working and deleting specific python virtual environment
mkvirtual env1
deactivate

workon env1
pip3 install flask
decativate

rmvirtualenv env1

This is like, we can create multiple python virtual environment in C Drive at specific location and can be accessable it from anywhere, if we working on any project or doing something.
Screenshot - cmd

venv for certain task


Let&#x27;s do it.
Open bash ( Terminal )

if not installed, we can install now
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip3
pip3 install --upgrade pip3

Then installing virtual environment
sudo pip3 install virtualenvwrapper
sudo pip3 install virtualenvwrapper-win

Creating any folder in home directory, like
mkdir pyenvs

Making changes to the .bashrc file
sudo nano ~/.bashrc

You will see like this screen

Scroll down (or use Down key ) till the end, then Copy and Paste these below script but find the &quot;Your_user_name&quot; by command uname -r and  version of python as python3.7, python3.8 and python3.9 etc using which python3.
For example: In my case,
&#x27;/home/ajay/pyens&#x27;
&#x27;/usr/bin/python3.9&#x27;





export WORKON_HOME&#x3D;&#x27;/home/Your_user_name/pyens&#x27;
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON&#x3D;&#x27;/usr/bin/python3.x&#x27;
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

Ctrl+S (save) and Ctrl+X (moving out from the file)
And creating python virtual environment either single or multiple times is same as like in windows.
bash ( Terminal )


Screenshot - bash

We will explore the peculiarities of how they store video files, why such files can be lost, and how they can be recovered. In the process, we’ll be using a IP network video recorder Hikvision DS-7104NI-Q1/4P.

Video surveillance systems are becoming the standard option for stores and offices, for monitoring the situation around your house, apartment, or in the street. Not so long ago, surveillance systems tended to be based on personal computers, but these days, the most widespread option is autonomous NVR and DVR devices which no longer need a PC nearby.

So I’ve been learning SQL and something came to my mind. How safe is this, I won’t lie I’ve heard of SQL injections before but never really got into it. But now I know it’s really a dangerous tool if you are not doing things correctly, and the best way of preventing this is knowing how to do it. Also for what I’ve investigated it seems that a lot of sites are vulnerable to this kind of attacks so we have to make awareness of the topic.
The vulnerability is because we are concatenating to the SQL request, making it possible for people to modify the request using their knowledge on how it works. This is further explained in the original article. Sorry for the inconvenience but I found it impossible to structure it here in dev.to</span>

                    <span>Hello folks, 
I am glad to return with news on my web project &quot;Listings&quot;. A contributor really decoupled front JS code into a much cleaner and maintainable code.
However, follow me for a second, I have an opportunity for anyone to contribute under some conditions.
First, let me recall that I used a lot of JS libraries and snippets for front-end; I still let myself tempted with your own libraries or snippets.
Now, let me lay down the conditions that I see reasonable in this context:
At least 5 stars on Github
Clean and versioned code
Less than 10 kb minified
Has an added value
Now, I know the last one is a bit eclectic, but let me give you examples of current libraries used so that you picture the wide range of possibilities:
pell: the simplest and smallest WYSIWYG text editor for web, with no dependencies repo

tagify: lightweight, efficient Tags input component in Vanilla JS / React / Angular / Vue repo

toasty: A minimal JavaScript notification plugin that provides a simple way to display customizable toast messages on the web page with CSS3 transition effects. repo

holmes: Fast and easy searching inside a page repo It uses microlight also.
auto-complete:  An extremely lightweight and powerful vanilla JavaScript completion suggester. repo

jsi18n: Simple client side internationalization with javascript. repo 
avatar: Library for showing Gravatars or generating user avatars. repo 
FontPicker: Font selector component for Google Fonts . repo

stretchy: Form element autosizing, the way it should be. repo



As you can see, the list is big, but it would be suitable if you can deploy the website to get a taste of it and discover functionalities so you can suggest your library.
Let me know in comments if you have any question, also if you need help deploying the web-app.
Thanks a lot !</span>

                    <span>Introduction


This is my tale of fumbling and tumbling into love with MongoDB, as the data store for the product, we are building at Introvoke, to power right scale branded virtual and hybrid event experiences for organizers, OEMs and enterprises.
Most of professional life while developing applications using different technology stacks, I have primarily used RDBMS as my data store. Many times it was Microsoft SQL Server as I was primarily a .NET/C# developer working at Microsoft. I had the pleasure of working with MySQL, PostgreSQL, IBM DB2 and yes, Oracle as well, working for start ups, software vendors, educational institutions and large enterprises. Good and robust products, for the solutions they power and price points they offer.

                    <span>Accessing files from the OS in Node needs to be done in a certain way. 
When doing the import method, I found we were actually only loading the code at load time, and the files were being manpulated during runtime.
import payload from &#x27;./payload.json&#x27;;

This method didn&#x27;t work when supplying data for API&#x27;s. 
The solution was to load in the files using the Node FileSystem module. 
The snippet below shows how to do it.
import fs from &#x27;fs&#x27;;
import path from &#x27;path&#x27;;

const filepath &#x3D; path.join(__dirname, &#x27;payload.json&#x27;);

const filePayloadRaw &#x3D; fs.readFileSync(filepath, &#x27;utf8&#x27;);

const filePayload &#x3D; JSON.parse(filePayloadRaw);

Few Notes on the above.
__dirname is an inbuilt variable to essentially give you the current directory location. This is important as when you run the node using Typescript, you will be in a src/ directory, so when you build it, the file location is wrong because you are executing from the /dist directory. __dirname gives you the runtime location. 


fs.readFileSync() needs to be passed in a character encoding. Additionally fs also provides a readFile() function which is async.


The raw result from fs is not usable until you parse it with the JSON library.</span>

                    <span>You can build completely custom field types in Payload by swapping in your own React components for any field in your app. In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll be showing you how.
Building your own custom fields in Payload is as easy as writing a React component. Any field type can be extended further to make your own custom field, right down to how it works in the admin panel. In this way, you can avoid reinventing everything about a field and only work on adding your custom business logic exactly how you need.
To demonstrate this, we&#x27;re going to create a simple color picker component for use right in the Payload CMS admin panel. By the end of this guide, we&#x27;ll have created a modular, reusable custom field that can be dropped into any Payload CMS app with ease.

As a result, I had the opportunity to interview dozens of CTOs from companies worldwide and speak with several VCs who were interested in the idea of an open-source stack for Programmable Telecommunications.
In the interviews, I found we need an innovative approach to a cloud-based stack for Programmable Telecommunications.
Building an application that takes advantage of the existing Telecom network has always been a difficult task compared with, for example, building a web-based application.

                    <span>Closures could sometimes be tricky to the point that you may find out things too late/costly.
Look at this code fragment:
let a &#x3D; [1, 2, 3];
let fn &#x3D; [];
for (x of a) fn.push(() &#x3D;&gt; x);
for (f of fn) console.log(f());

Simply, we&#x27;ve added three functions to fn that each should return their corresponding value of list a. So, we expect to see this as output:
0
1
2

But it&#x27;s not what&#x27;s going to happen. If you run the code you&#x27;ll end up seeing this absurd thing:
3
3
3

Now, you can guess what has happened. The variable x is not even evaluated at the time of running the first loop. This is actually the correct behaviour, since we just declared a function that maybe called later, but certainly not now. The three functions are all ready to read the content of x whenever they&#x27;ve been called, and at that time x was ended up being 3.
This is quite common to have such setup in which you&#x27;re using the loop&#x27;s variable inside an anonymous function. To make sure you don&#x27;t fall in, pass the value of the loop variable to your function. That is:
let a &#x3D; [1, 2, 3];
let fn &#x3D; [];
for (x of a)
  fn.push(
    (function (v) {
      return () &#x3D;&gt; v;
    })(x)
  );
for (f of fn) console.log(f());

Here, I&#x27;ve used both syntaxes of anonymous function definitions to make things clean/separate. I&#x27;m sure you got the point, but in case you&#x27;re interested to know more, have a look on these great posts:

                    <span>Hey, fams! today we are going to learn how to send e-mails, right from our IDE using NodeJS. The module of interest is called Nodemailer.

🔗 NodeJs 
🎯 Steps
npm init -y 

This command initiates a package.json, package.json.lock, and index.js (main entry file). The index.js will house all our logic.
📌Install Nodemailer
npm i nodemailer

📌 Import the package inside index.js
const nodemailer &#x3D; require(&#x27;nodemailer&#x27;);

👨🏽‍🏫 For security reasons, make sure you install and use dot.env package to prevent your password from being exposed or pushed to GitHub.
Install dotenv
npm i dotenv -S


Require dotenv in your index.js file. I didn&#x27;t require it in this project because I am using dummy data.

Introduction


Hello, and welcome to this week&#x27;s security review. I am your host Habdul Hazeez.
In this week&#x27;s review, we&#x27;ll look at some really scary news, like seriously scary, from printers going AWOL to Artificial Intelligence systems being fooled into identifying someone else as Elon Musk and ATM being hacked by .... wait for it....waving a phone 🤤.
I told you it was scary 😨.
Let&#x27;s begin.
NFC flaws let researchers hack an ATM by waving a phone


NFC is short for Near Field Communications, and like all tech developed by man, it can be manipulated and abused.
In this scenario, security researchers used it to hack an Automated Teller Machine popularly known as an ATM.

SRI é uma especificação da W3C que permite aos desenvolvedores web garantir que os recursos hospedados em servidores de terceiros não foram adulterados. Seu uso é recomendado como boa prática, sempre que as bibliotecas são carregadas de uma fonte de terceiro.
O HTTPS garante que a conexão entre o navegador e o servidor seja segura. O próprio recurso ainda pode ser modificado no lado do servidor por um invasor para incluir conteúdo malicioso, mas ainda pode ser servido com um certificado válido. O SRI, por outro lado, garante que um recurso não mudou desde que o hash foi criado.

                    <span>🛡 Mobile security threats are increasing as more organizations seek to increase mobility. Here’s how to protect your business from the most common mobile attacks.



  
  
  
Mobile initiatives are a top priority for many organizations these days because research shows that increases in mobility help enterprises improve operations and productivity.
However, increases in organizational mobility typically result in an increase in the number of mobile devices that are accessing your systems from a remote location. And for your security teams, this means a growing variety of endpoints and threats they need to secure in order to protect your organization from a data breach.
As in the past, the most common threats to mobile security include mobile malware. However, as Verizon’s 2020 Mobile Secu…</span>

Recently, I started a small Angular application that acts as an installer for a distributed API Gateway application. As part of our testing and quality engineering, we always inspect our web applications. However, we hadn’t done much with static code analysis. It was mostly security dynamic analysis over our client and server communication. Fortify is a product that we have used for this since the company that I work for owns it, and recently they added support for Typescript in their static code analysis. So this was a great opportunity to use it on our Angular project.
Fortify is a product of Micro Focus that allows security scans of applications. Many people are familiar with “WebInspect”, which some people use as a synonym for Fortify.

                    <span>Introduction


Typescript has an amazing support of types, generics and type inference. It&#x27;s also possible to generate a large amount of utility types through generics to make your typescript functions far better suited to use composition or inheritance instead of the specific objects. In this article, I will do a short-dive into the vast possibilities possible with types. However, sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to imagine one-self using these types, when reading about them, so hopefully the examples I&#x27;ve brought from my own experience will at least resemble to issues you yourself might&#x27;ve encountered.
I will introduce this subject with a little detour, instead of jumping into the specific types right away, I want to rediscover one for ourselves. I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re at least somewhat familiar wi…</span>

                    <span>You can build completely custom field types in Payload by swapping in your own React components for any field in your app. In this tutorial, we&#x27;ll be showing you how.
Building your own custom fields in Payload is as easy as writing a React component. Any field type can be extended further to make your own custom field, right down to how it works in the admin panel. In this way, you can avoid reinventing everything about a field and only work on adding your custom business logic exactly how you need.
To demonstrate this, we&#x27;re going to create a simple color picker component for use right in the Payload CMS admin panel. By the end of this guide, we&#x27;ll have created a modular, reusable custom field that can be dropped into any Payload CMS app with ease.

                    <span>Nullish Coelescing in TypeScript is practically a shortcut for the ternary operator, achieved by using ?? between statements or values.
The double question marks work from left to right. Take the basic example below:
const value1 &#x3D; undefined;
const value2 &#x3D; 6;

const result &#x3D; value1 ?? value2;

console.log(result); // returns 6

This reads as follows:
&quot;If value1 is not null or undefined and has an actual value, then return that value. However, if value1 does not have a value, then return value2&quot;
It&#x27;s important to note that in the case of nullish coelescing, only null or undefined are being checked specifically. This should not be confused with checking for &quot;truthyness&quot; like the logical || operator would.
Take the below examples as a final explanation on this:
const b &#x3D; &quot;&quot; ?? 42;
console.log(b); // returns &quot;&quot;

const c &#x3D; false ?? 42;
console.log(c); // returns false

const d &#x3D; NaN ?? 42;
console.log(d); // returns NaN

const e &#x3D; -0 ?? 42;
console.log(e) // returns -0</span>

                    <span>Organizations continuously seek new approaches to build growth opportunities and reduce marketing time. One can increase their organization’s efficiency and agility by application or software modernization. Application modernization is a gateway to continuously improve your organization by refactoring a monolithic application into a set of independently developed, managed and deployed microservices.
Although you can use monolithic applications for a few use cases, modern features usually don’t work in an application based on monolithic architecture. Monolithic applications can become large and unmanageable that require coordination and effort from multiple teams, even if a small change is needed.
That’s why by choosing microservices you can decentralize your data stores and promote polyglo…</span>

--
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine

Once this is done, let&#x27;s quickly check if SSR is working as per our expectation.
npm run build:ssr &amp;&amp; npm run serve:ssr

Node server fires up on port 4000 and I check for my webpage&#x27;s source.
view-source:http://localhost:4000/


ng add @angular/pwa

No extra configurations so far, and that&#x27;s how it will be. Let&#x27;s build our universal application once again and serve it on localhost:4000.
But wait!!! Now when I view my webpage source on the browser, I get this:

So does this mean that my SSR is broken?
Nope! My SSR is perfectly fine :-) Let&#x27;s run a quick check to prove this. Open up POSTMAN and run a GET request against http://localhost:4000. And voila! I see my server-side-rendered page once again!

--
index.html is now cached by service-worker at the browser. The browser does not need to wait for the server to render the content any more, and it simply serves the cached version, and Angular takes over thereafter, like a normal SPA. Open up ngsw-config.json and verify that index.html is one of the cached resources.

Note (and a small exercise): If you remove index.html from ngsw-config.json and re-build your universal, you would see that the server-rendered content is back on your browser source, since the HTML is now no longer being cached!

                    <span>The join method is used to join the elements of an array together to create a string. It takes an argument for the delimiter that is used to separate the array elements in the string.


Here&#x27;s an example:




let arr &#x3D; [&quot;Playstation&quot;, &quot;Rules&quot;];
let str &#x3D; arr.join(&quot; &quot;);

str would have a value of the string Playstation Rules.


Let&#x27;s use the join method (among others) inside the sentensify function to make a sentence from the words in the string str. The function should return a string. For example, I-like-Star-Wars would be converted to I like Star Wars.




function sentensify(str) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}
sentensify(&quot;May-the-force-be-with-you&quot;);

Answer:




function sentensify(str) {
return str.split(/\W/).join(&quot; &quot;)

}
console.log(sentensify(&quot;May-the-force-be-with-you&quot;)); will return May the force be with you

                    <span>The split method splits a string into an array of strings. It takes an argument for the delimiter, which can be a character to use to break up the string or a regular expression. For example, if the delimiter is a space, you get an array of words, and if the delimiter is an empty string, you get an array of each character in the string.


Here are two examples that split one string by spaces, then another by digits using a regular expression:




let str &#x3D; &quot;Hello World&quot;;
let byWords &#x3D; str.split(&quot; &quot;);

let otherString &#x3D; &quot;How9are7you2today&quot;;
let byDigits &#x3D; otherString.split(/\d/);

// byWords would have the value [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;]
// byDigits would have the value [&quot;How&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;today&quot;]

Now let&#x27;s use the split method inside the splitify function to split str into an array of words. The function should return the array. Note that the words are not always separated by spaces, and the array should not contain punctuation.




function splitify(str) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}
splitify(&quot;Hello World,I-am code&quot;);

If you remember from my other posts simply split the string to create a new array of words. A simple regular expression can be used to achieve this result.
/\W/ Matches any non-word character. This includes spaces and punctuation, but not underscores. It’s equivalent to /[^A-Za-z0-9_]/


Answer:




function splitify(str) {
let splitWords &#x3D; str.split(/\W/)
return splitWords

}
console.log(splitify(&quot;Hello World,I-am code&quot;));

                    <span>A side effect of the sort method is that it changes the order of the elements in the original array. In other words, it mutates the array in place. One way to avoid this is to first concatenate an empty array to the one being sorted (remember that slice and concat return a new array), then run the sort method.
Use the sort method in the nonMutatingSort function to sort the elements of an array in ascending order. The function should return a new array, and not mutate the globalArray variable.








var globalArray &#x3D; [5, 6, 3, 2, 9];
function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}
nonMutatingSort(globalArray);

Answer:




var globalArray &#x3D; [5, 6, 3, 2, 9];
function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
let copy &#x3D; [...arr];
  copy.sort((a, b) &#x3D;&gt; {
     return a - b;
})
     return copy;
}
console.log(nonMutatingSort(globalArray)); will return [2, 3, 5, 6, 9]

OR




var globalArray &#x3D; [5, 6, 3, 2, 9];
function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
  return [].concat(arr).sort(function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  });
}
nonMutatingSort(globalArray);

Code Explanation:
First we concatenate the array taken in as a parameter to a new empty array.
Then Use the sort() method create a function to sort the new array in ascending order.

                    <span>Running a bash script is easy, but it does take a few steps and it’s important to do them in the right order. In this post, we’ll go through the steps to ensure that your script will run correctly 😉
The first step is to make a bash script. Any bash script uses the Linux commands.  A script can simply be a file with a list of commands and the .sh extension. If you are new to Linux, you can use this site to practice. 
The second step is to make sure that your script file is executable. In Linux and macOS, you can check if a file is executable by running the ls -l command and then looking for an x in the permissions column. 
The example below shows the difference:
$ ls -l *.sh
-rwxrwxr-x 1 frank frank   43 mei 29 16:30 hello.sh
-rw-rw-r-- 1 frank frank 8192 jul  1 19:41 not-executable.sh

If it isn’t executable, run the following command in Terminal.
chmod +x script.sh

To start a script you write:
./script.sh

I can write a shell script when I need to, but then continue working in Python or Perl or C++ or whatever real programming language I&#x27;m most comfortable with at the time (these days mostly C++).
For example, one of my recent side projects involved crunching data from a database, working with various embedded systems and more. Shell is not the right tool for that kind of application.
Bash is more suited for when you write a lot of commands in the shell anyway and want to automate that.</span>

                    <span>I have discovered and used vim as my primary text editor for the past few years.
Vim, an acronym meaning Vi IMproved, is a ubiquitous text editor available on nearly every system imaginable. 
Even in the most arcane corners of life, you will find a version of vim. From the data center to the local science lab to the classroom to the server farm, there is probably a version of vim running.
Vim is a text editor that operates in the console. It is very popular among programmers, and is particularly well-suited to editing source code.

Vim is often used by terminal users. But it can also be used inside modern IDEs (vim mode) and there are graphical versions as well (gVim)
In this post, I&#x27;m going to lay out a Hacker&#x27;s Guide to Vim. This will be a collection of the best &quot;Vim resources&quot; that I have come across. 
Vim is a very complex tool with hundreds of commands and thousands of plugins that can be used to extend Vim and add functionality. So where do you start?
You can learn vim by exercise. This site offers interactive exercises. Vim is one of the programs you learn by doing.
Of course, the official vim website is a good resource as well. It has some documentation and lets you download vim. If you use Linux vim or vi is probably already installed, the same for Mac OS X users.
How to setup vim for Python. I find it quite useful, as I write quite a lot of Python code. Of course you can write Python code in any editor you want, I find for small scripts it&#x27;s very practical to fire up vim.
An introduction to vim. This article shows you the basics of vim. How to open a terminal, vim and how to quit (ESC ZQ).
Settings up vim for javascript. If you write a lot of JS code, you can use vim. You can also use vim-mode inside visual studio code or phpstorm.
A cheatsheet for vim. Shows an overview for the vim commands. While a cheat sheet is useful, i think it&#x27;s better to practice a lot with the commands.
A list of vim plugins. Personally I use NerdTree quite a bit.
Do you know any others? Which plugins do you use?</span>

In today’s article, you will find all of that – and even more.

LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is a standard disk management feature available in every version of Linux. The volume manager provides a new level of interaction between your operating system and disks or volumes which this system is using. In a conventional disk management pattern, Linux looks for available drives first, and then checks what volumes are available on these devices.
With the help of LVM, disks or volumes can be united into a single space. If the disk space is treated like tha…</span>

Make it build
Does it work?
The Good
The Bad


What can we solve with scripting?
Today we&#x27;re going to try something that will definitely work, it&#x27;s just a question of how bad a developer-experience we&#x27;ll end up with: We&#x27;ll compile our Typescript libraries into Javascript.
This will work because it cuts Typescript entirely out of the dependency equation, but it&#x27;ll also drive a huge wedge into our workflow because now changes to source-code has to be compiled before it can be seen by consumers. And I suspect we&#x27;ll find other downsides too.
Hopefully we can fix or alleviate those problems with some tooling or scripting, but this article isn&#x27;t meant to uncover  the golden solution that&#x27;ll end this article-series… It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m so very tired of hitting errors that I wa…</span>

The Visual Studio Code editor has all the tools to debug Node.js applications effectively. Its built-in debugger can debug any application that targets the Node.js runtime, even if the source code for the application is a language that transpiles to JavaScript, such as TypeScript.
When beginning a debugging session, you must inspect the call stack and any scoped variables in their current state. You can also evaluate expressions in the editor and step through the code to drill into the problematic parts.
Setting up a project for Node.js debugging is not particularly difficult, and this tutorial will help you get it right on the first try!
Before beginning, ensure the most recent versions of both Node.js and Visual Studio Code are installed. This tutorial uses …</span>

                    <span>10 Tips for Safe and Secure Remote Working


Modern employees require more flexibility than their previous counterparts. 
54% of employees say they’d rather shift to a career that offers them more flexibility. In other words, organizations are more likely to retain employees if they offer flexible work arrangements.
But shifting from in-person work to remote work comes with a full host of changes (and something to keep in mind when starting a business). The most crucial one? Making sure your remote team is set up to work safely and securely. 
But before we touch on 10 tips to improve your remote team’s security, let’s take a look at the importance of safe and secure remote working.
Now that more employees are working remotely, many companies are using cloud based workflows, so everyone has…</span>

                    <span>📚 How to issue Verifiable Credentials from Auth0 user data using #MATTR&#x27;s #Auth0 Marketplace Integration.



  
  
  
TL;DR: This blog post illustrates how to implement verifiable credentials using MATTR&#x27;s Auth0 Marketplace integration. Our example features a fictitious university that issues digital credentials for students to use at various retail and hospitality locations—the university benefits by reducing the cost to produce and maintain physical ID cards. Students minimize PII (personally identifiable information) exposure with third-party organizations and the university (i.e., where their credentials are presented).
ACME University, a (fictitious) prestigious educational institution, has been an Auth0 customer since late 2016. ACME uses Auth0 to store data about all its students a…</span>

                    <span>Two general techniques can be used to provide copy protection for a software application. Programs can be protected digitally using software or physically with a copy protection dongle. 
While using software may seem like a simpler method, keeping your software safe from piracy can be difficult. The software used to protect your program can be hacked, rendering it useless as a defensive measure.
Tenacious hackers can subvert the detection and encryption mechanisms put in place to keep them away from protected software resources. Using a physical form of defense like a USB copy protection dongle provides an additional level of security that must be breached to gain access to the projected resource. It’s not a perfect method but is widely used by software developers to protect their work.

                    <span>The graph is a data structure that consists of vertices (or nodes) that can be connected to other vertices by edges.

The degree is the number of edges that are connected to a vertex, for example, the vertex A has a degree of 1 and the vertex C has a degree of 2.
Graphs can be either directed or undirected, directed graphs are like a one-way street, undirected is like a two-way street.

Graphs can also have cycles.

Graphs might be a disconnected one, that means it consists of isolated subgraphs, or a connected one, in which all every pair of nodes are connected by an edge.

Graphs can be used to represent networks, websites structure, also used in path optimization algorithms, there are applications in other fields, such as linguistics, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, etc.

Any longer and all of a sudden you&#x27;ve been on Reddit for 20 minutes. Having a fast build means you&#x27;ve got a faster feedback loop and less risk of having to context switch due to getting distracted.
esbuild is &quot;An extremely fast JavaScript bundler&quot; and in this tutorial, I&#x27;m going to show you how we can accomplish blazingly fast builds for Typescript Serverless Framework projects, all while drastically reducing the configuration complexity compared with the alternatives.

Make it build
Does it work?
The Good
The Bad


What can we solve with scripting?
Today we&#x27;re going to try something that will definitely work, it&#x27;s just a question of how bad a developer-experience we&#x27;ll end up with: We&#x27;ll compile our Typescript libraries into Javascript.
This will work because it cuts Typescript entirely out of the dependency equation, but it&#x27;ll also drive a huge wedge into our workflow because now changes to source-code has to be compiled before it can be seen by consumers. And I suspect we&#x27;ll find other downsides too.
Hopefully we can fix or alleviate those problems with some tooling or scripting, but this article isn&#x27;t meant to uncover  the golden solution that&#x27;ll end this article-series… It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m so very tired of hitting errors that I wa…</span>

How do I use this at work?
Much like in the first tutorial I use this to help create a clickable prototype directly in the code base. This allows our users and SMEs to see the new features and flows directly in the context of the website they are currently familiar with. 
This works really well when you are working to fold a new user experience into an existing system. 
This also works great for new systems when I’m helping businesses transition from keeping their data and business processes in an excel spreadsheet to an application with business intelligence. I usually do a prototype…</span>

                    <span>Automatic global type augmentations with intellisense



If you ever wanted to add methods to a built-in type like Number or String in JavaScript, you could extend the prototype directly:
// Add helper function to number
Object.defineProperty(Number.prototype,&#x27;clamp&#x27;,{

    enumerable: false,
    value: function(min, max) {
        return Math.min(Math.max(min, this), max);
    }
});

// Add setter to allow defining shortcuts for dom elements
Object.defineProperty(HTMLElement.prototype,&#x27;shortcut&#x27;,{
    enumerable: false,
    set: function() {
        this._shortcut &#x3D; value;
        // register key-bindings etc
    }
});

Now, if we try to use these functions, the type-checker will flag it as errors, and intellisense will not work:
(10).clamp(5,15) // Property &#x27;clamp&#x27; does not exist on type…</span>

                    <span>Angular is a powerful feature-rich platform that you can use to create all kinds of single-page apps, ranging from simple sites to more intricate ones. With it, you can build efficient native, web, and mobile apps with a wide range of tools and libraries it integrates. However, there are still ways apps built with it can be improved. For example, using Angular Universal, you can render your apps server-side to speed up page loads and improve SEO and performance.
Server-side rendering involves converting an app to HTML on a server. When you send a request for a particular path to the server, it returns an entirely static HTML page as a response. No additional requests need to be made to populate the page with data and resources as it is all contained in the response. The page appears almost…</span>

Grayscale release, also known as canary release.
The term &quot;canary&quot; stems from the tradition of coal miners bringing caged canaries into mines. Miners use canaries to detect the concentration of carbon monoxide in the mine. The canaries would be poisoned by high concentration of carbon monoxide, in this case miners should evacute immediately. - DevOps Practice Guide
When we use &quot;grayscale&quot; or &quot;canary&quot; in software development. It refers to a small number of users&#x27; test before official release. So the problems can be detected earlier to prevent them from affecting most users.
Pipeline with grayscale release module is a very important tool and an efficient practice in DevOps, but I knew little about this when I was a student. After onboarding, I discovered the power of pipelines.

                    <span>Frameworks such as Angular, Vue.js, React or more recently, Blazor allow you to build highly dynamic applications based on a set of static files. Hosting these applications everywhere should be simple, but the catch is that the entry point will typically be an index.html file that holds the main application logic and connects everything together.
To work around this, you are usually forced to use a .htaccess file or special server configuration to route all of your requests to the correct destinations. This issue makes hosting frontend framework applications cumbersome in a cloud storage scenario.
However, we believe that bunny.net Edge Storage is a perfect home for these files. Not only is deployment extremely easy, but we also distribute and host these files in 5 different regions around…</span>

The main purpose of this file is to hold various metadata related to the project and it is used to give information to npm that allows to identify the project and its dependencies.
To create a package.json file manually you need to run a command npm init which will ask you a bunch of questions that is not compulsory. Just hit enter to complete those.You can change it later.
npm init -y which will create a file named package.json with the defaults.

This is for if you have troubles downloading large files while on a company network, or want to download files faster using Linux or Mac. 
1). Download aria2
Through brew: brew install aria2

Other systems: https://aria2.github.io/

Ubuntu Example:




2). cd to your downloads directory.
3). Run the following command:
aria2c --file-allocation&#x3D;none -c -x 10 -s 10 $URL

4). Replace $URL with the download URL of the file you are trying to pull.
On the corporate network, downloading the docker for mac was taking upwards of an hour. 
Downloading with aria2c:

The download was much quicker due to multi-threaded downloads! 😄
Credit to Aria2 for an awesome downloading tool!
Credit to hmj6jmh on StackOverflow for the solution they posted to &quot;How to make wget faster or multithreading?&quot; which helped me solve my frustration downloading while on corporate networks.</span>

If you are a software developer then you must be familiar with Git. Git is vastly used for version/revision control for software development for controlling source code.
It is a distributed revision control system. Git is better than SVN for speed, data integrity and also support non-linear workflows. 
Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development purpose. Yes you read it correct.
he creator of the Linux kernel designed and developed Git. Git was initially used for updating source code of the Linux kernel from around the world. 
Like any other version control systems, every Git working directory has a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities.

Cloud computing has seen a shift from traditional Java deployments to application servers like Tomcat to highly dynamic environments such as serverless and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
Many of the benefits of these new cloud platforms rely on their ability to quickly spin application instances up to meet additional demand and restart applications to adapt to infrastructure changes like operating system upgrades or virtual machine provisioning.
Deploying Java to these environments has been a challenge, though, largely due to the amount of time it takes even a basic Java web application to start, called the cold boot time. It is not uncommon to have to wait 30 seconds or more before your application can begin serving traffic, which becomes a problem on platforms that scale down to zero waiting for incoming traffic and expect to quickly launch an application to process a request.
Quarkus is a container native platform that addresses many of these performance issues, and in this blog post, we&#x27;ll take a look at a simple Quarkus web application exposing a REST endpoint protected by Auth0.
Quarkus has been designed to address the needs of serverless and container environments by reducing startup times and memory consumption. Perhaps the most exciting thing about Quarkus is its tight integration with GraalVM to allow applications to be compiled into native binaries.
Quarkus integrates with a huge range of libraries, giving developers access to many familiar platforms and allowing for the migration of existing code bases. These libraries are selected or customized to run seamlessly on Quarkus and to be able to take advantage of native compilation.
Of course, authentication is a central requirement of any modern web application, and Quarkus has out of the box support for OAuth, which in turn can be integrated into Auth0.

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>
