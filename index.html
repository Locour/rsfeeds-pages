Race conditions are easy to understand: your expected result depends on multiple events happening at the same time, just like a high-five depends on 2 people slapping hands at the same exact time and place. If one person is out of sync, the other may get a high-five to the face ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Boom! Race conditions explained!

In this article, we are going to talk about UX Race Conditions and using a simple interceptor to exaggerate delays from the API that you can see if you are giving your users the best experience possible.
In the classic sense, race conditions can cause bugs and unintended manipulation of your data. @vsavkin
 shows us an example of how a user can trigger a new request before the last request had finished, causing unintended data to be used.

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a drastic change in the lifestyle and habits of consumers. Spending more time indoors whether due to necessity or not has driven more consumers towards online shopping. E-commerce is taking over the market at a shocking rate. The e-commerce market penetration rate more than doubled during the first quarter of 2020, a feat that could have taken 10 years[1] if not for the Covid-19 outbreak. Out of those hundreds of thousands of e-commerce websites, Magento is the chosen CMS platform for almost 10%. Big brands like Nike, Coca Cola or Ford are good ambassadors for this content management system.
In comparison to other popular eCommerce platforms like WooCommerce or Shopify, Magento offers a strong advantage with its built-in security features.

                    <span>Containerization of apps is a fast-growing practice as many companies are embracing the cloud and DevOps concepts. Docker packages an application, libraries, and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any server. Being that most applications do not run on one single component (even dinosaur apps ü¶ñ have frontend and backend components), we need a way to define and manage multi-container apps.
In this tutorial I will utilize Docker compose to get a blog up and running that consists of a Ghost Blog service and a MYSQL service; both services will use volumes for persistent storage. This tutorial assumes you have working knowledge of Docker and a server with Docker and Docker compose installed.

Compose is a file format for describing distributed Docker apps, and it‚Äôs a tool for managing them.
Ghost is a free and open source blogging platform written in Javascript.
1. SSH into the server and become root
ssh @PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS
sudo su -
Step 2 ‚Äî Create a Ghost Blog and MySQL service
2. Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root directory
vi docker-compose.yml
Add the following contents
version: &#x27;3&#x27;
services:
  ghost:
    image: ghost:1-alpine
    container_name: ghost-blog
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:2368
    environment:
      database__client: mysql
      database__connection__host: mysql
      database__connection__user: root
      database__connection__password: P4sSw0rd0!
      database__connection__database: ghost
    volumes:
      - ghost-volume:/var/lib/ghost
    depends_on:
      - mysql

  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    container_name: ghost-db
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: P4sSw0rd0!
    volumes:
      - mysql-volume:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  ghost-volume:
  mysql-volume:

3. docker-compose up -d
Congrats your blog is up and running! Validate via the public IP address of your Docker server.

TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols that are used to connect devices and transfer data over the Internet.
TCP/IP can also be used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or extra net).
TCP/IP uses:
TCP:
Defines how applications create communication channels.
Manages when a message is broken down to be transmitted.
IP addresses: 
An IP address identifies the location of a computer on a network.
Defines how to address and route packets for delivery.
Ports: 
A port is a location on the recipient computer, where data is received.
While an IP address tells you where to find a particular computer, 
It doesn&#x27;t tell you specifically where on that computer a particular connection should be made‚Äîthat&#x27;s what port numbers are for.

My solution was to create a dashboard that would capture, displaying and communicate service‚Äôs SLIs, SLOs, SLAs, their dependancies and align the service closer to business priorities.
I saw the purpose of the concept as a way of facilitating a conversation between teams about the importance of a service within a microservice estate.

It not only makes life easier, but it also can save you unnecessary costs and resources you really can‚Äôt afford to lose.  
Scheduling APIs for rental companies are the perfect solution for any size project or business. It works behind the scenes to make sure that your calendar is operating at maximum efficiency and prevents you from booking reservations over top of an existing order. 
In fact, this type of API is so efficient even a brand new employee could handle making your appointments without making mistakes. It‚Äôs really that simple to use! 

There are plenty of benefits when it comes to using a scheduling API. For ‚Ä¶</span>

The most important reason to write this is to help others, because this is not available anywhere if you find it.
In my first summer internship we are working on a Document management system designed using serverless architecture. In this project I was assigned this task of sending notifications of S3 bucket to SQS using a lambda function.
So let&#x27;s get started.
Step1: First make a bucket no need to do anything else in that just simply make a bucket with standard storage.
Step2: Now go to Lambda function in services, and click on create a function. Following picture will make you understand.

Step 3: Create a lambda function by clicking on Create a function button.
Step 4: It will show you the following page

But what are they? how do they work? how do they complete each other?
Let us see how deployment used and still being sometimes done.

                    <span>What are ENV files and why as an industry should we move away from them?





Three months ago we stopped using ENV¬†files as the default export option in the Doppler CLI. This change led to a number of benefits including supporting multi-line variables and a deterministic schema. Before going too deep on the technical choices we made, let&#x27;s first go over what ENV¬†files are and how they&#x27;re used.
What are ENV¬†files?


ENV files are plain text files that store variables and secrets that you would not want hardcoded in your codebase. These variables could be a port number or a database url, and may change depending on where your code is deployed. For example, when developing locally you may use port 3000, but when deployed to Heroku your application will need to use the port it&#x27;s dynamically a‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Today I&#x27;m going to show you how you can easily export Issue, Releases, Milestone, Commit History and more from GitHub, using the GitHub Artifact Exporter.
GitHub Artifact Exporter provides a CLI and a simple GUI for exporting GitHub Issues and related comments based on a date range, and it supports GitHub‚Äôs full search syntax, allowing you to filter results based on your search parameters.

The CLI also supports exporting:
Commits
Milestones,
Projects
Pull requests, including comments
Releases

And you can export all of that in different formats: JSON, JSON lines, CSV, and Jira-formatted CSV. And of course if you export in CSV, it means that you can open it in Excel. Cool right?

                    <span>JavaScript‚Äôs creator, Brendan Eich, had no choice but to create the language very quickly (or other, worse technologies would have been adopted by Netscape). He borrowed from several programming languages: Java (syntax, primitive values versus objects),
JavaScript did not have exception handling until ECMAScript 3, which explains why the language so often automatically converts values and so often fails silently: it initially couldn‚Äôt throw exceptions.
On one hand, JavaScript has quirks and is missing quite a bit of functionality (blockscoped variables, modules, support for subclassing, etc.). On the other hand, it has several powerful features that allow you to work around these problems. In other languages, you learn language features. In JavaScript, you often learn patterns instead. Given its influences, it is no surprise that JavaScript enables a programming style that is a mixture of functional programming (higher-order functions; built-in map, reduce, etc.) and object-oriented programming (objects, inheritance).</span>

                    <span>Containerization of apps is a fast-growing practice as many companies are embracing the cloud and DevOps concepts. Docker packages an application, libraries, and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any server. Being that most applications do not run on one single component (even dinosaur apps ü¶ñ have frontend and backend components), we need a way to define and manage multi-container apps.
In this tutorial I will utilize Docker compose to get a blog up and running that consists of a Ghost Blog service and a MYSQL service; both services will use volumes for persistent storage. This tutorial assumes you have working knowledge of Docker and a server with Docker and Docker compose installed.

Compose is a file format for describing distributed Docker apps, and it‚Äôs a tool for managing them.
Ghost is a free and open source blogging platform written in Javascript.
1. SSH into the server and become root
ssh @PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS
sudo su -
Step 2 ‚Äî Create a Ghost Blog and MySQL service
2. Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root directory
vi docker-compose.yml
Add the following contents
version: &#x27;3&#x27;
services:
  ghost:
    image: ghost:1-alpine
    container_name: ghost-blog
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:2368
    environment:
      database__client: mysql
      database__connection__host: mysql
      database__connection__user: root
      database__connection__password: P4sSw0rd0!
      database__connection__database: ghost
    volumes:
      - ghost-volume:/var/lib/ghost
    depends_on:
      - mysql

  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    container_name: ghost-db
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: P4sSw0rd0!
    volumes:
      - mysql-volume:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  ghost-volume:
  mysql-volume:

3. docker-compose up -d
Congrats your blog is up and running! Validate via the public IP address of your Docker server.

                    <span>First up some basics
WSL2 with ubuntu 20.04
A lot of the logic in the scripts I write rely on bash&#x27;s if.. then.. else. The basic syntax of the statement is as follows:
 
    if [ {statement} {operator} {value} ]
[...] tells bash to evaluate the command and return 0 or 1 for the conditional expression inside the square brackets.
tldr; ensure things evaluate correctly.
&gt; is used to redirect the output of a command somewhere.
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$ cp file1 file2
   cp: cannot stat &#x27;file1&#x27;: No such file or directory
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$ cp file1 file2 &gt;&amp;- 2&gt;&amp;-
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$

$? returns the success of the previous command, 0 for success and &gt;&#x3D; 1 for failure. Lets look at the previous example and see what the output is.
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$ cp file1 file2 &gt;&amp;- 2&gt;&amp;-
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$ echo $?
   1

   #!/bin/bash
   cp file1 file2 &gt;&amp;- 2&gt;&amp;-
   if [&quot;$?&quot; &#x3D; &quot;1&quot; ]
   then
      touch file1
      cp file1 file2
   else
     echo &quot;File copied to file 2&quot; 
   fi


#!/bin/bash
# Check we have a parameter

if [ &quot;$1&quot; &#x3D; &quot;&quot; ]
then
   echo &quot;syntax: old {filename}&quot;
fi

# Copy the file as .old
newFileName&#x3D;&quot;$1.old&quot;
echo $newFileName
cp $1 $newFileName &gt;&amp;- 2&gt;&amp;-

if [ &quot;$?&quot; &#x3D; &quot;0&quot; ]
then
      echo &quot;File has aged and has had &#x27;.old&#x27; appended to it&quot;
      exit 0
else
     echo &quot;File has not been born yet or you do not have parental rights to the file.&quot;
     exit 1
fi

But wait, what exactly is a backdoor?
Well, I&#x27;m not going to go into as much detail as Wikipedia, but here&#x27;s:
A backdoor is a hidden piece of code, script, or a program that is placed on a system for persistence purposes, with that you don‚Äôt have to exploit the same system twice. It simply gives you quicker and instant access to the system.
Now that we know what a backdoor is, it‚Äôs time to find out where attackers typically hide them in a Linux system. I‚Äôll be using the Pinky‚Äôs Palace machine from VulnHub and let‚Äôs pretend it has been compromised by attackers.
When the attackers insert their public keys into one of the user&#x27;s or root&#x27;s authorized_keys file, it can be considered as a backdoor.

                    <span>In this article, we&#x27;ll explain how to install Dotnet Core on Ubuntu.
.NET Core is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications. Software developers often need to use the Dotnet core framework on the Linux system to test, run, and build the packages.
The notion of using Dotnet on Linux comes true through the new Dotnet core, which is an API based modular system of Microsoft‚Äôs Dotnet framework. But the Dotnet core doesn‚Äôt act as a single API; it functions as a shared or public library of API and codes.
Prerequisites
An Ubuntu installed system.
A root user access of normal user with administrative privileges.

                    <span>If you were using only CommonJS syntax you would &quot;solve&quot; this by using the NODE_PATH environment variable, but that won&#x27;t work with native ES modules. The good news is that we can still achieve our goal. The somewhat bad news is that you won&#x27;t be using the beloved import keyword. What I will show you now is how you can make your own require function that works with native ES modules.
Before I begin let me just say I do not encourage using non-local dependencies in &quot;production apps&quot;, or libraries or really anything that is meant to be deployed on a remote server. The use case I have for this is focused more on creating scripts for personal use.
With that out the way, lets go back to what&#x27;s important.
Did you know there is a module called module? Yeah, and it has everything we need.

                    <span>Hello everyoneüëã
In this article, we are going to see how we can generate a PDF of any HTML element in the browser i.e, entirely client-side.
We will use the package html2pdf to generate the PDF.
html2pdf is using html2canvas to convert the HTML element to canvas and then into an image. Then it generates the PDF of the image with the help of jsPDF.
If you want to know more about html2canvas, check out this article.
Let us see a small implementation of the package html2pdf.
A basic HTML page, where the package&#x27;s bundle link is included.
Created a div block of simple content and a export PDF button. We will be generating a PDF of the div whose id is view on clicking the export PDF button.

                    <span>Grouparoo uses Next.js to build our web frontend(s), and we distribute these frontend User Interfaces (UIs) via NPM as packages, e.g. @grouparoo/ui-community. This allows Grouparoo users to choose which UI they want to use (or none) by changing their package.json:
Example package.json for a Grouparoo project:

                    <span>In this article, I will detail how to setup your first NodeJS web server setup on your device and connect to a web page locally. It won&#x27;t take longer than 10 minutes.
Step 1:
Go to the Google Play Store then install Dory (Dory is NodeJS Web Server)

Hit the install button and await the app to finish downloading and installing.
Step 2:
Locate the app on your device and launch it.
As the app launches you will see a notification at the bottom, informing you of both Node and NPM installing.
After this, another notification will inform you that they have been installed Server successfully.
Next, the NodeJS server will boot automatically, you can see this in the notification center.
Step 3:
Time to write some code and serve our first page!
Find the + icon at the bottom right of the app and tap it.
Then, tap the ‚ÄòEval Script‚Äô button.
Delete out the console.log(&#x27;hello world&#x27;); code.
Add the following code block to the file as example:




const http &#x3D; require(&#x27;http&#x27;);

let app &#x3D; http.createServer((req, res) &#x3D;&gt; {  
    // Set a response type of plain text for the response
    res.writeHead(200, {&#x27;Content-Type&#x27;: &#x27;text/plain&#x27;});

    // Send back a response and end the connection
    res.end(&#x27;NodeJS Server Online!&#x27;);
});

// Start the server on port 3000
app.listen(3000, &#x27;localhost&#x27;);

Step 4:
Go to the top right settings menu and use the &quot;save as&quot; feature, save it as server.js es example in your documents folder.
Navigate back to the home panel and make sure that the widget for the file is present and secondly make sure the ‚ÄòStart‚Äô button is greyed out, meaning its active.
If not, you can hit the + button, add file, and open the file from your documents folder.
Now you can open up your favorite browser, and navigate to http://localhost:3000. Then, Congratulations you have installed &amp;  launched Node JS Web Server in your Android Phone or on your Android Tablet.
Hope you learned something new.</span>

Even if you are beginner feel free to try this tutorial, we gonna start from scratch. We also gonna write Auth middleware, which allow only authenticated people to access the route.

                    <span>I recently started to learn React and decided to go practical by building a site called Make.rs - a place where makers show what they are working on - and which, in essence, is a Create React App powered by an API developed in NodeJS. I soon realized that social sharing is something almost impossible to do due to technical limitations: CRA executes the Javascript on the client side hence the social crawlers cannot read the updated meta tags.  Even if Helmet works well for SEO purposes, as search engine crawlers are able to execute Javascript, this is not the case for social crawlers (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn..) yet.

Before diving in, I would like to point I am not a web developer and far from being keen on any modern rapid development framework. So, no React, Vue, Bootstrap, GraphQL in my CV!!
Still I am just a developer learning and always choosing the easiest path and the most efficient (in general less libraries means more performant, in general).
Enough mumbling! 
Listings is like the listing paper in a newspaper, It is 100% people&#x27;s voice, like announces, readers articles, donations, etc.
Operations are not yet asynchronous, I would like to re-implement all of them as a next step.

I recently read this quote on the internet and although it is funny, it got me thinking why would someone say this? Thus this post. In this post, we will see why we should not use eval in JavaScript.
To understand why to avoid eval, we first need to understand what eval is. We are not going deep into what eval is and why it exists. We will see its definition and a simple example. If you want to learn more about eval, here is a great post on MDN.
The eval() function evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string.
Eval is a function in JavaScript that expects a string as a parameter and executes that string as code. If you pass an expression to it, it will execute that expression. If you pass multiple JavaScript statements to it, it will‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Learning a new Node.js framework can be daunting given the speed at which the ecosystem moves these days. Also some of the information on learning new techniques with Node.js is outdated - for example the sheer number of Express tutorials you still find out there! Express is long overdue for a replacement, and Fastify fits right in!  One of the first things to consider when running a Node.js server is how to handle logging the right way. ExpressJS did not offer anything out of the box, forcing another bike shed to paint amongst your team.  Fastify on the other hand recognizes that this is a critical piece of running a server and provides sensible defaults - in the case of logging - the pino logger.

Does it need punctuations? How do you add them? How many?
Non-passphrase?

Lastly, how many masters do you have? How closely they are related?
Related, also. How about numerical PINs?</span>

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a drastic change in the lifestyle and habits of consumers. Spending more time indoors whether due to necessity or not has driven more consumers towards online shopping. E-commerce is taking over the market at a shocking rate. The e-commerce market penetration rate more than doubled during the first quarter of 2020, a feat that could have taken 10 years[1] if not for the Covid-19 outbreak. Out of those hundreds of thousands of e-commerce websites, Magento is the chosen CMS platform for almost 10%. Big brands like Nike, Coca Cola or Ford are good ambassadors for this content management system.
In comparison to other popular eCommerce platforms like WooCommerce or Shopify, Magento offers a strong advantage with its built-in security features.

                    <span>Generating certificates for your company or for development purpose can be challenging and a lot of solutions exist to provide easy setup and management of your certificates.
Eventually you also have CertsGenerator which does it in a very simple but nevertheless efficient manner: just create a json file with the appropriate configuration and let the application generate the certificates for you!
This application uses pyca under the hood , which is one of the main library for the Python language that manages x.509 certificates along with the cryptographic materials. As you may know, x.509 uses these materials to work with certificates and pyca handles under the hood all you need to safely do the job.
CertsGenerator acts as an interface between pyca, and the JSON configuration file in order to generate x.509 certificates:

this. Other examples are in these testing configuration files but you can adapt it depending on your needs.

O TLS √© um padr√£o que segue o RFC 2246, na verdade com a mudan√ßa das vers√µes ele mudou de RFC, mas a RFC 8446 √© a mais recente. 
Uma observa√ß√£o, quem publica todos os RFCs, seja do jwt, jwe, TLS, e afins, √© a IETF | Internet Engineering Task Force (https://www.ietf.org/). Mas voltando... 
O TLS, ele usa criptogr√°fia sim√©trica, em palavras simpl√≥rias, a criptogr√°fia sim√©trica, s√£o ambos os lados compartilhando o mesmo segredo, e iso torna ela menos segura, se for compara a criptografia chave p√∫blica/privada. Por√©m, voc√™ ganha mais velocidade ao usar o modo sim√©trico, sabemos que existe esse grande impace VELOCIDADE x SEGURAN√áA.
 Por que n√£o se utiliza chave assim√©trica durante toda a comunica√ß√£o?
Este tipo de criptografia √© muito custoso em termos computacionais, devido √† quantidade de opera√ß√µes que s√£o realizadas.
Algoritmos mais famosos usados no TLS

Benchmarks dos Algoritmos:

E o intuito do TLS, √© substituir o SSL, j√° que  ele se tornou mais eficaz no quesito prote√ß√£o de acesso a sites.
Benchmarks com o TLS ativado e TLS desativado 

O TLS possui tr√™s subprotocolos que permitem √†s partes chegarem a um acordo sobre os par√¢metros de seguran√ßa que ser√£o utilizados na camada de registro para autentica√ß√£o, comunica√ß√£o e para reportar condi√ß√µes de erro entre as partes.
O sistema √© t√£o forte quanto mais forte for o mais fraco algoritmo de troca de chaves e autentica√ß√£o suportado pelo TLS, e somente algoritmos de criptografia dignos de confian√ßa dever ser usados. Chaves curtas s√≥ devem ser usadas se o valor do dado vale menos que o esfor√ßo necess√°rio para decript√°-lo.</span>

But wait, what exactly is a backdoor?
Well, I&#x27;m not going to go into as much detail as Wikipedia, but here&#x27;s:
A backdoor is a hidden piece of code, script, or a program that is placed on a system for persistence purposes, with that you don‚Äôt have to exploit the same system twice. It simply gives you quicker and instant access to the system.
Now that we know what a backdoor is, it‚Äôs time to find out where attackers typically hide them in a Linux system. I‚Äôll be using the Pinky‚Äôs Palace machine from VulnHub and let‚Äôs pretend it has been compromised by attackers.
When the attackers insert their public keys into one of the user&#x27;s or root&#x27;s authorized_keys file, it can be considered as a backdoor.

I recently read this quote on the internet and although it is funny, it got me thinking why would someone say this? Thus this post. In this post, we will see why we should not use eval in JavaScript.
To understand why to avoid eval, we first need to understand what eval is. We are not going deep into what eval is and why it exists. We will see its definition and a simple example. If you want to learn more about eval, here is a great post on MDN.
The eval() function evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string.
Eval is a function in JavaScript that expects a string as a parameter and executes that string as code. If you pass an expression to it, it will execute that expression. If you pass multiple JavaScript statements to it, it will‚Ä¶</span>

Three months ago we stopped using ENV¬†files as the default export option in the Doppler CLI. This change led to a number of benefits including supporting multi-line variables and a deterministic schema. Before going too deep on the technical choices we made, let&#x27;s first go over what ENV¬†files are and how they&#x27;re used.
What are ENV¬†files?


ENV files are plain text files that store variables and secrets that you would not want hardcoded in your codebase. These variables could be a port number or a database url, and may change depending on where your code is deployed. For example, when developing locally you may use port 3000, but when deployed to Heroku your application will need to use the port it&#x27;s dynamically a‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>The switch statements does not enforce exhaustive pattern matching (objective), the syntax is incredibly ugly (subjective) and is a poorly designed language feature (arguably objective). Thankfully, we can eliminate the shortcomings of the switch statement and improve the quality of our code using pattern matching instead.
There is a TC39 Stage 1 pattern matching proposal for the curious types here.
Say you have a string literal union type:
type Icon &#x3D; &quot;chart&quot; | &quot;file-check&quot; | &quot;paper-plane&quot; | &quot;users&quot;;

and you want to conditionally render the appropriate icon so your first approach is the old trusted switch statement:

                    <span>Typescript unions can be very useful in a lot of cases. They can be used to implement algebraic data types when having a discriminator key. Without such a discriminator, they can be quite limiting. This guide describes merging an object union - another pattern that can be used to enhance type union usability.
TL;DR; This article shows you how to merge a type union (of objects) into a single object type. Find all the steps in the typescript playground here.
Suppose we have the following types:
type t1 &#x3D; {
  a: string;
  b: number;

                    <span>Have you ever written code like this?
const result &#x3D; a || b;

It works pretty well until it doesn&#x27;t.
Using the logical OR to get a value or a fallback works 90% of the time you use it. But the other 10% are actually when you hit falsy values, which might otherwise be perfectly valid.
One point you can usually see such code at is the beginning of functions that don&#x27;t use default parameters, like seen here:
const myFunction &#x3D; (parameter) &#x3D;&gt; {
  const cleanedParameter &#x3D; parameter || &#x27;a default value&#x27;;
// ... more code ...
}

If you call it like this:
myFunction();

or like this:
myFunction(null);

it works perfectly fine.
But what if the following call was actually a valid one?
myFunction(&#x27;&#x27;);

Well, the empty string is a falsy value and will thus be replaced with the default value. And this is where you hit the 10% where the logical OR doesn&#x27;t help you anymore.
The nullish coalescing operator works nearly identical to the logical OR, but it only reacts to null and undefined. Instead of two pipes, you place two question marks, and it looks like below:
const result &#x3D; a ?? b;

If you now replace the logical OR in your function with the nullish coalescing operator like this:
const myFunction &#x3D; (parameter) &#x3D;&gt; {
  const cleanedParameter &#x3D; parameter ?? &#x27;a default value&#x27;;
// ... more code ...
}

making the same call with the empty string as before:
myFunction(&#x27;&#x27;);

will lead to the empty string being treated as a valid value again.
No matter what falsy value you pass from now on, be it the empty string, the number 0, or else, only null and undefined will be treated.

                    <span>There are a number of articles out there describing various methods of configuring google analytics with next.js -- all written with untyped JavaScript. This article aims to remedy the absence of a strongly typed reference. The official next.js example serves as a good reference, yet, it too lacks strong types as it is written with JavaScript.
@types/gtag.js as a dev dependency


Open your terminal and run
yarn add -D @types/gtag.js

We will not be needing the vanilla (non-typed) gtag.js package, the react-ga package, or any other package for that matter. This is where declaration (**/*.d.ts) files really shine! Before getting started, navigate to your tsconfig.json file and ensure that the include flag specifies the **/*.d.ts glob pattern
&quot;include&quot;: [&quot;**/*.d.ts&quot;, &quot;**/*.ts&quot;, &quot;**/*.tsx&quot;, &quot;*‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Prettier is a wonderful tool. It  works in many editors and supports many languages.
But opinionated code formatter is his best feature and the first reason to use it.
When you begin with a new team, the first pain is define the style guide for the project. More the language is permissive, harder is the debate.
With Prettier, debate is closed, because most of the decisions are taken. He has few options, so it&#x27;s easy to configure. All you need is a json file named .prettierrc.json.
That&#x27;s mine, for example :
{
  &quot;useTabs&quot;: false,
  &quot;printWidth&quot;: 90,
  &quot;tabWidth&quot;: 2,
  &quot;singleQuote&quot;: true,
  &quot;jsxBracketSameLine&quot;: false
}

If you use Visual Studio Code, add the Prettier extension and enable format on save feature. Each time you save a file, Prettier will run and autoformat. It&#x27;s convenient.
If you don&#x27;t know what is a pre-commit or a post-commit, they&#x27;re scripts which execute during the workflow of a commit with git.
All you need is define a precommit file like this one.
#!/bin/sh
FILES&#x3D;$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter&#x3D;ACMR &quot;*.js&quot; &quot;*.ts&quot; &quot;*.tsx&quot; &quot;*.scss&quot; | sed &#x27;s| |\\ |g&#x27;)
[ -z &quot;$FILES&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exit 0

# Prettify all selected files
echo &quot;$FILES&quot; | xargs ./node_modules/.bin/prettier --write

# Add back the modified/prettified files to staging
echo &quot;$FILES&quot; | xargs git add

exit 0

This file is for a TypeScript project with SCSS, so you can update file extensions to fit yours.
It&#x27;s run Prettier and add updated files to staging.
And a post commit to update index.
#!/bin/sh

git update-index -g

Create a .githooks folder at the root of your project and put a pre-commit and  post-commit files inside with the content above.
The last commands to type is to tell git the folder of hooks and make them executable. Execute them in your terminal.
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
chmod +x .githooks/*

This post is short but it&#x27;s everything you need to work with Prettier.
Another tools exists to create hooks, like Husky.

                    <span>Introduction


I decided I was tired of a GitFlow process. Every time I had to write a commit I had to prepend the JIRA ticket to the commit message, &quot;It&#x27;s in the branch, why can&#x27;t it just take it from the branch!?&quot; I kept asking myself. Finally, I said, I will just make that happen.
Enter in the concept of Git Hooks, more famously known through tooling like Husky (awesome tool btw), however, there is a Git Hook for just about any part of the process of Git, and they have examples (written in shell, I&#x27;ll get more into that later) in the .git/hooks directory. Ok so it&#x27;s right there, I made a hook what is the big deal? I thought to myself &quot;It took me forever to do this because of the overhead what if I removed that for others?&quot; So I did. 

Technologies:
TypeScript 
NPM/NPX 
Oclif 
Enquirer
So it might come as a bit of a surprise but there are only 2 shell files in this whole CLI tool. They really just execute the JavaScript. Even crazier, I made the commit-msg hook entirely JavaScript little trick that I will get into later.
I will go over the CLI &amp; Git Commit Message Hook in the following 2 more blog articles in the series. I want to keep this one short and more of a summary.</span>

                    <span>Hi guys! I am going to explain you to how to setup your local environment and workspace for create your first Angular application locally using Angular CLI tool. Simply following my steps finally, you can create Angular applications and configure application yourself. I am using my Windows pc to show you to understand the commands I used to create Angular application.
Step 01


Before create application there are some prerequisites.
1. You should be familiar with following.
JavaScript
HTML
CSS
TypeScript (Not required)
2. To install Angular on your local system, you must install following.
Node.js (Version: Current, Active LTS or Maintenance LTS) 
You can  download and install Node.js follow this  link. If you already installed Node.js you can run this command on terminal window.
node -v

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(3 min)</span>
                    <span>In this article I will show you how to dockerize an angular application using nginx server. If you would like more information about the nginx server  you can find it here: https://www.nginx.com/
To get started we create a dockerfile with two stages:
Stage 1
Copy the angular code from a local machine to a docker machine.
Copy the packages.json to install dependencies.
Install the angular-cli and npm dependencies.
Build an angular application.
For this stage we use a node machine image from the dockerhub https://hub.docker.com/_/node
Stage 2
Copy the angular dist folder from the previous docker machine named build on to the nginx location folder.
Then we use the default cmd that starts the nginx server. 
For this stage we will use a node machine from the dockerhub https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx
FROM node:12.7-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY / ./
COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install -g @angular/cli@10.0.4 &amp;&amp; \
    npm install &amp;&amp; \
    ng build
COPY . .

FROM nginx:1.17.1-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from&#x3D;build /app/dist/ui /usr/share/nginx/html

Once that is done, we will create the Dockerfile, and build the image to run it.
&gt; docker build -t  -f Dockerfile .

Now we can verify if the image is created by running the following command.
&gt; docker images

Now that we have created the image in order to run it we have two options:. 
docker-compose.yml file like this:
version: &#x27;3&#x27;
services:
    server:
        image: 
        ports:
            - &quot;80:80&quot;
        tty: true
        expose:
            - &quot;80&quot; 
        stdin_open: true
        environment:
            - MODE&#x3D;dev
        command: 

If we want to run a command when we run the image we can specify on command.
docker run -d -p 80:80  command

Hope you liked and also helps you in case you have to dockerize an angular app.</span>

                    <span>In this article, I‚Äôll go over (almost) everything noteworthy in this brand new release. I‚Äôll also highlight what‚Äôs changed around Angular, just like I did with my previous articles about Angular 11 and Angular 10.
If you&#x27;re just looking for the bird-eye view, then check out the official release announcement. Here, I&#x27;ll dig much deeper into the release notes.
The Angular team has been working on Ivy (the new compilation &amp; rendering pipeline) since 2018. It was finally released with Angular 8. Since Angular 9, Ivy has been the default for new projects, and the ecosystem is slowly migrating to it. With Angular 12, the old View Engine is now officially deprecated. It will be removed in a future major release. Also, it won&#x27;t be possible to create new applications using View Engine. Finally, Ivy‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Overall idea behind this article to explain and demonstrate the usage of ControlValueAccessor and Validator interfaces . The former is used to bind together a FormControl from Forms package and native DOM elements. The latter is used to implement validation logic. They can exist independently of each other, but in this article we‚Äôll implement both using a single directive. Our directive will add the following functionality to the application:
Conversion between input value and control value
Validation for invalid date
If you‚Äôre using ControlValueAccessor for the first time, I would recommend going through this article first: Never again be confused when implementing ControlValueAccessor in Angular forms. 
We will first create a directive and handle conversion between UI and control value.

                    <span>Step 1 - Install dependency
npm i ng-recaptcha --save

Step -2 Open app.module.ts and add below import-
import { RecaptchaModule } from &#x27;ng-recaptcha&#x27;;

Also add this to imports -
imports: [RecaptchaModule,],

Step 3 - Open that component where you want to add human verification reCAPTCHA and then add below code -

yourcomponentname.component.html
 

yourcomponentname.component.ts
public resolved(captchaResponse: string) { 
console.log(&#x60;Resolved captcha with response: ${captchaResponse}&#x60;); // Write your logic here about once human verified what action you want to perform 
}

Step 5 - This siteKey will work on localhost, you must have to generate your own siteKey, for this please visit google.com/recaptcha and add your domain and generate key, it&#x27;s very simple and then replace the new key to markup of step3.  
All done.</span>

                    <span>So you&#x27;ve coded an awesome app and you are ready to deploy it to the cloud. You&#x27;ve heard a lot about Docker and completed a few online tutorials to containerise your app. All set, right? But what do you need to know if you&#x27;re going to move that app to a production environment on the public Internet? What if you&#x27;re using it for your job and need to pass security scans and DevOps checks?
In this series, I introduce some basic concepts for making production ready containers. I also introduce the concept of &quot;slimming&quot; a container. Slimming refers to both optimising and minifying your Docker containers, reducing them in size by up to 80-percent while also making them more secure by decreasing the attack surface. Slimming your container is also a great way to implement container best practices w‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>An array is a common data structure that holds items of the same type, in Typescript, unlike other languages, an array doesn&#x27;t have a fixed length. Also, in Typescript, you don&#x27;t have to re-organize all elements of an array when makings operations like insert or delete.

Elements are the items stored in an array
Index is the location of an element in an array, it goes from 0 to (array length - 1)




/** An array can be written like this **/

const numbers: number[] &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4]
const names &#x3D; string[] &#x3D; [&#x27;Snake&#x27;, &#x27;Ocelot&#x27;, &#x27;Otacon&#x27;, &#x27;Naomi&#x27;]

/** Also can be written using a generic array type, Array **/

let list: Array &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4]
let list: Array &#x3D; [&#x27;Snake&#x27;, &#x27;Ocelot&#x27;, &#x27;Otacon&#x27;, &#x27;Naomi&#x27;]

Traverse - Print all array items one by one
/** 3 ways to iterate an array **/

for(let i&#x3D;0; i {
    console.log(item)
})

Insertion - Add an item
/** add to the end **/
array.push(5)

/** add to the beginning **/
array.unshift(0)

/** add in a specific index position **/
array.splice(3, 0, 8) // add 8 in the index 3

Deletion - Remove an item
/** remove from the end **/
array.pop()

/** remove from the beginning **/
array.shift()

/** remove from a specific index position **/
array.splice(2, 1) // remove from index 2

Update - Update an item
/** update element in position 1 **/
array[1] &#x3D; 7

Search - Search by an item
/** you can traverse an array to find an element by its value, or simply use the .find() function **/

const item &#x3D; array.find(item &#x3D;&gt; item &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 3) // search by an item with value 3

All above operations can be performed on strings to solve problems like count the occurrences of a character in a string:
let str &#x3D; &quot;aabbccdd&quot;
let occurrences &#x3D; 0

for(let i&#x3D;0; i &lt; str.length; i++) {
    if(str[i] &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;c&quot;) {
        occurrences++
    }
}

console.log(occurrences) // prints 2</span>

Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

Docker Engine Must be Installed in the Base OS / Host .
To confirm whether docker is installed or not we can use :
Docker Engine must be in running state .
[root@os]~# systemctl status docker

We must have a docker image to execute our task .
[root@os]~# docker pull centos:latest
We will now create a Dockerfile in which we will specify our Requirements for our own custom Image
[root@os]~# vim Dockerfile 
FROM centos:latest

[root@os]~# docker build -t firefox:v1 .

docker build will help us to make our own customized image with tag firefox:v1

[root@os]~# docker run -it --name task2 -e DISPLAY&#x3D;$DISPLAY --net&#x3D;host firefox:v1

$DISPLAY &#x3D;&#x3D; Enivornment Variable for our Display :0 is the main display.
[root@os]~# firefox

[root@os]~# jupyter notebook

In Addition to firefox i used jupyter notebook as a GUI APP.

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>
