                    <span>I found the linux command line quite intimidating when I first started learning to code. It seemed to require extensive and comprehensive knowledge and understanding of commands and keyboard shortcuts. However, as I read more about it and practiced what I learned, I realized that it isn&#x27;t as scary as it seemed; that It only requires a lot of constant practice. I also discovered that others feel the same way, which made me realise that I wasn&#x27;t alone.
The other thing I discovered during this period is that we are all beginners and sharing is helpful, since no one is an island. So I decided to share my experience with others starting out as well. As we all know, learning is never-ending. There will always be new tools and new commands to learn, especially when you&#x27;re a beginner. The followin‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Expectation for software reliability and availability is at an all-time high now. With money and prestige on the line, every application and website wants to avoid downtime while building new things as fast as possible. However, perfect infrastructure or perfect software does not exist, so incidents do happen. 
What we can do is minimizing the impact by making sure we are responding quickly and efficiently. This makes on-call rotations a part of our lives now.
If structured and compensated correctly, on-call rotations can improve the overall quality and the response time for incidents quite a lot. However, it is not always a positive experience to be on call. One reason for an unpleasant on-call is getting many alerts.

                    <span>Introduction


I was asked at work recently by someone completely new to DevOps and coding in general - &quot;Why would you use Terraform? It is so much easier to do things in the portal.&quot;
Today, we will be exploring my personal favourite feature of Terraform - the fact it is declarative. 
Yes - I have ranked my favourite and most hated features of Terraform :).
This will be very beginner orientated. This is also a laying down some of the foundational concepts for the upcoming TERF series (Terraform Enterprise Ready Framework).
Terraform state on their website:
The Terraform language is declarative, describing an intended goal, rather than the steps to reach that goal. 
A common explanation on google searches:
A language which describes what needs to be done, instead of how to do it.

In a nutshell, Version Control System is a system that records changes to a file or a set of files over time and allows you to return later to a specific version of your project. It means that even if you or your co-worker made a mistake you can easily return to the latest version of your project and start from there again. It makes everything easier and gives you chances to experiment

                    <span>A Kubernetes service is a logical abstraction for a group of pods in a cluster (all performing the same function).
Since pods are ephemeral, a service enables a group of pods that provide certain functions (web services, image processing, etc.) to be assigned a name and a unique IP address (clusterIP). As long as the service uses this IP address, it does not change. Services also define policies for their access.
In Kubernetes, a deployment is a way to start a pod of containerized applications and ensure that the required number of replicas are always running on the cluster. 
A service, on the other hand, is responsible for exposing an interface to these pods which enables network access either within the cluster or between external processes and the service.

                    <span>Being developers, we get zoned out in those standup calls when the server admins take over and flaunt their container orchestration skills. Let&#x27;s take over and it&#x27;s our time to shine now.
We have been hearing a lot about containers and how they&#x27;ve been streamlining the way a development lifecycle works. Not getting deep into containers in this post, you can have a look into this. When our applications become bigger or if we are getting into making it modular, multiple containers come into play. Here&#x27;s where things get tricky. For example, if we are running an e-commerce application - our auth/login, payment services, product catalogues, inventory management will run as individual containers or services - this is the microservices approach.

Um pod nada mais √© do que o menor artefato poss√≠vel de implementa√ß√£o dentro de um cluster Kubernetes. √â nele que podemos subir um ou mais containers, compartilhando storage e recursos de rede.
Cada container em um pod executa no pr√≥prio cgroup, mas eles comparilham alguns namespaces.

So the first thing we need to do is update the existing packages currently present. To do that we need to run the following command in the terminal. This will make sure that you have the latest security patches updated in your instance.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

Now we will install NodeJs. We will install NodeJs using the apt package manager which is the default package manager for Ubuntu. We need to use the following command on the terminal to install the latest LTS version of NodeJs.
sudo apt install nodejs

Verify that node is installed using the below command

                    <span>For the dance game I&#x27;m making, I want players to be able to use any YouTube video and dance to it. To put it simply, they&#x27;ll paste a YouTube link into the game and it&#x27;ll analyze it for them and they&#x27;ll be able to dance to it, being scored in realtime as they dance along. (take a look at the previous blog posts if you need more context!)
I don&#x27;t want to embed YouTube videos in my game. There&#x27;s a few reasons for this:
TensorFlow.js (the machine learning platform that I&#x27;m using) can&#x27;t analyze an embedded YouTube video. The video needs to be inside of an accessible  (or similar) element on the webpage and cannot be embedded.

For those who are fitness gurus like me, I never quite found an app that track everything in one app without the prescription fee. Even when it comes with a prescription fee, I still am not fully satisfied with what it entails. I have tried using a few different apps throughout the last few years like MyFitnessPal, the apple watch health and even Kayla Itsines &quot;Sweat&quot; app. But in the end, fitness is really about having a truly healthy lifestyle and not just working out. 
Food: cooking, baking, meal prepping 
Athletics: Tracking Calories, progress, workouts 
lifestyle: motivation and a safe community
What you eat is just as important as how you exercise. Meaning that you have to track what you eat no matter what your goals are. I want this app to give people ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>One thing to look out for in Node.js: functions that may throw an error either synchronously or asynchronously (which, technically, is any function that does async work). You may think you&#x27;ve got pretty good error-handling, but they complicate things.
For instance, here&#x27;s a basic example:
function getAdditionalData(input) {
  const url &#x3D; getRequestUrl(input);

  return makeHttprequest(url).then(response &#x3D;&gt; {
    return response.data;
  });
}

app.get(&#x27;/data&#x27;, (req, res) &#x3D;&gt; {
  const input &#x3D; calculateInput();
  return getAdditionalData(input).then(result &#x3D;&gt; {
    return { input, result };
  });
});

This is a simple endpoint that calls getAdditionalData() to get some data and return to the user. The function does an asynchronous thing (HTTP request), so it returns a promise.

During this short period of my career, I got the opportunity to work with several technologies. As I‚Äôm working as a Full-Stack dev so previously I had hands-on experience with Laravel, React, Vue, Mysql other related techs. I was very excited when my company assigned me to a MERN stack app. That was a huge transition.

Sometimes when building an application, we think the only to make it secure means to avoid hackers attack and this is not a development job, is something related to operations job. Let&#x27;s talk the true here (secure env). Which words come on your mind when you think about security? Password and Hackers (right?).

                    <span>Docker Tips - UFW


By default docker will override the &quot;Uncomplicated Firewall&quot; (UFW) rules, it is important to be aware of this so that you do not accidentally expose your docker containers to the world.
If you had UFW configured to block port 3000, then you would be forgiven for assuming our docker app would also be blocked.
docker run -d -p 3000:5000 training/webapp python app.py
However, docker adds rules to IP tables directly. This bypasses UFW which causes our app to be exposed to the world.
The problem is that our port mapping tag exposes our app:
-p 3000:5000
Restricting access to localhost is a simple change:
-p 127.0.0.1:3000:5000
This binds port 5000 inside the container to port 3000 on the localhost or 127.0.0.1 interface on the host machine.
Our app is now blocked from external traffic!
GCP, AWS and even OVH all have external firewalls that sit infront of the server. Leveraging cloud based firewalls in addition to UFW is the best way to solve the issue.</span>

                    <span>FastAPI : a great framework for creating APIs, it takes very small effort to realize how fast it is in comparison with other frameworks like Flask, Pyramid, bottle, tornado and Django.
Developers are switching from Flask to FastAPI for a lot of reasons like speed, for instance.
This is techempower.com, an independent website that benchmarks web servers by running a variety of tests on them, FastAPI (with Uvicorn, the ASGI server implementation) is one of the fastest web servers.

And why I prefer FastAPI over others Fws is because of its high performance, ease of syntax, you have something like Pydantic that allows modern python typing, also asynchronous requests with Async/Await syntax .. and no wonder that FastAPI is on par with Go language and Node JS (which is built on the V8 engine, the same engine of Google Chrome)
Take a look at my latest video on the channel where you can learn how to build user authentication with web based tokens using JWTs ( pronounce Jots) or JSON Web Tokens; and how this is better than the traditional cookie based sessions

                    <span>What is scrollspy?


Scrollspy is a mechanism that highlights an active menu item based on current scroll position to indicate which section is currently visible in the viewport. It&#x27;s available in Bootstrap (see the docs), but right now let&#x27;s implement it from scratch using React and TypeScript.
Before we start, let&#x27;s add some helper functions that we will use for computations in our hook. Also, this way we keep logic separated and make our code look cleaner.
// Restrict value to be between the range [0, value]
const clamp &#x3D; (value: number) &#x3D;&gt; Math.max(0, value);

// Check if number is between two values
const isBetween &#x3D; (value: number, floor: number, ceil: number) &#x3D;&gt;
  value &gt;&#x3D; floor &amp;&amp; value &lt;&#x3D; ceil;

Once we&#x27;re ready with helpers, we can jump to the hook code.

                    <span>Alright lads, this will be a quick one. I want to add the views count functionality on my personal portfolio website&#x27;s blog section.

Expected behavior:
  Blogs Page : List of blogs -&gt; Show count.
 Blog Page : Particular Article -&gt; Show count and  Increment count.
How to achieve:
Use supabase to store count by slug
Stored procedure to increment count
Tools that I&#x27;ll need:
supabase : open source firebase alternative 
swr : data fetching
Create a table views with schema like such:
slug -&gt; text -&gt; primary key
created_at -&gt; timestamp -&gt; now()
count -&gt;  int2 
count:



Fetch count
Increment one
Fetch count again
Now we can reduce this to one db call using stored procedures:

create function increment (slug_text text)
returns void as
$$
update views
set count &#x3D; count + 1
where slug &#x3D; slug_text;

                    <span>Intro


When I receive or send data between client side and server side in TypeScript, I convert data to JSON.
Node.js ver.17.0.1
TypeScript 4.4.4
I can convert string values by &quot;TextDecoder&quot; and &quot;TextEncoder&quot;.
export function init(): void {
    const originalText &#x3D; &quot;„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ&quot;;
    const textBuffer &#x3D; convertFromStringToBuffer(originalText);
    console.log(textBuffer);
    const convertedText &#x3D; convertFromBufferToString(textBuffer);
    console.log(convertedText);
}
function convertFromStringToBuffer(value: string): ArrayBuffer {
    // Encode with UTF-8
    const encoder &#x3D; new TextEncoder();
    return encoder.encode(value);
}
function convertFromBufferToString(value: ArrayBuffer): string {
    // Decode with UTF-8
    const decoder &#x3D; new TextDecoder();
    return decoder.decode(value);
}

                    <span>So, I&#x27;ve decided to release my source code on github for my Fireblog.io fully functional blog written in Angular, using Firestore as the database, and hosted on Cloud Run.
--- scroll down for screenshots, or Fireblog.io ---
I was originally hosted on Firebase Functions, but I wanted it to be a little bit faster, and the ng deploy to Firebase Functions also stopped working as expected. In fact, I wonder what the Angular Firebase Team is doing at all these days. The documentation for Angular Firebase 9 is still not up-to-date, and it seems like they are behind on updating to Angular 13 (to be fair, it has only been a few days at this point).
Before I get into anything, I have to recommend you check out Fireship.io, as it is the reason I have become proficient in these technologies.

                    <span>In Angular, we use HTTP to get data from backend,HTTP methods always return an observable.Generally we subscribe to that observable and assign response data to class variables to use it in our component.
But using RxJS operators we can compose multiple observables(data streams) or process  observable data  before subscribing to it.
RxJS concatMap operator
Observable emits observable).
concatMap operator
Takes each value from the outer observable and maps that value  to observable(called as inner observable) 
Concat all inner observables into a single observable in order  and subscribe to inner observables and emit data of each inner observable into output observable in sequential manner.
concatMap never subscribes to the next inner observable until the previous one completes.
Example:

Run live
Here we have 2 API‚Äôs
In the above case we need to take all roll numbers from the first API  and pass it to the second API.

So solution to this problem is use concatMap RxJS operator instead of nested subscription.

First contactMap operator -
getToppers_rollNum() this method returns an Observable of type number[] , conactMap  maps Observable to Observable (inner observable) then subscribes to inner observable and emit data into output observable(top_3_rollNum$).
Second  concatMap operator -
top_3_rollNum$ as outer observable.concatMap takes each roll number from the outer observable and hits http request sequentially(here we have 3 inner observables return by 3 http requests) &amp; emits http response data into output observable(topper_marks$).
concatMap never hits the next http request until the previous one completes.
Shorthand syntax for above code

So,concatMap is used where sequence of execution matters.

Nx Devtools recently released version 13.1, which came with a very handy generator for Angular libraries, which creates secondary entrypoints for your Angular Libraries with ease. In this blog post we will cover why and how we should make use of this new function.
By adding secondary entrypoints, we basically split our Angular libraries into multiple chunks, just like Angular Material does.
// One entrypoint: 
import { MatButtonModule, MatCardModule } from &#x27;@angular/material&#x27;;

// With secondary entrypoints:
import { MatButtonModule } from &#x27;@angular/material/button&#x27;;
import { MatCardModule } from &#x27;@angular/material/card&#x27;;

In this article, let us learn about how we can render dynamic content to the client (which is not static). Let us first touch briefly on what a template engine is because rendering dynamic content is closely related to what a template engine will help us in achieving. 

A template engine is software designed to combine templates with a data model to produce multiple pages that share the same look throughout the site. These are the views in an MVC project.
So this helps us in putting dynamic content on our HTML pages. 
We got a HTML like template (technically not HTML) which is typically a file that contains a lot of HTML like content in it but with some placeholders plugged into it and then we have a server (a Node.js Express server or any other server) serving the Node/‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>In Angular, we use HTTP to get data from backend,HTTP methods always return an observable.Generally we subscribe to that observable and assign response data to class variables to use it in our component.
But using RxJS operators we can compose multiple observables(data streams) or process  observable data  before subscribing to it.
RxJS concatMap operator
Observable emits observable).
concatMap operator
Takes each value from the outer observable and maps that value  to observable(called as inner observable) 
Concat all inner observables into a single observable in order  and subscribe to inner observables and emit data of each inner observable into output observable in sequential manner.
concatMap never subscribes to the next inner observable until the previous one completes.
Example:

Run live
Here we have 2 API‚Äôs
In the above case we need to take all roll numbers from the first API  and pass it to the second API.

So solution to this problem is use concatMap RxJS operator instead of nested subscription.

First contactMap operator -
getToppers_rollNum() this method returns an Observable of type number[] , conactMap  maps Observable to Observable (inner observable) then subscribes to inner observable and emit data into output observable(top_3_rollNum$).
Second  concatMap operator -
top_3_rollNum$ as outer observable.concatMap takes each roll number from the outer observable and hits http request sequentially(here we have 3 inner observables return by 3 http requests) &amp; emits http response data into output observable(topper_marks$).
concatMap never hits the next http request until the previous one completes.
Shorthand syntax for above code

So,concatMap is used where sequence of execution matters.

                    <span>I use NestJS at my day job. It‚Äôs a complicated framework sometimes and there are lots of things that devs ‚Äújust have to remember‚Äù or there will be bugs in your application that you won‚Äôt see until runtime.
I wanted to remove this cognative load from NestJS engineers so that they can focus on valuable work instead. I wrote an ESLint plugin to alert developers directly in their IDE or editor when these common issues exist - (Available on NPM) https://www.npmjs.com/package/@darraghor/eslint-plugin-nestjs-typed
Here is what I learned about writing ESLint plugins in typescript for typescript while building the plugin.
ESlint is the default linting tool in the JavaScript ( E CMA S cript) ecosystem. It is a command line tool but there are integrations with all popular IDEs and text editors.

                    <span>Originally posted here!
To convert an entire object to a read-only or a constant object, you can use the as keyword after the object initialization followed by the keyword const in TypeScript.
// using &quot;as&quot; keyword after the person
// object initialisation followed by the keyword &quot;const&quot;
// to make the object readonly or a constant object
const person &#x3D; {
  name: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
  age: 23,
} as const;

// change the &quot;name&quot; property value
person.name &#x3D; &quot;Hello&quot;; // ‚ùå not allowed. Cannot assign to &#x27;name&#x27; because it is a read-only property.

For example, let&#x27; say we have an object called person with 2 properties called name and age having values of John Doe and 23 respectively like this,
// a simple object
const person &#x3D; {
  name: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
  age: 23,
};

In case you are reading for the first time, I am Habdul Hazeez, and the author of this weekly series of articles where we review some security news that is worthy of your time. This has been the case for over a year now.
Do you like what I do? You can buy me a Coffee.
Moving on.
This week&#x27;s review is about malware, vulnerabilities, hacking, and social engineering. The latter resulted in someone losing half a million dollars.
Let&#x27;s get on with it.

                    <span>Very recently, AWS announced Vault Lock for AWS backup. This new feature enables the protection of backups from accidental or malicious actions.  Behind the scenes, this extra safeguard is made possible by storing backups using a Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) model. 
The main reason to rehash this? Unique features like this seem to stay under the radar way too often. Secondly, if you already use AWS Backup, then enabling this extra protection is almost effortless.
Here&#x27;s an example of AWS Backup Vault using Locks in CloudFormation:
  SomeBackupVault:
    Type: AWS::Backup::BackupVault
    DeletionPolicy: Retain

You know all about phishing. From time to time, emails purporting to be from Facebook or your bank drift into your inbox and insist you ‚Äúverify your account.‚Äù Look closer and you spot the telltale signs of a scam: a sketchy-looking sender address, sloppy writing, and a complete lack of personalization. You sigh and hit delete.
It‚Äôs easy to be cynical about opportunistic, mass-mailed phishing attempts. Although some look genuine to even the most cautious eye, others feel decidedly amateurish and are readily identifiable. Billions of emails are sent each month, with over 245,000 phishing-related websites created in January alone according to the Anti-Phish‚Ä¶</span>

Once you sign up for PropelAuth, you immediately have your own authentication service. This includes a lot behind the scenes, but to your end-users, the first thing they will see is this

You can brand your site easily by supplying your product&#x27;s colors and a logo. This branding applies not only to all your auth pages, but also to any emails that we send (forgotten passwords, email confirmations, user invites, etc.).

Also, this branding includes the URL your customers are on. We support custom domains so your users see your auth pages on https://auth.yourdomain.com, not https://yourname.propelauth.com.

The other day, I started writing mock of localStorage in TypeScript.
Regarding this code, please note that it does not behave completely the same as localStorage.
The behavior is not perfectly reproduced (The value returned when an unintended value is passed, for example), but the basic logic is implemented.

class LocalStorageMock {

  constructor() {
    this.store &#x3D; {};

backend server[

        template springboot(tests fabut)

We are starting with the definition of User and Todo #models, with a few fields and Todo Status #enums.

One of the first things we did when we got our laptops was set up our BIOS. 
This post will give a brief description of what BIOS is, how to navigate to it, and some of the common settings you might change. 
BIOS or Basic Input/Output System is a small piece of code that lives in a ‚Äúread only‚Äù chip on your system board(motherboard).

Role-Based Access Control, also known as RBAC, is one of the most common strategies to restrict access to protected resources within an organization. It simplifies permission assignment by categorizing users in roles. However, many people making their first foray into RBAC have questions:
How can you reflect this user categorization on your application to check users&#x27; privileges?
How can you deal with roles in your code?
Is role control appropriate for Web APIs?
In this article, you will learn the best way to implement RBAC in your ASP.NET Core Web API by using Auth0&#x27;s capabilities.

                    <span>When we start using Linux, one of the first doubts is how to install our favorite applications. As developers, we need several tools, one of the most common is Node.js and NPM. Let&#x27;s see what is Node.js, NPM and how to install them in Linux.


  
  
  What is Node JS?


Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js is a popular, lightweight web framework for beginners, and it is used by many big companies like Netflix and Uber.


  
  
  What is NPM?


NPM is the default package manager for Node.js projects. NPM includes a command-line tool (CLI) that give you access to the NPM package registry. The registry stores the numerous JavaScript packages made available through the NPM CLI, along with their‚Ä¶</span>

First, we must install python3 and pip, together with some other dependencies:
$ sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
$ pip3 install distro jsonschema PyYAML

Then install kas; I had a problem with a dependency so I had to install another package by hand
$ pip3 install testresources
$ pip3 install kas

As an example, we can try to build a simple image for the qemu machine which is already contained in the poky
kas-project.yml, which will describe how our distribution must be built
$ mkdir kas-pine64
$ touch kas-project.yml

Add the following snippet to the project configuration file:
