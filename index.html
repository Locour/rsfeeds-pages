Now what is node: Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.

npm install -g npm@latest

If you want to check for updated versions you can do:
npm outdated

In order to update a specific package:
npm update &lt;package name&gt;

This will update the package to the latest version according to the restrictions in package.json
In case you also want to lock the updated version in package.json:
npm update &lt;package name&gt; --save


With all that being said, I highly recommend you keep learning!

Here comes Git-flow. Git-flow is a git workflow you can use to streamline your use of version control for your whole application. In today's post, I'll go over the basics of Git-flow and how it can improve you…</span>

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.
A very basic Dockerfile will look like
# Use an existing docker image as a base
FROM alpine


# Download and install the dependency
RUN apk add --update redis


# Tell the image what to do when it starts as a container
CMD ["redis-server"]

It generally have 3 steps :

                      <span>Terraform relies heavily on the concept of providers, a base brick which consists of Go plugins enabling the communication with an API.
Each provider gives access to one or more resource types, and these resources then manage objects on the target API.
Most of the time, a provider's configuration is static, e.g.
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

However, in some cases, it is useful to configure a provider dynamically, using the attribute values from other resources as input for the provider's confi…</span>

Thus, learning Kubernetes is oftentimes considered as cumbersome and complex, namely because of the number of new concepts you have to learn. On the other hand, those very same concepts can be found in other orchestrators. As a result, mastering them will ease your on…</span>

The technique which is most flexible and offers us the greatest amount of control is a simple for loop.

 DESIGN: 

Starting off number one is Design
PRIVACY AND DATA CONTROL:

It seems to me that the biggest Flaw that many people point to on Windows 10 is Privacy and Data control and also the forced updates, especially combined with poor quality control on those updates. You probably have heard that windows 10 "spy" on you and collects all sorts of information. Even if its a rumor but it will affect us.

                      <span>There is an idea that every developer should master tons of sophisticated tools and keyboard shortcuts to be truly professional and efficient. 
My experience doesn't confirm it. As an example, let me show you my command line setup. I'm not a sysadmin, but as a full stack developer with 10+ years of experience I use the terminal on a daily basis yet I've got a very basic setup:
No tmux
No aliases
No special .dotfile configs
No shell preference. I'm fine with zsh, bash, ksh, etc

                      <span>Hello there!!1 
how to add the port 8080/tcp in my system and list all the active ports in a text file called "zones.txt". I use a Linux Mint 20.1 XFCE system and I came across the apt-package named Uncomplicated Firewall. This package allows you to open ports on your system and makes them ready for use using ssh. 
Here is a screenshot on how to progress with the procedures.

I am also attaching my GitHub gist which provides an detailed explanation on how to implement this in your system.

                      <span>Are you stuck in vim and cannot exit? 
Vim is a powerful text editor, but if you are new to vim it may seem very confusing.
Personally I use the command ZZ to exit. This saves the file and exists. I use this all the time because what is simpler than pressing Z twice?
Vim works using commands. Before you enter a command, hit the Esc key. 
You can exit without saving your changes with :q!. This is useful if you accidentally modified a file you didn't want to.

In the previous post we talked about what is TypeScript and why should we use that. Now it's time to go to practice.
We need to know how to start using TypeScript in our JavaScript project. In examples of this post series, I will use mostly code that written in Node environment. It won't be any specific code that is understandable for only developers who worked with Node before. Because this material is about TypeScript I want to specify more on TypeScript itself.

Reactive sub-forms implemented with independent, highly re-usable Angular Components
This article was inspired by a recent discussion with a manager regarding how to integrate someone with a math/Aerospace Engineering background (that would be me) into a group that worked on heavily form-based applications.

I made this project as close as I could to the real Spotify. My goal was to make my app indistinguishable from the real version. I've had to copy some css but it allowed me to understand how to do certain tricks and how complex the real app was.
