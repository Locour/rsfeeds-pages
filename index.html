Let&#x27;s start from a very simple pipeline definition:
trigger:
- main

pool:

steps:
- checkout: self

- script: dir $(Build.SourcesDirectory)

Nothing much to see here, just a pipeline that uses it&#x27;s own repo and prints out the content after checkout

Se pensarmos em frameworks e sua curva de aprendizado, podemos dizer que Vue é um framework relativamente fácil de aprender, seguido de ReactJS (que tecnicamente é uma lib), e depois vem o Angular. Então por que eu aprenderia Angular e não outro framework?
Angular é um framework bem completinho. Ele vem com algumas bibliotecas já incluídas, como router e http, por exemplo. Ele tem Typescript integrado, mas você não precisa escrever em Typescript se não quiser. …</span>

                    <span>Every developer aims to create internet apps and websites that scale well and have Fort Knox-level security. And each consumer requires the use of such a product. As a result, selecting the most appropriate and dependable technologies for your projects is critical. Both Angular and PHP have applied sciences, and thus this can create confusion as to what can be the best option for developers to choose from in 2021.
So, before we move to compare them, let us first understand what PHP and Angular are.
Angular is an open-source framework that is TypeScript based and used to build applications for desktops and websites.
The Angular project was directed by the Angular Team at Google and built with the aid of a large community of businesses and individuals. Angular is also known as “Angular 2+” o…</span>

                    <span>For SSR and node.js usage of Angular, we may need to have a Promise complete before the page is loaded. This is especially true when we need to create meta tags for SEO. Yes, our app is slower, but we have to get it indexable.
Every wonder why your meta tags seem to work sometimes, but not other times? It is because ngOnInit is NOT an async function, even with async, neither is a constructor which must return this, and neither is an async pipe in your template. Sometimes the fetches return on time, other times they don&#x27;t. So, I added this post:
ngOnInit does NOT wait for the promise to complete. You can make it an async function if you feel like using await like so:
import { take } from &#x27;rxjs/operators&#x27;;

async ngOnInit(): Promise {

Ok, here you are, you are looking to read data from one place and present that as a web report. The data is remote, you need to fetch it somehow, you also probably need to think about how to convert the incoming data and lastly create that web report. If you are a developer, you probably think that oh ok, this is probably a few moving parts, 10-20 lines of code. But you&#x27;ve heard of PowerShell, it&#x27;s supposed to be powerful, do a lot of heavy lifting, so why not give it a spin.

                    <span>Pull requests


In software engineering, a pull request is the process in which a contributor asks a repository owner to merge their changes into the main codebase. 
The PR is important, as it acts as a crucial safety buffer when developing software. It gives a chance for both manual validation (e.g. code reviews) and automatic checks (e.g. unit tests) to take place, as well as discussions between the repository&#x27;s maintainers.
Once the code has been approved, it can be assumed safe to merge in, and will eventually become part of the next release. 
This safeguard should result in the main branch of code remaining in a production-ready state, all of the time.
When looking at a pull request, the reviewer is addressing two concerns:
Is the code of a high quality?

Application performance monitoring is the process of keeping your app&#x27;s health in check. APM tools enable you to be proactive about meeting the demands of your customers.
If you&#x27;re comparing DataDog and Jaeger, distributed tracing capabilities of both tools is one of the important criterion. Before we dive in, let&#x27;s first understand in brief what is distributed tracing.

                    <span>Long gone are the days when apps could only use a single system font, bold and italic at most, and that was it. Typography is now a significant part of product identity, but how do you apply it systematically?
As with colors, the most important thing is to avoid hardcoding type-specific values in the design tool and in the code. This means that you need to define a set of text styles and use them consistently wherever text appears in your UI.
Both major mobile platforms provide default text styles for different situations such as headings, subheadings, paragraphs, captions, or labels. However, these styles don&#x27;t match across platforms, and it&#x27;s also likely that your product needs won&#x27;t fit neatly into these preset categories. In that case, rather than combining built-in and custom styles, …</span>

                    <span>Diffusion™ 6.3 introduced topic views, a mechanism to produce virtual topics (known as reference topics) that refer to other topics in the topic tree for their value. In 6.4, we added topic view expansion, enabling a single source topic to be expanded to produce many derived reference topics. In Diffusion 6.5, the concepts of fan-out and topic views were combined to allow remote topic views to specify source topics at another server.

Summary
Topic view inserts introduce powerful new functionality into the ever-developing language of topic views.

                    <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m Dustin, and today I want to talk about the experience of adding new feature for a static site generator written by Vivian.
A SSG is a command line tool that helps users to convert .txt files or .md files into .html files. 
This project is quite fun and offers me a bunch of new knowledge.
First off, I created an issue mentioning about what I wanted to improve in on her code. I listed all the necessary tasks to be done and sent the issue. After she accepted and assigned me to the issue, I started to write code right away and created a pull request for the code I wrote. It&#x27;s actually not a big deal for me at all because her code was pretty clean and understandable. Although she requested a few changes in my code, everything went well and my pull request got merged right after that.
Same thing happens in my code I guess because we had no trouble understanding each other&#x27;s code. The process was quite straight forward, she filed an issue -&gt; I accepted it -&gt; she coded it -&gt; I requested some changes as she added some extra lines that were not necessary. However, there was one thing I had to do which is pulling her code into my machine so that I could test it out. While testing her code, I just realized that I had a quite big bug in my code that I didn&#x27;t know about. However, her issue was just for the new feature about config file, so I decided to create another issue about the bug I mentioned above and resolved it after her code got merged.

                    <span>What CRUD API means ?


The CRUD paradigm stands for the four primitive database operations that  are CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE.
So, with the term CRUD API we mean, the API which have the ability to create, read, update and delete entities from a database. For this example, the entity is the employee.
API Endpoints are the following



Methods
Urls
Description




GET
api/employees
Get all employees


GET
api/employees/id
Get a specific employee


POST
api/employees
Create a new employee


PUT
api/employees/id
Update an existing employee


DELETE
api/employees/id
Delete an existing employee



We create the repository and install the dependencies.
The entry point is the server.js file.

                    <span>As mentioned in our previous article, Medusa is participating in Hacktoberfest for the first time this year and the excitement is high. 
There are loads of issues out there for developers to pick up, but it&#x27;s not always easy to figure out where to start. We&#x27;ve made a series of good first issues that includes both a video tutorial and a checklist, such that you can easily get started building in public.
The issues chosen for the series deal with API fixture generation. Currently, our fixtures are all stored within the same file, which is suboptimal due to 1) loading large files on the client (our API reference) is bad for performance and user experience and 2) referencing a single fixture in such a large file requires us to look for a needle in a haystack. 
The goal is to split each fixture into their own dedicated file making them lightweight and easy to reference.
The issues can be found filtering on label api-fixture, or use this link for easy access.
To easily get started use the following checklist:
checkout docs/api

branch out to docs/api-[ns]-[endpoint]

if necessary clear dist and run yarn bootstrap

cd integration-tests/docs

yarn &amp;&amp; yarn build
medusa-dev --scan-once
Open __tests__/[ns].js

Import from ../test-input/[ns]/[endpoint]

Add test to the toTest array
yarn test --watch __tests__/[ns].js -t [operationId]
Make changes
Make sure that snapshots are correctly defined so that tests pass across two runs
Only add the fixtures and test changes related to your generated fixtures
Push and open PR against docs/api



Additionally, you can watch this video tutorial 
If you encounter issues, reach out to the community on Discord or submit them to our Github issue board.</span>

                    <span>Introducing Messageraft  🎉. A single API that can be used to dispatch email, SMS, and chat-based notifications all from a single interface.
Since I sold my startup, I have been left with a void that my creative mind was looking for ways to fill.
One of the ideas that I kept coming back to prior to selling my startup was a notification gateway as a service. I went ahead and scratched my itch and MessageRaft is the result of that.
Let&#x27;s get some things out of the way first.
A notifications gateway as the name implies is a portal where notifications pass through. In layman terms, it&#x27;s basically a server that has an API exposed to other services/apps and receives requests.
And you guess it, notification requests. Simply put, it is a single API that can process multiple types of notifications and dispatch accordingly.
While it is still in its infancy, it is fully functional, the core is open-source hence it is free to use and you can get started in under 2 minutes (your internet connection and computer is the only bottleneck on that!!!)
So, without further ado, I have built and released a CLI which you can use to get started here
Messageraft is going to be 100% build in public and its core will always be free. I am looking to see if it picks traction and if it does I plan to create a product around it for people who don&#x27;t want to host the service themselves plus a magnitude more providers support.
In addition, I have recently released a helper tool that makes it even easier and faster to develop and test emails locally from your machine with the help of MessageRaft which I am going to cover in another article so stay tuned for that!
This is the first time I am building in public and would appreciate any type of feedback you can provide. As always you can find me on twitter</span>

For this very reason, it is used in the development of high-performance and fast apps. To create smooth and effective Node Js apps, you must use the best IDEs and development tools. So I have composed a list of the best IDEs for Node.js app development in this blog.
1. Visual Studio Code
This IDE is considered the best by many people. It is transparent to use but the code editor is robust that you can download and use for free.

Are you sure you are ensuring your code to be used as intended? Are you preventing it from beeing used in a malicious way?
If what comes your way is putting guards in your functions, this post will open up a world for you as this one was for me. Using checks is not enough.
You will be both wolf and sheep. I created the function below so that it had everything you need to learn attack and related defenses from the techniques:
Probing &amp; Double Getter
Prototype Bribing
Primitive Illusion
The function is Connector, which receives an options configuration object. This must contain a property named address which must be the same as one of those listed in validAddresses, otherwise an exception is thrown.

                    <span>Summary


One of the great benefits of Doppler is keeping your project in sync. We want to be able to sync our app wherever we develop and deploy. It only takes a few minutes to integrate the Vercel marketplace with Doppler, and that is what we will be doing in this tutorial
In this tutorial we will learn how to install the Doppler integration from Vercel’s new marketplace. Learn how to sync the secrets in your doppler project for deployment.
The first thing we want to do is to login to our doppler account. I won’t be touching the details of creating an account and login into doppler, because I have already done an introduction to doppler in a previous post. So once we have logged into Doppler, we head over to Vercel and add our project we want to integerate doppler with.

                    <span>Running an e-commerce website is hard enough, and dealing with security threats is among the major challenges to address in 2021. As the COVID-19 pandemic pushed customers towards e-commerce, its share of total retail sales has been significantly increased since 2020 and is expected to grow in the coming years. With e-commerce being on the rise, fraudsters are hot on the track of online shopping businesses and their customers. 
According to a Juniper research report, e-commerce retailers are at risk of losing over $20 billion in 2021 due to online fraudulent activities. This represents an 18% increase, compared to $17.5 billion recorded last year. Thus, it’s essential to be aware of security aspects to be able to prevent security breaches.

                    <span>Hi Dev.To! This article will explain how to integrate forms with Notion with Commotion.Page. With Commotion, you can create forms that you can embed in Notion pages and that save results into a Notion database, so you never need to leave the platform. Here&#x27;s how you get started.
This one is fairly straightforward. Go into your Notion workspace and create a Notion database like below.

Head over to Commotion.page and sign up for an account. It&#x27;s a freemium service, so sign up and check it out for free for as long as you like and upgrade to Pro only when you want!
You&#x27;ll need to connect your Notion account in order to create forms with Commotion. Don&#x27;t worry, Notion has a super easy flow, so just press the connect button, select which pages you want to create forms for, and hit allow access.…</span>

When to use declarative code
Conclusion
Functional Programming is a declarative programming paradigm, in contrast to imperative programming paradigms.
Declarative programming is a paradigm describing WHAT the program does, without explicitly specifying its control flow.
Imperative programming is a paradigm describing HOW the program should do something by explicitly specifying each instruction (or statement) step by step, which mutate the program&#x27;s state.
This &quot;what vs how&quot; is often used to compare both of these approaches because... Well, it is actually a good way to describe them.
Granted, at the end of the day, everything compiles to instructions for the CPU. So in a way, declarative programming is a layer of abstra…</span>

  π\piπ

 (pi). The simple – yet genius – idea behind this concept just blew my mind. Calculating an infinite number like pi doesn&#x27;t sound like fun for most people. Still, seeing the number getting more and more precise continues to amaze me. In order to refresh some old memories, I decided to implement an interactive simulation in React and TypeScript.
Let me explain the idea behind the Monte Carlo Simulation with an analogy to rain. Take a sheet of paper and draw a unit square (whose sides have length 1) on it. Inside this unit square, draw a quarter circle with a radius of 1. It will look like this:

Now, let&#x27;s imagine it is raining on this unit square with perfect randomness. The raindrops…</span>

                    <span>Introducing Messageraft  🎉. A single API that can be used to dispatch email, SMS, and chat-based notifications all from a single interface.
Since I sold my startup, I have been left with a void that my creative mind was looking for ways to fill.
One of the ideas that I kept coming back to prior to selling my startup was a notification gateway as a service. I went ahead and scratched my itch and MessageRaft is the result of that.
Let&#x27;s get some things out of the way first.
A notifications gateway as the name implies is a portal where notifications pass through. In layman terms, it&#x27;s basically a server that has an API exposed to other services/apps and receives requests.
And you guess it, notification requests. Simply put, it is a single API that can process multiple types of notifications and dispatch accordingly.
While it is still in its infancy, it is fully functional, the core is open-source hence it is free to use and you can get started in under 2 minutes (your internet connection and computer is the only bottleneck on that!!!)
So, without further ado, I have built and released a CLI which you can use to get started here
Messageraft is going to be 100% build in public and its core will always be free. I am looking to see if it picks traction and if it does I plan to create a product around it for people who don&#x27;t want to host the service themselves plus a magnitude more providers support.
In addition, I have recently released a helper tool that makes it even easier and faster to develop and test emails locally from your machine with the help of MessageRaft which I am going to cover in another article so stay tuned for that!
This is the first time I am building in public and would appreciate any type of feedback you can provide. As always you can find me on twitter</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Lately, I&#x27;m learning React and its frameworks (like Next.js) and libraries. I even remake my personal site as my first portfolio in React. Just made it using Next.js and Chakra UI and integrated it to my Notion workspace.
To connect my web to my Notion workspace I used React Notion from Splitbee. You can check it for a while.
So, React Notion use Notion API Worker to handle its requests. It can be also self-hosted using Cloudflare. Cloudflare offers a generous free plan with up to 100,000 request per day.
I will not explain about React Notion details, you can check it alone by yourself. I&#x27;ll write about how to self-host the Notion API Worker using Cloudflare.
You can login to Cloudlfare worker site or register if you don&#x27;t have an account yet.
Before go further, you can fork and clone the Notion API Worker.
After you cloned it, install the dependencies using yarn.
Rename the file named wrangler.example.toml to wrangler.toml.
Edit wrangler.toml according to your preferences. Here&#x27;s also example of mine.




name &#x3D; [Your worker url]
webpack_config &#x3D; &quot;webpack.config.js&quot;
type &#x3D; &quot;webpack&quot;
workers_dev &#x3D; true
compatibility_date &#x3D; &quot;2021-10-07&quot;

account_id &#x3D; [Your Cloudflare account ID]
zone_id &#x3D; [Your Cloudflare zone_id]

route &#x3D; &quot;[Your domain]/*&quot;


Make sure you have installed wrangler. You can see how to install it here.
You can edit the scripts in package.json if you want so you can run it with your custom command.




  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;build&quot;: &quot;webpack&quot;,
    &quot;dev&quot;: &quot;wrangler dev&quot;,
    &quot;preview&quot;: &quot;wrangler preview&quot;,
    &quot;deploy&quot;: &quot;wrangler publish&quot;
  },

To run it locally, you can run yarn dev and open the link.


To see the preview you can run yarn preview.
The last thing, you can deploy it to Cloudflare server using yarn deploy or wrangler publish. Then open the link in your browser.




Tadaaaaa, it&#x27;s done. You can check your API worker in your Cloudflare dashboard. This is my first english article, LOL. I hope it can help and inspire you.</span>

                    <span>Number 1:  Readonly


Let’s start with a small example:
function sortNumbers(array: Array) {
  return array.sort((a, b) &#x3D;&gt; a - b)
}

Now look at the code below and look if everything looks good. Think about what the console output will be. I recommend taking some time and actually thinking about it!
const numbers &#x3D; [7, 3, 5];

const sortedNumbers &#x3D; sortNumbers(numbers);

console.log(sortedNumbers);
console.log(numbers)

The first output is pretty simple. It is [3, 5, 7].  But now listen. The second output is the same! And you might be asking: Why? I defined the array as const how can it be changed?.
Well, arrays and objects are quite special in JavaScript. If you pass them to a function it will pass the reference to the array or object which means it will mutate the original arr…</span>

TypeScript just turned 9 years old, and it’s more popular than it’s ever been. As a matter of fact – it’s close to becoming the de facto standard for most JavaScript projects being started today. But is it still the best choice in 2021?
In this article, we’ll look at some of TypeScript’s main benefits, and what alternatives are out there.
In order to look at how relevant TypeScript really is, we need to look at the main benefits we get from using it in our codebases. Here are some of the main upsides from going from .js to .ts:
Applying a type system to your codebase makes you much more confident your code will work. You can specify what kind of arguments are required, and enforce those constraints with near-instant compiler feedback. This makes it much easier …</span>

Foi uma oportunidade muito boa para mim já que ainda não tenho contato com o mercado de trabalho de tecnologia e estou em transição de carreira, e com certeza me ajudou a entender como o trabalho de um programador é, tendo uma equipe de devs, designers e metodologias ágeis como SCRUM.
Assim eu lhes apresento nosso projeto, o Orange Space!!!

                    <span>This article assumes you have knowledge about building React Components, Libraries, and Tailwind.
If you ever want to do a React component library with typescript and have a nice setup for your blanket project I will recommend Create React Library for sure! Alongside visually test your components using Storybook, this CLI allows you, out of the box,  to test your component in a real React project. Take a look at it for your next React Library Project.
Well this part is up to you, I usually pick styled system w/ styled components but to be honest then you have to write a lot a CSS (not too much tho), and if you need to move faster get around with extra files to manage could be an issue.
Even when that approach is ok why not use utility classes? This is where Tailwind came to the rescue!

Part 0 briefly explained the clone syscall. It&#x27;s like fork/vfork, but with more options to control the child process. Actually, some implementations of fork propagate the call to clone().
Besides controlling which parts of the execution context get shared from the parent process, the clone call offers the possibility for us to create a separate memory block for the child&#x27;s stack. The nix implementation of clone has the following signature:
pub fn clone(
 cb: CloneCb, 
 stack: &amp;mut [u8], 
 flags: CloneFlags, 
 signal: Option
) -&gt; Result

The signal argument, if specified, is sent back to the parent when the child process terminates…</span>

It is more likely than not that Docker and containers are going to be part of your IT career in one way or another.
In this blog post series I&#x27;ll cover the following:
  What are Docker images, containers and Docker Hub
  Installing Docker on Ubuntu Linux on a DigitalOcean Droplet
  Working with Docker containers
  Working with Docker images
  Deploying a Dockerized app
I&#x27;ll be using DigitalOcean for all of the demos, so I would strongly encourage you to create a DigitalOcean account follow along. You would learn more by doing!
To make things even better you can use my referral link to get a free $100 credit that you could use to deploy your virtual machines and test the guide yourself on a few DigitalOcean servers:

In this article, we will introduce a better way of managing and securing secrets using Doppler.
In this article, we will be using a music application linked to Firebase as a case study. The app makes use of its credentials to access and use Firebase services. We will cover how to set up a Doppler project and migrate our Firebase app credentials from the .env file to Doppler.

ในกรณีที่มีการเชื่อมต่อกับ Database ปกติถ้าทำงานกันแบบไวๆ หลายๆคนน่าจะเคยไปใส่ Password ไว้ใน Code บ้าง ใน ENV บ้าง แต่ Practice ในกรณีนี้ที่ AWS ให้ลองเล่นคือ ใช้ Secret Manager แล้วก็ใช้ Code ไปอ่านและ decrypt/parse ค่าที่ใช้ในการเชื่อมต่อกับ DB ออกมา 
ส่วนการ Rotate DB Password สามารถตั้งได้ใน Secret Manager แล้วใช้ Lambda Function เข้าไปแก้ Password database แล้วบันทึกเข้า Secret Manager อีกที

For seriously working with AWS, there&#x27;s no way around its Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. Skipping to understand its core principles will bite you again and again in the future️.
Take the time to do a deep dive, so you won&#x27;t be frustrated later.
Overview of the topics to cover:
  IAMs Capabilities

  Introduction


In this series of articles, we are going to learn how to create generic models and services step-by-step regarding the CRUD feature of resources in Angular.
In a nutshell, we&#x27;re going to learn:
How to use generics in Typescript
What is CRUD operations in APIs
How to create generic models in Angular
How to create generic service for CRUD in Angular

                    <span>We all agreed about not manipulating data inside component or better to say presentation layer.
So I decided to put logout logic inside guard, this way I will be able to just call logout route and done!
For this I&#x27;ve configured my authentication module routes like this:
{
    path: &#x27;login&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false }
  },
  {
    path: &#x27;register&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: true }
  },
  {
    path: &#x27;logout&#x27;,
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false },
    canActivate: [LogoutGuard]
  }

I love to keep things as simple and low as possible 😁
For log out I&#x27;ve added canActivate field and passed the LogoutGuard, the guards have the ability to return UrlTree. It is awesome, let&#x27;s see how the guard implemented:
@Injectable()
export class LogoutGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {
  }

  canActivate(): UrlTree {
    this.store.dispatch(logout());
    return this.router.createUrlTree([&#x27;auth&#x27;, &#x27;login&#x27;]);
  }
}

That&#x27;s it!
The canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!
After this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.

Preloading is great. It lets us fetch parts of our application before it is even requested for. By doing this, our content is ready to be served when needed without any delay. There are many ways of doing this, I&#x27;ll be touching upon some of the ways to do this in Angular and how we can create our own custom preloading strategy based on the user&#x27;s network state.
Angular provides us with route-based preloading out of the box. There are two strategies namely PreloadAllModules and NoPreloading.
NoPreloading, as the name suggests does not preload any modules. This is the default behaviour.
PreloadAllModules, on the other hand, preloads all modules. A simple example adding a preloading strategy in a routing module file can be seen below
app.routing.module.ts

                    <span>When we use external libraries, it is very common to declare a global object and use it.  But the price to pay is get complex testing scenario, and of course global object like magic is not a “good practice”.
How I can tell to angular about provide an external library declared as global?
My example was using the leaflet library, using the InjectionToken class and @Inject.
If you want to read more about it. 
— https://angular.io/api/core/InjectionToken

Install the leaflet package and register into the angular.json to load the library.
npm install leaflet

Open the angular.json file and add leaflet.css and leaflet.js assets.

                    <span>Different rendering methods can alter how much of the rendering falls on to clients, the search engine’s bot requesting the page, or the user’s browser. Two of the most popular rendering methods are isomorphic rendering and dynamic rendering. 
Isomorphic rendering makes use of Universal JavaScript, as it renders on both client-side or server-side. Dynamic rendering, on the other hand, is often considered to be a workaround for social media crawlers or search engines that are not running on JavaScript. This rendering method is recommended by search engines like Google or Bing. 
Both these rendering methods have their specific advantages, so choosing between them can be a bit difficult. This guide will help you make decisions on how to render your website by discussing these rendering method…</span>

                    <span>I have always wanted to access private servers (accessed only through VPN or SSH tunnels) through domains without going through the hassle of locally modifying hosts files in the client side (me and my colleagues) or the SSH config files, so here&#x27;s my attempt to solve this problem.
I used a t3a.nano AWS EC2 instance to demonstrate the idea with Ubuntu 20.04 on it, with OpenVPN as my VPN server and dnsmasq as a DNS server.
I used dnsmasq instead of something like BIND because it&#x27;s much easier to setup and maintain. 
This was made only for demonstration purpose, so to quickly setting up an OpenVPN server without pain I used angristan/openvpn-install script to do so.

                    <span>Transferring files to servers is a vital task in most software developers&#x27; life. Usually, we use protocols like FTP (File Transfer Protocol), FTPS, SFTP to transfer files. In this tutorial, we are going to briefly discuss the available protocols and their differences. Also, the tutorial will explain how to transfer files from client to server, server to client and server to server using SCP.
FTP is an old and insecure protocol that can be used to transfer files between local networks or computers connected through the Internet. However, FTP is not recommended to use to transfer files over the Internet anymore as it transfers usernames and passwords in cleartext. In addition to that, FTP provides an anonymous method that let you transfer files even without a username and password.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve slowly adding more and more lua functions into my neovim configuration,





  
  
  Telegraph.nvim


Check out the project readme
I want a simple way to make remaps into shell commands that can open new tmux
For example I want to make remaps to do things like open the current file in lookatme.
# vim :terminal
nnoremap s Telegraph pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark

# tmux session
nnoremap s lua require&#x27;telegraph&#x27;.telegraph({cmd&#x3D;&#x27;pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark&#x27;, how&#x3D;&#x27;tmux&#x27;})

# tmux popup
nnoremap S lua require&#x27;telegraph&#x27;.telegraph({cmd&#x3D;&#x27;pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark&#x27;, how&#x3D;&#x27;tmux_popup&#x27;})

The main goal here is that remaps become one liners that can just be put
init.vim without creating a whole new lua module for each
telegraph takes in a how argument to determine where to tun the command.j
term(default) runs command in the built in terminal
tmux runs command in a new tmux session and joins it.
tmux_popup runs command in a tmux popup window.
tmux_popup_session runs command in a tmux session and displays it in a popup
subprocess runs command in a subprocess
The current set of format strings that can be used with telegraph.  Placing
{} within your command will get rendered into something with
cword - the current word under the cursor
cWORD - the current BIG Word under the cursor
cline - the current line under the cursor
filepath - the filepath of the current file
filename - the filename of the current file
parent - the parent directory of the current file
current_session_name - name of the current tmux session
cwd - the current working directory
Check out the repo and give
it a star if its something that interests you.</span>

                    <span>Frameworks like Next.js (React 💙), Nuxt.js (Vue 💚) and Universal (Angular ❤️) allow you to register redirects.
Next.js allows you to register redirects using redirects function inside next.config.js


Nuxt.js allows you to register redirects using redirect-module in nuxt.config.js


Universal allows you to register redirects at server engine router level. e.g. @nguniversal/express-engine



But in all the cases when your app is served, it should stay on top of a nodejs server to handle all the requests.
But I want my application to be a static served application that lives only on client, without a server 😢
Well, this is the single limitation of all the frameworks redirects, but don&#x27;t be sad, we have a solution, that comes with it&#x27;s own limitations 😄

                    <span>Monitoring services is a big part of Cloud Infrastructure Management.  Here we will go through one way to install Prometheus on Ubuntu and make pretty dashboards with Grafana on a separate machine.
Go grab this download and extract to start:
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.11.1/prometheus-2.11.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

tar -xvzf prometheus-2.11.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

cd prometheus/

./prometheus

Should be great success:

Open a web browser and head over to the http://{IP}:9090/graph



Let&#x27;s run it as a service, create this file:
/etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service

And give it this basic text settings:
