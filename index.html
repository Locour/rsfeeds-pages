                    <span>Storybook and Angular components


Context : Angular 12, StoryBook 6.3.9
Hey, I started to use Storybook and I would Like to share my experience. Here’s the use case. I have a simple component which only use content projection:
@Component({
  selector: &quot;adr-label&quot;,
  template: &#x60;&#x60;,
})
_export class_ LabelComponent {}

Here’s the associated story:
_export default_ {
  title: &quot;atoms/forms/label&quot;,
  component: LabelComponent,
  decorators: [**componentWrapperDecorator** (LabelComponent)],
} _as Meta_;

_const_ BasicTemplate: _Story_ &#x3D; (args) &#x3D;&gt; ({
  moduleMetadata: { declarations: [InputDirective] },
  **template** : &#x60;{{ ngContent }}&#x60;,
  props: { ...args },
});

_export const_ Default &#x3D; BasicTemplate.bind({});
Default.args &#x3D; {
  **ngContent** : &quot;Un label&quot;,
};

The specificity here is to use a componentWrapperDecorator. It allows to wrap our component and to pass it some extras like in my case a text content.
You just have to define a template like in BasicTemplate to emulate the content projection and using it like an input.
In the Default args, I add an ngContent arg to set the content of my label. I choose this name “ngContent” because it appears in the controls list and I find it consistent to let know that’s a content projection in this way.
You can see the result here:

                    <span>The easiest solution to deploy a Rails application is something like Heroku or Hatchbox or DigitalOcean Apps. But for some small projects I like to use my existing VPS. 
I assume you have a VPS with Ubuntu 20.04 and Docker and Nginx installed.
DigitalOcean you can select the Docker image in the marketplace and add Nginx to it.
Lets create a new Rails project with PostgreSQL, esbuild and Tailwind on your local machine:
rails new demo -d postgresql --edge -j esbuild --css tailwind

Adjust you config/database.yml with the settings for your database.
Scaffold a simple table:
bin/rails g scaffold Book name:string

Then create your database and tables:
bin/rails db:create
bin/rails db:migrate

You can create a root path in routes.rb:

                    <span>Terraform Variables


When creating a terraform configuration, you have to configure and declare Input Variables. Input variables serve as parameters for a Terraform module and resources, allowing aspects of the module to be customized without altering the module&#x27;s own source code, and allowing modules to be shared between different configurations.  
The Terraform language uses the following types for its values:  
string: a sequence of Unicode characters representing some text, like &quot;hello&quot;.
number: a numeric value. The number type can represent both whole numbers like 15 and fractional values like 6.283185.
bool: a boolean value, either true or false. bool values can be used in conditional logic.
list (or tuple): a sequence of values, like [&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;]. Elements in a list or tuple are …</span>

                    <span>Terraform workspace is a very logical concept where you can have multiple states of your infrastructure configuration. To put this in simple words if you are running an infrastructure configuration in a development environment then the same infrastructure can be run in the production environment.
The main benefit of terraforming workspaces we get is we can have more than one state associated with a single terraform configuration.
If you have not defined any workspace then there is always a default workspace created by terraform, so you always work in a default workspace of terraform. You can list the number of terraform workspaces by running the command terraform workspace show. Also, you can not delete the default workspace

https://youtu.be/S5B09dq-jGQ 
While working with the AWS EC2 instance you do not get a Username and password to SSH into your EC2 instance. You have to either generate the SSH keys and associate the public key with the EC2 instance. After that, you need to use your private key to SSH into the virtual machine running in the AWS cloud. 
On similar lines, if you are using Terraform to provision your AWS infrastructure you need to associate the public key with your terraform script and after starting the EC2 instance you need to use your private key to SSH into the EC2 instance.
In this lab session, we are going to perform the following steps -  
Generate key-pair(public key, private key) using ssh-keygen
Use public key to start EC2 instance
Use the private key to SSH into EC2 instance</span>

                    <span>Terraform is an IaC(infrastructure as Code) framework for managing and provisioning the infrastructure but have you ever thought of creating only a single terraform configuration file for managing the complete cloud infrastructure.
Well, it sounds insane because if you only have a single file for managing the complete infrastructure then it will grow in complexity as well the line of configuration code will be manifold. That is why terraform introduced a concept of the module that will help you to organize your terraform configuration so that you can re-use the configuration and keep your terraform code more clean and more modular.
In this Lab session, we will create two modules module-1 and module-2. Inside each module, we will install the apache httpd server with each module is having its home page.

                    <span>Terraform dynamic block behaves pretty much the same as for or for-each loop. It not only iterates over the value range but also creates nested dynamic blocks which can be complex.  
Terraform dynamic block usually consists of three elements - 
Name of dynamic block 
for_each
content


Name of dynamic block - You can keep the name of the block as per your choice, terraform does not have very strict rules on defining the dynamic block names


for_each - Here you need to provide any collection or structural values which can be iterated


content - It is a terraform block or body which will be generated for each value of the for-each loop

1.File provisioner - The file provisioner will help you to copy the file securely from the local machine or development machine to the remote Ec2 instance.
Local provisioner - The local-exec provisioner invokes a local executable after a resource is created. This invokes a process on the machine running Terraform, not on the resource. It will help you to run the shell command onto your local machine instead of the remote EC2 instance. The local provisioners are  


Remote provisioner - The remote-exec provisioner invokes a script on a remote resource after it is created. This can be used to run a configuration management tool, bootstrap into a cluster, etc. It will help you to run the shell command onto the remote Ec2 instance of AWS or virtual machine of Google Cloud

  Prologue


After passing the AWS DAS in February this year, I&#x27;d been fascinating about how to become a professional lazybones[3] in spare time apart from building custom CDK constructs, sharing at the AWS Taiwan UG, internal sharing in my own company, and recording for an external session. All of sudden, I felt gotta keep moving on towards goals after studying the quintessence of lazybones for a while. So, the journey of pursuing the AWS DevOps Engineer Professional Certification began at that moment.

                    <span>Introduction


VIM is a text editor for writing code, where you navigate around the screen with the Keyboard instead of a Mouse.
VI which came about in 1976 by Bill Joy. It was later improved by Bram Mooleenar in 1991 with bunch of improvements and named VIM.
Why would you use VIM when we have modern IDEs? The answer is, when you write code, your fingers should be bound to keyboard all the time. Every time you touch mouse your work rate is interrupted.
Linux/MacOS: VIM comes preinstalled.
Windows: Download VIM, Download the installer and install it. 
Linux/MacOS: Type &quot;vim filename.txt&quot; in terminal (without quotations)
Windows: Open &quot;gVim8.1&quot; from desktop or search in start menu.
Esc to switch between modes)


VIM has many modes, but these four are commonly used:

                    <span>As a web developer, I am constantly looking to improve my skills. I’ve completed a full stack boot camp, followed dozens of tutorials, and built my own projects from scratch. As my skills have developed certain things have come into focus. Firstly, I know where my strengths lie; organizing code in a readable and maintainable codebase is a borderline obsession for me. I like small, modular components that keep individual files to a manageable size. React is a framework I have genuinely come to love. It has provided me with a much greater competency in “vanilla” JavaScript and a practical, consistent path to rendering my vision in the browser. Node.js was a struggle to get comfortable with at first, but building simple API’s has given me a much deeper understanding of how the web works as a …</span>

  A tip from the video: snippets.


For some reason I was very reluctant to make my own snippets. A mean I used build-in ones, or the ones that come with extensions, but I never made my own. Until recently I was using css modules and I got really tired typing import for my styles.
So I decided to give it a shot. Turns out even if it does not save you tons of time, I mean typing is like 1% of programming, it surely makes you feel better. So I guess my advice is if you get annoyed about typing something over and over, consider turning that thing into a snippet.
And here is that css modules snippet I was talking about for VS Code.

The motivation for writing this article is twofold.
The first reason for writing this article is to show that except the benefits of having your code tested ( confidence in the quality of your code, catch bugs before pushing code, etc ) it can also be quite as entertaining and educational as writing the actual code.
The second reason is for showing how we should write tests in isolation, meaning there should be no external interference that could probably skew test resu…</span>

                    <span>If you are developing in VSCode it&#x27;s quite typical that you&#x27;d be using the live-server extension to spin-up a quick development server. A few reasons sometimes you may not want to use liveserver.
It injects code into the file running that may create bugs where there is none


your not using VSCode


For some reason the extension isn&#x27;t showing up in the menu making it less convienient



In that case, the command line to the rescure, as there are several one line commands you can run to spin up a quick webserver for basic static file serving from a particular folder. Just navigate to that particular folder in terminal and run this command and now you can see those files served in the browser.
Likely you have one of the following installed or pre-installed on your computer, just run the following commands to see what you have.
python -v do you have pythong installed and what version


php -v do you have pythong installed and what version


node -v do you have pythong installed and what version


ruby -v do you have pythong installed and what version




  
  
  Python





# If Python version returned above is 3.X
# On Windows, try &quot;python -m http.server&quot; or &quot;py -3 -m http.server&quot;
python3 -m http.server

# If Python version returned above is 2.X
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

If you have ruby installed, first install webrick gem install webrick

then this command will start a server on port 8000 ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8000




  
  
  Node




npx lite-server will start server on localhost:3000
npx http-server will start server localhost:8080
npx serve will start server on localhost:5000
php -S localhost:5000 will start a server on localhost:5000

                    <span>It was 2006, AJAX was being widely adopted to build dynamic web experiences. As web apps became more complex, there was a need to make building them simpler. Thus the dawn of the framework wars began.
I can&#x27;t talk about the first frameworks/libraries without mentioning jquery of course. In this wave, libraries mainly focused providing some UI widgets, DOM manipulation, and AJAX. Dojo Toolkit appears to be the first framework ever released in 2004. jQuery was released in 2006, along with mootools and yui. However, that fact that you probably only recognized jQuery is testament to its domination.
In 2009 JavaScript was updated to EcmaScript Version 5, with growing platform capabilities and user expectations a second wave of frameworks began. Frameworks likes Angular in 2009, Backbone JS in 2…</span>

                    <span>Intro


This time, I will try decorators.
As a result, I couldn&#x27;t do that in this time.
So I just tried using them in this time.
TypeScript ver.4.4.3
Webpack ver.5.56.0
webpack-cli ver.4.8.0
I think the decorators are special kinds of functions for classes and class members.
// Compile error: Decorators are not valid here
@message(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
export function funcSample() {
}

I can add decorators into classes, methods, properties, accessors, and paramters.
import { Sample } from &quot;./sample&quot;;

function init(): void {
    const s &#x3D; new Sample();
    s.userName &#x3D; &#x27;Masanori&#x27;;
    s.greet(&#x27;Hello!&#x27;);
}
init();

import { classDecorator, methodDecorator, methodDecoratorFactory } from &quot;./decoratorSample&quot;;

// Class decorators

JavaScript - anyString.includes(&#x27;&#x27;) returns true might seem absurd but the behaviour matches anyString.substring(0, 0) returning &#x27;&#x27; and anyString.indexOf(&#x27;&#x27;) returning 0. Be careful when attempting something like providedString.includes(searchString). More on the method on MDN Web Docs.
TypeScript - JSX is the reason we can type cast using the as operator (HTMLElement as HTMLInputElement) in addition to using angle brackets ( HTMLElement) which will be difficult to parse when mixed with JSX HTML-like syntax, as stated on TypeScript official documentation page.
AWS - Lambda functions can now run on the Arm-based Graviton2 processors by specifying arm64 as the architecture. It is said to be able to provide up to 34% price performance improvement. Details are available on the official AWS blog page.
On the week 39 of 2021, I learned that the Kindle&#x27;s Vocabulary Builder feature not only automatically add words as flash cards, but also show the usage of a word in the book. Having that usage context might have encouraged me to use the feature more but I wish I could&#x27;ve discovered it couple of years earlier.

                    <span>TypeScript 4.1 has brought a nice feature called Template literal types. Many authors have written about it, so I won&#x27;t stop here and explain how it works. Instead, I would like to show you an example of how we can use it. Let&#x27;s not waste our time!
Every i18n module has a translate function (also can be named as short t). Assume that we have a function with such a signature:
declare function translate(path: string, variables?: Record): string;

As the first parameter, we can pass a dot delimited keys of a translation object. It can be a JSON object or JavaScript object, whatever. The main thing is that TypeScript can&#x27;t check path correctness and possible variable existence in the translated sentence with such signature.

                    <span>Motivation


When we develop a Single-Page Application, we usually only define its behavior in a single browser window, and even if the same application is opened on multiple browser windows, in most cases it is only synchronized with the local storage, and the state of each application in each window is not synchronized in real time (unless the server synchronizes), they run in isolation and are relatively independent.
However, this means that more browser windows will generate more and more independent application instances, which may have different UI states and often inevitably have the same network requests or WebSocket connections, which may also mean a bad user experience (as users may have become accustomed to) and excessive usage of server resources.
So what does it mean to have a…</span>

                    <span>This blog summarises on use case in which common chunk is created in an Angular application.
We will start by creating a new angular application using ng new my-app command present in cli.
In this application we will have a toast module which will show toast on click of a button.
We will load toast module inside multiple modules and check how its shipped to the user.
It doesn&#x27;t included basic Angular commands like creating component, module.
Let&#x27;s start then.
As a first use case we will include the toast module in the main app module.
The toast module has a component and a service which is used to create the message and can be called by outside module where its injected, in our use case its app module.
As we have injected toast module in main app module its included in main chunk of angula…</span>

                    <span>Being proactive is essential for any application whether that concerns the API, the web or mobile application. You can capture errors as they happen, with zero involvement from application users. Then of course you can work to fix the error, contact end users or whatever might seem appropriate on each case.
As part of this article we examine how we can setup proactive monitoring using Angular 12 and Datadog, by following two different approaches. The implementation should be similar for React and Vue and of course this can be adjusted to use Sentry or any other Datadog alternative.
Datadog is mostly popular as a cloud and infrastructure monitoring but it can be also used as a centralized logging platform. Personally I find that you get better application insights when you combine infrastru…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
highcharts is a rich and interactive charts library based on SVG.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the application with the Angular base structure using the @angular/cli with the route file and the SCSS style format.
ng new angular-highcharts
? Would you like to add Angular routing? Yes
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? SCSS   [ https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss                ]

                    <span>I&#x27;m not gonna talk about how does a DHCP server work exactly, 
If one of the devices in the network is configured with a static IP address, when the DHCP server starts distributing the IP addresses to other machines, what happens exactly ? does it skip it ? or does it duplicate it and therefore there would be a conflict ? 
So the answer is, NOPE the DHCP server will not distribute that IP address, you may be wondering, but how ?
Remember that the DHCP server sends an ARP Broadcast asking about the IP address about to be distributed 
&quot;Who has x.x.x.x&quot;
At that moment the machine with that static IP address will respond with an ARP saying that it got that IP and that its MAC address is X:X:X:X:X:X so the DHCP server will continue to the next IP address asking &quot;Who has y.y.y.y&quot;
But here comes another problem, 
what if the local network is placed behind a router, and we all know that the routers doesn&#x27;t allow broadcasting, then what happens ?
well simply instead of ARP Broadcasting, it uses ICMP Packet type 8 code 0 which is the ECHO request ( ping ) and if it gets no answer than it distributes it, else it simply continues to the next IP address.
And here comes the last question, 
And what if a device that is configured with a static IP address was shutdown, and the DHCP distributed its IP address, what happens if the machine is up again?
well there are two solutions for this, some DHCP servers are advanced enough and caches the static IP address and therefore this conflict will never occurs, but if the DHCP server doesn&#x27;t provide this feature, than it should be configured to exclude these IP addresses or else there will be an IP Duplication.
And this pretty much sums up the main problems of dealing with a DHCP server.</span>

We&#x27;re using it for business meetings, side projects and anything else where we need some flexible coordination. However, most tools are very limited in terms of control, customization, data protection, and most important - they are not free! That&#x27;s where Calendso &amp; Synpse come in. Self-hosted, all your data sitting on your own machines. API-driven and ready to be deployed on your own domain. Full control of your events and data.
In this tutorial we will be deploying a self-hosted Calendso instance that lives under your own DNS domain. You will be able to share meeting links such as https://calendar.synpse.net/karolis/quick-chat with your colleagues, clients and friends:

                    <span>The Problem


If you’re like me and run a home Linux server, you may wish to add some extra security in the form of a VPN connection to ensure traffic is encrypted. In my case, I use a Raspberry Pi to backup things like RAW images from my camera to an off-site location. The extra security gives me a little peace of mind, especially as the server generally uses a cellular connection.
I’ve been using UFW to work as a killswitch and only allow traffic via the VPN connection, but one issue I&#x27;ve had is with my trusted VPN provider is that they regularly rotate IP addresses. UFW uses iptables under the hood, meaning it can only be configured to use IP addresses explicitly and not a domain name. This has left my backup machine without an internet connection fairly frequently.

You can use my referral you will get $100 free usage for 3 months.


And when we open the config file we will see these details.

Kubectl need to connect to the k8s master, we nees:
DNS/IP of the cluster
Authentication Credentials
which will found in kubeconfig.
I&#x27;m setting up in windows. So, will be using below reference.
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/
Download this Kubectl binary

Next Step, Move that Binary to C:\Binaries. If Binaries folder is not there, create one.

Create a Environment Variable to call this Binary.

Move the kubeconfig file to C:\Users\ .kube and name it as config ( removing .yml extension)

To Verify, run kubectl , it will work from any path.

For, linux and MacOS installation refer below link.

                    <span>Buat kalian yang pengen berkarir di IT, baik di Tim Developer, Operations maupun Security, menguasai Linux bisa menjadi nilai plus buat kalian apalagi tim Operations dan Security yang sehari-hari tidak bisa lepas dari server.
Karena menurut data statistik, 1 juta website terpopuler pake Linux buat OS Server-nya.
Lalu, kita ngga bisa denial kalo OS pilihan dari kebanyakan hacker itu ya Linux..
Ini karena hacker-hacker tuh suka otak-atik semaunya sendiri dan karena Linux itu open-source, Linux bisa di-customize buat nyesuaiin kebutuhan mereka.
Dan juga, unethical dan bad hackers biasanya pake tools yang mereka bikin sendiri atau yang sudah tersedia di Linux untuk nge-hack ke dalam jaringan dan aplikasi yang lemah dan rentan keamanannya.
Banyak Distro Linux yang sudah terinstall tools buat hacking yang siap pake.
Tapi jika tools tersebut belum ada, maka tinggal diinstall dong wkwk.
Diantara Distro Linux buat hacking yang umum dipake adalah:
Kali Linux, yang berbasis dari varian Debian.
BackBox, yang berbasis dari varian Ubuntu.
Parrot Security OS, yang berbasis dari varian Debian.
CAINE, yang berarti Computer Aided INvestigative Environment yang biasanya dipake buat Digital Forensic dan
Samurai Web Testing Framework untuk pentest (penetration testing) aplikasi web (web application).
Jadi jika kalian mau berkarir di Tim Operations (seperti DevOps dan SRE) maupun belajar hacking sebagai hobi, atau untuk menjadi ethical hacker, kalian wajib belajar dan jago di Linux xD.</span>

                    <span>Linux Command Line atau Shell adalah process dari OS yang memungkinkan kita untuk mengatur komputer dengan menggunakan perintah-perintah sebagai text interface.
Pada Desktop Environment modern, tidak terlalu penting juga menggunakan Shell.
Tapi kebanyakan tool-tool buat hacking itu berbasis CLI dan jika kita mau belajar hacking, hukumnya fardhu &#x27;ain (sangat wajib) buat terbiasa di &quot;dunia hitam&quot; eh Shell terminal maksudnya dan juga wajib tahu di luar-kepala tentang perintah dasar dan perintah advance dari Linux.
Coba ketik perintah date
$ date
Sat  2 Oct 15:41:49 UTC 2021

Maka akan muncul jam dan tanggal seperti contoh di atas.
Pada series Belajar Linux Commands kita akan belajar tentang macam-macam perintah Linux yang wajib kita tahu jika kita ingin menjadi hacker xD.

I have created a self-interview preparation CLI toolkit, which will show me random questions whenever I run a CLI command called &quot;interview&quot;.
Sounds cool right.
I felt I would require a real-time experience of attending an interview, but I wanted to have control over what I could be expecting, and still having the random unexpectedness of attending an interview.
This simple project I felt was in the right direction.

Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications*

                    <span>Good day !
Coming home from the Devoxx conference in Paris, the main technology that I wanted to try out and explore was serverless.
Just to clarify what serverless is in a few words :
Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. Servers are still used, but a company that gets backend services from a serverless vendor is charged based on usage, not a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers. (Source : cloudflare)
I&#x27;ve been playing around with NestJS (a NodeJS framework) for some time now and wanted to try building a server using AWS lambda functions using NestJS for the backend of an application.
To speed up the process and have a nice base to kickstart my projects, I&#x27;ve built a simple repository (usable as a template on Github). It contains the…</span>

                    <span>I once heard a colleague ask, &#x27;how do you survive with javascript(js), so many libraries. Nodejs, Reactjs, Angularjs, Vuejs, expressjs. Terrible, I pity you guys. Infact I know there is probably another js cooking&#x27;, laughing hysterically. 

I forgave my colleague for saying nodejs is a Javascript library, because he is wrong and nodejs is not a Javascript library.
Nodejs is runtime environment for javascript on the server. It uses the javascript v8 engine, hence it&#x27;s a single threaded, event driven environment.

                    <span>we as developer have hundred of project in the machine, but have you&#x27;ve ever wondered how much space node_modules takes on single project and what happens when you&#x27;re running out of free space. this will help you to make some free space safely.
before removing let&#x27;s show all the node_modules directories and its memory. cause the removing process is irrevisable so we need to make sure. first cd into a specific directory where most of the projects are:
LINX/MACOS
$ cd Dev/
$ find . -name &quot;node_modules&quot; -type d -prune | xargs du -chs


WINDOW
$ cd Dev 
$ FOR /d /r . %d in (node_modules) DO @IF EXIST &quot;%d&quot; echo %d&quot;

now let&#x27;s remove all the node_modules directories from all the projects. make sure that you&#x27;re inside a directory where you&#x27;re comfortable removing all the node_modules cause this action is irereversable:
LINUX
$ cd Dev
$ find . -name &quot;node_modules&quot; -type d -prune -exec rm -rf &#x27;{}&#x27; +

WINDOW
$ cd Dev 
$ FOR /d /r . %d in (node_modules) DO @IF EXIST &quot;%d&quot; rm -rf &quot;%d&quot;

a single node_modules took about 400MB - 90MB in my cases and total space it took around 10gigabyte - 15gigabyte. it will help you to free up some space in your machine if you have limited SSD, but if you&#x27;ve removed from all the directories, you have to install it again for the project you&#x27;re working on, keep this in mind.

Let&#x27;s open our terminal and hit npm install node-imap. to install IMAP package.
In this blog, we are mainly focusing on how to read email attachments based on the DATE RANGE, FROM particular email address and it&#x27;s SUBJECT.
Let&#x27;s see from the below example code which fetches first 3 email messages from the mail box.

                    <span>❓ What is CORS?


Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a “preflight” request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.

The solution to bypass CORS is to use a Proxy. A Proxy server, that forwards your request as it is.
But, problems with a Proxy Server is to manage the server, optimize the server, handle traffic, use of Kubernetes to minimize bills, and what n…</span>

                    <span>The Problem


If you’re like me and run a home Linux server, you may wish to add some extra security in the form of a VPN connection to ensure traffic is encrypted. In my case, I use a Raspberry Pi to backup things like RAW images from my camera to an off-site location. The extra security gives me a little peace of mind, especially as the server generally uses a cellular connection.
I’ve been using UFW to work as a killswitch and only allow traffic via the VPN connection, but one issue I&#x27;ve had is with my trusted VPN provider is that they regularly rotate IP addresses. UFW uses iptables under the hood, meaning it can only be configured to use IP addresses explicitly and not a domain name. This has left my backup machine without an internet connection fairly frequently.

                    <span>Post-quantum cryptography is being developed, benchmarked, tested, discussed, and elaborated... Let me join in on that with a little practical software piece. falcon-cli is a CLI tool to sign and verify files with the post-quantum signature scheme FALCON, a round 3 finalist for digital signature algorithms in NIST&#x27;s post-quantum cryptography standardization competition.
The tool supports keygen, file sign and verify ops, as such it is complete and ready for common file signature use cases. Imagine - now you can sign your Github Releases with (probably) post-quantum safe signatures and chill (4ever)...
Usage should be straightforward when glimpsin&#x27; over the README. The default key location shouldn&#x27;t be surprisin&#x27; as well: ~/.falcon-cli/(public|secret).key. Also, if explicit input or output files are omitted, the tool falls back to stdin and stdout for IO.

Using .env files to manage application config and secrets is a step forward from hard-coding secrets, but there are also security risks and issues relating to the synchronization and manual management of .env files across different environments. This tutorial introduces Doppler, a solution to secret management and synchronization.
In this article, we have a Django application that has its secrets defined in a .env file. We will look at how we can move those secrets from the traditional .env file to Doppler.
Managing secrets and configs in Doppler keeps them in sync across different environments. You only have to define your secrets once and Doppler acts as a central source of truth for your secrets, saving you the stress of having to re-define them in every environment or share t…</span>

I&#x27;ve been studying functional programming for a few years and in doing so I&#x27;ve learned a lot about types that I would not have otherwise. In particular, studying haskell and related technology begets some interesting concepts. The one I want to talk about this time is &quot;algebraic types&quot;.
From wikipedia:
In computer programming, especially functional programming and type theory, an algebraic data type is a kind of composite type, i.e., a type formed by combining other types.
If you&#x27;ve used TypeScript for a bit you&#x27;ve probably been exposed to some of these already.

Recently while I was working on one of my projects, I encountered a relatively common problem. I wanted to scroll to a component when its loaded on screen or on some other event. If you have worked with pure js, then there is a very simple solution using scrollIntoView function.
const elmnt &#x3D; document.getElementById(&quot;content&quot;);
elmnt.scrollIntoView();

Run the above code on that particular event and it works like a charm.
Now when I searched for a solution in React, I came across this library react-scroll. Its a react library for animating vertical scrolling that provides functionality to scroll to a component on an event. Its good but I didn&#x27;t want to add another dependency a…</span>

Hey, often we make console.log(...) to see the value of a parameter or a result method.
Here I present you a decorator which allow to do it easily. It’s purpose is for debugging when you are developing something.
Now that’s how to use it:
class Toto {
  @Log()
  public myMethod(...args: unknown[]): boolean { ... }

  @Log({ outputs: false })
  public myMethod2(...args: unknown[]): void { ... }

  @Log({ inputs: false })
  public myMethod3(...args: unknown[]): unknown { ... }

  @Log({ type: &#x27;trace&#x27; })
  public myMethod4(...args: unknown[]): unknown { ... }

  @Log({ type: &#x27;trace&#x27;, inputs: false, outputs: false })
  public myMethod5(...args: unknown[]): unknown { ... }

}

Hope this could help or inspire someone.

I will not just be copying and pasting the information, but learning, and bringing it to you in a concise manner. Please enjoy and don&#x27;t be timid to send me a message of what you think!

TypeScript is a superset of Javascript, invented by Microsoft, that adds strong type checking. Hence, the &#x27;type&#x27; in TypeScript, I guess. The TS code is taken into a compiler and then translated into JS code, meaning all of the features of JS are available to us, plus the added features of TS. 
Some added features are:

                    <span>As your codebase grows, there is only one way to increase developer productivity: Documentation. One of many reasons I prefer TypeScript to JavaScript is that overtime, as your codebase grows, developer productivity increases because TypeScript (and typed languages in general) offer something that dynamically typed languages cannot, automatic documentation in your IDE.
This article assumes you&#x27;re familiar with React Query. If you&#x27;re not, I highly recommend you read the official docs and this intro guide by Sai Kranthi.

                    <span>Angular is a front-end technology, so it becomes essential to find and utilize the finest resources globally when building web applications. End-user experience is definitely going to be affected directly by this!
When looking for an outsourcing Angular Full stack developer, there are few things one should always keep in mind. The Angular Developer must be capable of upscaling your product development capabilities.
To accomplish this goal, there are numerous options available to choose from, for example, Freelancing, in-house Angular Developers, hiring remote offshore developers, or outsourcing from any globally accredited Angular development company.

It allows users to authenticate themselves using Google and then purchase spare parts and essentials for automobiles.
With TalkJS, AllParts have implemented a buyer-seller chat that the customers can use to resolve queries, get recommendations or ask general questions. It is not a full-fledged application but goes well with this tutorial. You can set up your project from GitHub before getting started and if you’ve already done that, let’s get going.

So as part of my current education we&#x27;re doing something they call pop-up internship where you go to visit a company for a day or two and run through a couple different departments to get a feel for how different companies might tackle some of the daily tasks they encounter.
One company in particular had an app in development that really got me interested. They were building a web application for one of their customers based on the Angular framework from what I understand. The backend/serverside code was written in Java. The interesting part is that they used some way to turn the expoted Java-WAR into a file they would include in the Angular project. This allowed them to call methods from that service and, what was the most interesting to me, the classes for the project were only defined in that Java code yet perfectly usable in that Angular code. I saw some kind of service URL in the code which I assume is somehow being used to make the actual calls in some way.
Unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t able to dig deep enough/get into the deeper questions I had regarding the whole procedure. 
I don&#x27;t have any experience with Java, writing mostly little PHP and C# applications so far so I wondered - is a model like this possible to set up with Angular and PHP? If yes, where do I need to look in terms of guidance to set something like that up with my Angular project? What are some key things I need to know before tackling something like this? Is it even worth doing like that?
There&#x27;s a lot floating in my head right now regarding this because this is kinda exciting to me, any and all help would be greatly appreciated</span>

When deploying applications on netlify, we usually add our app’s environment variables manually. And whenever there’s a need to update it, we have to go back there to netlify to do it. With Doppler, an organization/team or individuals can manage their application’s environment variables easily. In this article, we will be learning how to integrate Doppler with Netlify.
In this article, we will clone a mini e-commerce project built with Reactjs that uses firebase for authentication from Github, save the app’s environment variables in a doppler workspace and sync it with netlify. To achieve this, we will set up a doppler account, create a workspace, add a project to the workspace and sync it with netlify.

                    <span>Opa!! Vamos avançar em nossa série. Hoje aprenderemos como controlar o acesso com filtro de IP e autenticação interna.
Você pode bloquear um IP (ou faixa de IP) utilizando a diretiva deny. Além do IP, é possível também utilizar o CIDR para bloquear requisições.
# Syntax: deny address | CIDR | unix: | all;
# Default: —
# Context: http, server, location, limit_except
#
# Bloqueia um IP específico
deny 127.0.0.1;

# Bloqueia faixa 142.250.218.0 - 142.250.218.255
deny 142.250.218.0/24;

# Bloqueia uma faixa de IP do tipo IPV6
deny 2001:0db8::/32;

# Bloqueia todos os acessos
deny all;

Bloqueando acesso a arquivos
Com o deny, também é possível bloquear acesso aos arquivos ou a um diretório. Basta utilizar a diretiva dentro do contexto location, por exemplo.

If you’re planning to build a native Android app that requires users to log in, you should use Auth0. 
Implementing user login/logout often turns into its own project. Just implementing the many ways users want to log in can easily take a lot of time. You’d also have to deal with issues such as user management, scaling, and security, each of which could have its own article.
With Auth0 and a few lines of code, your app can have a full-featured system that supports logging in with a basic username/password combination, single sign-on and social accounts, passwordless login, biometrics, and more. You won’t have to handle the “behind the scenes” issues, either!

Conclusion
Code review is a part of regular development practices for any corporation. However, adding security elements to the code review is the most effective measure in preventing vulnerabilities, even before the first commit. Additionally, the code review process provides itself with sharing security best practices amongst a development team. Finally, it produces &#x27;lessons&#x27; that we can learn to prevent future bugs.
The primary purpose of security engineers is to work collaboratively with the rest of the team to figure out a way not to reproduce the same vulnerabilities or at least implement a mechanism to minimize them.

                    <span>To be safe on the Internet, it is essential to pass information through encrypted communication. 🔐
This is also called encrypted streams. 🔐
But how does it work all these exchanges to arrive at a result where my data is in encrypted flows and it is inviolable? 🤔
As a developer, I&#x27;m going to need to understand how all of this works so that I can implement it effectively in my app or website. 👨🏼‍💻
As a security engineer, it is essential to know how it works in order to be sure that there are no potential vulnerabilities in the implementation of my web service. 👷🏼‍♂️
As an individual &quot;general public&quot;, it is classy to know these type of things to shine in society. 😄
I&#x27;ll explain all of that to you in this week&#x27;s video .... 👆🏼

                    <span>In this post I&#x27;m going to explain you how to code playfair cipher to encrypt plaintext to cipher. So this post is all about encryption program and will soon add decryption program in this series also so stay tuned!
If you don&#x27;t know how the algorithm works checkout previous post in this series.
So Without further ado, LET&#x27;S BEGIN!!👨‍💻👩‍💻
Yes, You&#x27;re right! 
three steps:
Convert plaintext into digraphs (i.e., into pair of two letters)
Generate a Cipher Key Matrix
Encrypt plaintext using Cipher Key Matrix and get ciphertext.
 

  
  
  Programming Playfair Cipher:


  
  
  Step: 1 Creating function to convert plaintext into digraphs




  



 
 


  
  
  Now we need to locate index of particular character inside cipher key matrix to perform encryption:




  



 
 


  
  
  Final Step! Running our code from main method:
