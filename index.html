Systemizing Router Animations | Zack DeRose

Debugging an Angular app | David Müllerchen
Token security and ESLint in Angular | Philippe De Ryck &amp; James Henry
Can an Angular application store tokens in localStorage?
– Yes, of course! LocalStorage is persistent storage, so the token is available to all tabs and windows. It even survives a browser restart.
– No, absolutely not! LocalStorage is insecure, and an attacker will be able to steal the token.
Believe it or not, but both answers are correct. As simple as this question is, the answer is far fr…</span>

                    <span>Custom software development is a lot of things, but you’d be hard pressed to find a way to describe it as “easy”.
It takes a lot of planning and resources. Often you need a team to make it happen. Technology is changing at an incredible rate, so you need to get serious about adopting a methodology too.
There’s risks and rewards and, like everything else, you celebrate the wins and learn from the mistakes.
But one of the things experienced in all areas of software development, from business owners to junior developers and everyone in between, is the nagging, gut-wrenching feeling of uncertainty.
Sometimes it hits you in a coding sprint or maybe in the middle of a planning meeting. Maybe it even keeps you up at night as you’re reflecting on the day.
Regardless of when or how it happens, ever…</span>

This article is targeted to beginning-to-intermediate-level Angular developers wishing to obtain insight into methods for state management in front-end applications. A simple, but highly customizable, reactive state-management service is constructed on top of the RxJs BehaviorSubject. This approach can be used for both management of a global store or as model manager for a lazy-loaded route. Both use cases are illustrated through an Angular version 8 application.
While the code in this application may be extended for practical use in your own applications, there is another motivation for studying the internals of state management. Doing so provides a better understanding of the underlying details of such management, which makes you a better consumer of t…</span>

                    <span>Angular Composition API is a lightweight (3kb), experimental library for writing functional Angular applications.
function State(props: Props) {
  Subscribe(() &#x3D;&gt; {
    console.log(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
  })
}

This library introduces an execution context that removes a lot of the ceremony needed to wire and orchestrate Angular components. It provides a layer of abstraction on top of existing Angular constructs, such as lifecycle hooks, change detection, queries, host bindings and host listeners. It embraces the power of RxJS with composable subscriptions. Angular Composition API is designed to feel native to the Angular developer.
There are two core APIs: View and Service.
The View API is a mixin that extends an Angular component or directive. It takes a State factory function and optional Prop…</span>

Myth #1: Steep Learning Curve in Angular

One of the famous misleading opinions we observe among people especially on Twitter and youtube gurus is ‘Angular has a steep learning curve’. The short answer is yes, Angular has not a small road to learning and master. But let’s first analyze the definition of this concept. A steep learning curve refers to: ‘The amount of time required to learn is big’. Interesting but what makes it BIG? First, let’s point out Angular is a fully-featured framework.

                    <span>Every project journey begins with the step of initialization. When your overall project is composed of multiple projects, it is tempting to create one Git repository per project. In Node.js, a project translates to a package. However, managing too many closely related repositories is confusing and time-consuming.
Placing multiple projects inside a single Git repository and using a tool like Lerna to facilitate their management worth the effort. This architecture is called a monorepo. It simplifies the versioning and publishing of the components as well as their manipulation and development.
At Adaltas, we have been developing and maintaining several monorepos for a couple of years. This article is the first one from a serie of five in which we share our best practices. It covers the projec…</span>

Modern software and system architectures encourage the decoupling of different layers/services in an application&#x27;s design. These services and/or layers can be web service APIs, database systems, cache proxy servers, serverless functions, etc. Communication between these elements is done by sending data in the form of messages from one point to another, oftentimes asynchronously. In this post, we will look at one of the tools that helps broker messages between the layers and services in these architectures and ensure that messages are transferred at a rate that can be handled by the intended destination service/layer.
A message queue is a component in a system&#x27;s architecture that helps buffer and distribute asynchronous requests. As stated earlier, a message is sent in a requ…</span>

                    <span>Often times it isn’t obvious whether an app or program features a dark mode. And it’s often an unassuming option buried in a menu somewhere.
But for those of you who are night owls, you’ll know that it works by reversing the usual color scheme of your windows putting light colored text on a dark background.
But it isn’t as simple as just Inverting the colors on a web page and calling it a day and you can see this if you have a browser extension that applies a dark mode as some elements on the page often. Don’t look as nice while other ones such as images won’t invert or dim properly.
So coding a good-looking dark mode that is specific to a certain website often requires a fair. A bit of finesse.
However, this often ends up being worth it as dark mode ends up delivering quite a few benefits…</span>

                    <span>In order to secure your website with Basic HTTP authentication in Traefik do the following.
apache2-utils





sudo apt install apache2-utils

htpasswd -nB adam

The n option will display the hash in stdout and the B option will use more secure encryption.
devto password&#x27;s hash is shown below:
adam:$2y$05$h9OxLeY20/5uiXjfPgdRxuFlrfqBf2QifYDgrwsR6rAEgX3/dpOGq

adam:$$2y$$05$$h9OxLeY20/5uiXjfPgdRxuFlrfqBf2QifYDgrwsR6rAEgX3/dpOGq

Remember to use the escaped double $.
You may have existing rules for your HTTPS route, e.g. compressing, etc.
So create a new chain where you&#x27;ll combine your existing middlewars and the newly created yoursite-basicauth.
In your docker-compose.yml file:
  labels:
    - &quot;traefik.http.middlewares.yourservice-https-chain.chain.middlewares&#x3D;yourservice-basicauth,yourservice-other-middleware-remove-or-replace-with-yours&quot;
    - &quot;traefik.http.routers.yourservice-https.middlewares&#x3D;yourservice-https-chain&quot;


Restart your service and your website will now prompt browsers for username and password.</span>

- Tem algum curso bom?
- Quais são as melhores escolas?
Saí em busca das respostas, na maravilhosa rede internética mundial de computadores e como nada é simples, muito menos na vida de um newbie, todos os lugares respondiam coisas diferentes.

                    <span>When I started writing code, I used Notepad and Notepad++. When I switched to OS X. In my first computer science class in high school we used Visual Studio.
When I finally migrated to Linux, I started using vi/vim after using nano for a while. Unlike nano, vim is a lot more powerful but is harder to learn.
How did I go from never using vim to using it all the time? How does one make a complete switch? I&#x27;ll walk you through how I got here and share some tips along the way.
If you are trying to learn Vim, or you are on the fence about it, here are my top 5 reasons why I love this keyboard-centered editor:
The more I used it, the faster I became, and the faster I became the more productive I was.


It&#x27;s everywhere. Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and every other operating system supports Vi/Vim. 


I don&#x27;t like to use my mouse. I never did anything in Sublime Text without the help of my mouse. This is a annoying, easier to keep hands on the keyboard


It can be used over the network using ssh. Login to any box and use it.


I use it for almost everything: programming, writing, blogging, etc.




Switching is up to you, but here are my reasons.
Why would somebody use ancient tools like vi/vim when there are so many modern ones out there? 
One day I had to answer this question for my friend. He asked, “Why don’t you use Sublime Text like me?” I explain to him that sometimes it’s better to use older/simpler tools than more complex ones.
Here are my reasons:
Learn how to use the best editor ever made.
Never get lost in a sea of menus and toolbars that you never use (just like vim does not have any).
Have an excuse to use powerful, built-in commands that are available in no other editor (and are faster than anything you can do with a GUI).
Work fast using commands

                    <span>tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals (or windows), each running a separate program, to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. 
tmux may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached. 
It allows you to easily manage separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window. 
tmux can connect to a server, and multiple clients can be connected to the same session, simultaneously exchanging their input and display.

You can use these commands and shortcuts to work with tmux in Linux. From the command line:



Session Control





tmux
Start a new session


tmux new -s 
Start a new session with the name chosen


tmux ls
List all sessions






Pane Control





Ctrl b, &quot;
Split pane horizontally


Ctrl b, %
Split pane vertically


Ctrl b, o
Next pane



I&#x27;ve used tmux for years, and it has become an essential part of my work flow. I couldn&#x27;t imagine editing code without it. If you want to practice Linux commands, you can use these exercises 
tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.
Features include:
• Splitting a terminal window into horizontal or vertical panes.

tmux is very useful for people who commonly work on remote machines via ssh.
Why did I pick tmux over screen and a terminal multiplexer? Three reasons.
First, tmux is written is responsive and light.
Second, tmux is much more expressive than screen. I can split my terminal into six panes and change the size of each pane with the same ease as resizing a terminal in GNU Screen.
Third, tmux has integrated support for a status bar. This means I can read from one pane and keep an eye on other panes at the same time.</span>

                    <span>This is one of the strange problems of VirtualBox which drives me crazy until I figured out, how simple the solution was.
If you are running from the same problem, don&#x27;t worry. Just make sure you are using the right installer for your distribution/OS
By the way, Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6 (&gt;&#x3D;2.28) or libc6 (&gt;&#x3D;2.29) is referred to as the same problem
OK, Let me explain a bit further,  A few months ago I was wanted to install VirtualBox on my Linux Mint computer, So, I went to the VirtualBox Official website (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads) but I won&#x27;t found the installer for Linux Mint Version there ( It&#x27;s still not present here as you can see in the picture below)

So, I choose  Ubuntu 19.10 / 20.04 / 20.10 / 21.04 from the available list because I knew Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu. so, whatever works on Ubuntu should be work on Linux Mint as well. It was not a big deal. But in the installation, it just won&#x27;t worked and threw this Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6 (&gt;&#x3D;2.28) error.

At that moment I reconsider my OS. I was using Linux Mint 19.3 Cinnamon. OS version placed a critical role here. I simply Googled &quot;Linux Mint 19.3 Ubuntu Version&quot;  and found Mint 19.3 is based on Ubuntu 18.04 . 
I revisit the download page and download it again but now from the  Ubuntu 18.04 / 18.10 / 19.04  option and run the installer and Guess what, It was running absolutely fine without any issue. Through the installer required some extra dependency, not an issue, just allowed it

Maybe you downloaded the Debian 10 version installer, not working.. then download it for Debian 9. Fedora 33/34 not working... download it for Fedora 32. Just make sure that the VirtualBox installer is compatible with your OS version :)

                    <span>Every project journey begins with the step of initialization. When your overall project is composed of multiple projects, it is tempting to create one Git repository per project. In Node.js, a project translates to a package. However, managing too many closely related repositories is confusing and time-consuming.
Placing multiple projects inside a single Git repository and using a tool like Lerna to facilitate their management worth the effort. This architecture is called a monorepo. It simplifies the versioning and publishing of the components as well as their manipulation and development.
At Adaltas, we have been developing and maintaining several monorepos for a couple of years. This article is the first one from a serie of five in which we share our best practices. It covers the projec…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Rate limiting is a method used for controlling network traffic. It limits the number of actions a user can make per unit of time 1. In this tutorial, we will rate limit a login route to help protect it from brute force attacks. This limits the number of password guesses that can be made by an attacker. We&#x27;ll use the npm package node-rate-limiter-flexible to count and limit the number of login attempts by key. Each key will have a points value that will count the number of failed login attempts. The keys will expire after a set amount of time. The key-value pairs will be stored in Redis, which is an open-source in-memory data structure store. It has many different use cases. We will use it as a simple database. Redis is simple to use and it is very fast. We&#x27;ll create an onlin…</span>

                    <span>This article was originally published a day earlier at https://maximorlov.com/send-a-file-with-axios-in-nodejs/
Programatically sending requests in Node.js can be a frustrating experience. First, you have to choose one out of many request libraries in the ecosystem. Second, they each have a slightly different API which is confusing when you&#x27;re switching.
You also have to make sure the request is formatted in a specific way for the 3rd party on the receiving end to accept it.
Just as you&#x27;re starting to get the hand of axios, you soon find out there are (subtle) usage differences depending on whether you&#x27;re in the browser or Node.js.
What a pain.
Only if sending files with axios in Node.js would be as easy as taking a walk in the park.
Well, it can be.

                    <span>In JavaScript, modules are pieces of encapsulated code that can reused in different parts of your application or program whenever you need it.
Basically you can write your JavaScript code without modules but breaking down your code into multiple reusable modules helps you to keep your code clean, readable, reusable and mode manageable when you have dependencies.
The syntax for modules was officially introduced in ES6. Let&#x27;s have a look at the various ways we can achieve this:
This method is used for the browser environments. Large web applications require many external modules. Now, the traditional way of loading them is using the  element. When using  the browser loads them in a synchronous(sequential) fashion. Now it would be much better if we can load those external modu…</span>

                    <span>A couple of months ago we covered Deno, a new JavaScript runtime that is attempting to dethrone Node.js as the de facto runtime for executing JavaScript. Ironically, Deno is being developed by Ryan Dahl, the same developer who made Node.js back in 2009. 
Here’s that article if you&#x27;re looking to learn more about our take on Deno:
https://codesphere.com/articles/say-yes-to-deno-23fa587e3877
While Deno has a lot to offer, such as built-in TypeScript support and a simpler dependency system, the biggest hurdle to its adoption is the plethora of dev tools and frameworks that are dependent on Node.js. As Deno gains traction, however, developers have begun creating new frameworks that rely on Deno instead of Node.js.

                    <span>In part 1 of this post, we have made a Twitter bot that greets followers and people who like our tweets but it was dependent on our local machine. So, in this post let&#x27;s get rid of it and push it on Heroku.
Heroku bestow the functionality to make a Node app a Worker which would run continuously as opposed to a Web app that would be put to sleep if not visited for a brief period of time.
Step-0: Make a Heroku app, then we can deploy the app using either Heroku CLI or attaching Github to it. Here, I am gonna use Heroku CLI.
Step-1: Add a Procfile to make our app a Worker. Simply make a file with the name Procfile add it to the root and add the following code in it:
worker: npm start

And modify the start script to &quot;start&quot;: &quot;node bot.js&quot;
Step-2: Push the app to heroku by following the steps: 
Install Git form here

Install Heroku CLI from here



  
  
  Commit your changes using Git




  cd myapp
  git init
  Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
  git add .
  git commit -m &quot;My first commit&quot;


Then create a Heroku app using heroku create twitter-bot-2021, this would also add a remote to you repository. Check the remote using git remote -v. This should show a Herko remote.


Now open the app by login in to the Heroku in order to put environment variables there as we cannot push .env file for security reasons.


Get the app URL by opening up the app using open app option from inside the app dashboard.


Then go to settings and click on Reveal Config Vars and insert the environment variables present in your .env file.


Now, finally deploy the code to Heroku using git push heroku master:main, if you are on the main branch in your local git repo then simply do git push heroku main.


Checkout these docs related to deployment in case you are stuck somewhere. 


Check the dashboard of the app, it should show a successful build in green.


Now, finally check the bot by following it form some other account, you should get the DM from the bot.

And you have done it.</span>

Ou como vamos retornar os dados que de fato são daquele usuário? Para isso precisamos de alguma coisa que prove que aquele usuário tem permissão para acessar determinada rota e que identifique quem é ele na nossa aplicação, para resolvermos esse problema vamos usar tokens! Nas nossas rotas vamos obrigar aquele usuário passar um token válido que só é dado no momento que é feito o login, e nesse token existe uma coisa chamada …</span>

To install, run and deploy the app, see this project&#x27;s docs:

To learn how to use this project and see how a React project works - see the About page of the template&#x27;s notes.

You&#x27;ll see imports are done like this:
import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import ReactDOM from &#x27;react-dom&#x27;;

That requires dependencies like react to be specified in package.json and installed using:
$ npm install

As per the Usage doc in the docs directory, use one of:
$ yarn start

$ npm start

This Node project is good for beginners in JavaScript who have little experience in React or Node and want to learn more.
Or, maybe you make a lot of React projects already but want to standardize your process. Or you want to add some docs and CI to your project and get it deployed to GitHub Pages.</span>

                    <span>There are a lot of builtin modules in Node.js. Most of us only use a few of them (I&#x27;m pretty sure the path, fs, and the server related modules are the most used ones). 
But one of the more overlooked modules is the util module. Here, I&#x27;m going to show you some of the helpful functions from this module.
util.callbackify(original)


I don&#x27;t think I will use this a lot because I love promises, but I think some people might love this.
Just like it&#x27;s name, it basically &quot;Takes an async function (or a function that returns a Promise) and returns a function following the error-first callback style, i.e. taking an (err, value) &#x3D;&gt; ... callback as the last argument&quot;

                    <span>Introduction


Rate limiting is a method used for controlling network traffic. It limits the number of actions a user can make per unit of time 1. In this tutorial, we will rate limit a login route to help protect it from brute force attacks. This limits the number of password guesses that can be made by an attacker. We&#x27;ll use the npm package node-rate-limiter-flexible to count and limit the number of login attempts by key. Each key will have a points value that will count the number of failed login attempts. The keys will expire after a set amount of time. The key-value pairs will be stored in Redis, which is an open-source in-memory data structure store. It has many different use cases. We will use it as a simple database. Redis is simple to use and it is very fast. We&#x27;ll create an onlin…</span>

                    <span>Often times it isn’t obvious whether an app or program features a dark mode. And it’s often an unassuming option buried in a menu somewhere.
But for those of you who are night owls, you’ll know that it works by reversing the usual color scheme of your windows putting light colored text on a dark background.
But it isn’t as simple as just Inverting the colors on a web page and calling it a day and you can see this if you have a browser extension that applies a dark mode as some elements on the page often. Don’t look as nice while other ones such as images won’t invert or dim properly.
So coding a good-looking dark mode that is specific to a certain website often requires a fair. A bit of finesse.
However, this often ends up being worth it as dark mode ends up delivering quite a few benefits…</span>

The Typeable Team appreciates security! We love Haskell, but is Haskell a good choice when secure software is the goal? We would love to say yes, but like most empirical questions about software development, there is simply no hard evidence that Haskell, or any general programming language, is more secure than any other. That is not to say that the Typeable&#x27;s language choice doesn&#x27;t matter in regards to security, but how it does may need to be elaborated.
After teaching introductory Software Security for half a decade I can attest that Software Security has no universal theory on which to rely.  Security is most often taught by enumerating different security issues, mitigations and security models and hoping that students can build from them to gain general understa…</span>

                    <span>The idea behind Encrypting your S3 object is that you upload objects onto Amazon S3 and these are servers of AWS so you may want to make sure that these objects are not accessible for example, if someone gets into the Amazon servers or you wanna make sure you get adhere to some security standards set up by your company. As such, Amazon gives you four methods to encrypt objects in Amazon S3. 
The first one is called SSE S3. This is to encrypt S3 objects, using keys handled and managed by AWS. 
The second one is SSE-KMS. It leverages AWS key management service to manage your encryption keys. 
The third one is SSE-C. It is used when you manage your own encryption keys.
Finally Client-side encryption.
Now we&#x27;re going to do a deep dive on all of those so don&#x27;t worry.

The last time I wanted to publish a npm package was in 2018. It was a React library which provided Components for creating Forms. It wasn’t straight forward to publish such a library back then. There were so many things to handle on your own, especially when it came to TypeScript.
Assuming you were already familiar with webpack you thought: ha that should be easy, I can leverage my knowledge and just bundle my library with webpack, exactly like my webapps. But then you suddenly heard of that new kid on the block: Rollup, which seems to do a better job at bundling libraries. So a new bundler you had to learn and still soo many things to take care of on your own.

Learning from React series:

Part 1 - why examining React is useful even if you won&#x27;t end up using it
Part 2 - what Facebook wanted to do with React and how to get a grasp on it
Part 3 (this one) - what is Reactive Programming all about?
The name React is already declaring that it is used in reactive programming, but what is that? Wikipedia is defining it as &quot;a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change&quot;. It expands on that to say that it declares the relationship between elements and updates them when either change. You can easily imagine a graph of elements magically updating as any of them changes. However, the implementation details of that magic matter.

In one of the applications that I&#x27;m working on, I have to calculate what is a previous month of a given date. It seems easy, isn&#x27;t it? Golang provides the time package which has a method: AddDate.  
I&#x27;m quite fresh in Go, previously I was working with C#, Python and (for some time) TypeScript. Every one of these languages has also some methods to calculate time. Let&#x27;s see how they work.

A Typed Array is an array that can only hold a specific amount of bit per item.

01000001 -&gt; 65

The Typed Array that can hold 8 bit positive integers is called a Uint8Array.

This article is targeted to beginning-to-intermediate-level Angular developers wishing to obtain insight into methods for state management in front-end applications. A simple, but highly customizable, reactive state-management service is constructed on top of the RxJs BehaviorSubject. This approach can be used for both management of a global store or as model manager for a lazy-loaded route. Both use cases are illustrated through an Angular version 8 application.
While the code in this application may be extended for practical use in your own applications, there is another motivation for studying the internals of state management.

This library introduces an execution context that removes a lot of the ceremony needed to wire and orchestrate Angular components. It provides a layer of abstraction on top of existing Angular constructs, such as lifecycle hooks, change detection, queries, host bindings and host listeners. It embraces the power of RxJS with composable subscriptions. Angular Composition API is designed to feel native to the Angular developer.

Basically you can write your JavaScript code without modules but breaking down your code into multiple reusable modules helps you to keep your code clean, readable, reusable and mode manageable when you have dependencies.
The syntax for modules was officially introduced in ES6. Let&#x27;s have a look at the various ways we can achieve this:

At Supermetrics one error-handling approach we take is to encode error states into the TypeScript type system. What does this mean? Simply, I’m referring to code where the semantic property of &quot;being an error&quot; is indicated by a variable&#x27;s type. For a simplified example:
// No information in the type that this is an error,
// you would have to inspect the value to check
let firstError: string &#x3D; &quot;Something terrible occurred&quot;;

interface TerribleError {
  code: &quot;TERRIBLE_ERROR&quot;;
  message: string;
}

// It is clearly indicated in the type that …</span>

                    <span>TLDR:


Don&#x27;t vendor lock yourself with unsupported experimental syntax and
reflect-metadata which forces you to pre-process your runtime code.
Use raw vanilla Javascript and infer Typescript data types directly from the Javascript definitions.
const userModel &#x3D; model({
  id: nonNullable(stringType())
  name: nonNullable(stringType())
})

@Model()
class userModel 
  @Field()
  id: string

  @Field()
  name: string
}

First of all we need to know Typescript decorators API.
Decorators are syntax sugar which gives us the option to write quasi high-order-functions to enhance classes, methods, and properties.

  Intro 


Continuing on from my previous blog about website security week, we&#x27;re going to talk about a validation.
If accept user input, you are going to need to validate the input. Non validated user inputs can lead to security vulnerabilities for example SQL injection attacks, where user input escapes your database and starts modifying it. It can also lead to exceptions from your code if a user inputs text rather than a number for example.
Please Please Please ensure you do the same validation server side as you do on the frontend (client) side.



You user inputs should be contained in HTML forms which comes with lots of powerful validation tools built in.
First thing to check on your inputs is, are you using the correc…</span>

Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a digital system for recording the transaction of assets in which the transactions and their details are recorded in multiple places at the same time. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have no central data store or administration functionality.
Instead, a distributed network of nodes maintains a public record of all transactions between them. In a blockchain, transactions are made on a record called a &quot;block&quot; that is updated by the distributed public ledger</span>

                    <span>Before we start, you need to be conversant with the python programming language, it is what we are going to use in this tutorial. Let’s get started.
We are going to use the keyboard module for the keylogger.  To install it, open your terminal type in pip install keyboard. If no error occured, you are good to go.
After that, open a new python file and let&#x27;s start coding 🕶️
import keyboard #The keyboard module

def logger(event):
    print(event.name)

keyboard.on_press(logger)
keyboard.wait()

I can say we are done, maybe above 50% done. Let me explain the code; on the first line, we imported the keyboard module. Then we defined our logger(event) function, it takes event as parameter and then it print&#x27;s it&#x27;s .name out. Then to the next line, we assigned the logger function as a parameter t…</span>

By the design itself Azure signalr service has a public endpoint that is accessible through the internet, and it currently does not support deploying directly into a virtual network and allowing IP address because of this you cannot leverage certain networking features with the offering&#x27;s resources such as network security groups, route tables, or other network dependent appliances such as an Azure Firewall. 
However, it allows you to create private endpoints to secure the traffic between resources in your virtual network and Azure SignalR Service.

                    <span>A Complete Zero-to-Hero guide in setting up a CI/CD Pipeline using Gitlab-CI to deploy with the help of Azure Storage



For the purpose of this demo, I have already created a simple Angular 7 application that is hosted on Gitlab, the application is a simple, digital clock that looks something like this.


The above diagram describes the whole process, right from a developer pushing the code, to the point where the CI/CD Pipeline builds &amp; deploys the code to Azure Storage (Blob) which is linked to Azure CDN Endpoint.
Developer goes ahead and performs the development locally of the application after which he goes ahead and commits and pushes the code to the version control system in our case it’s Gitlab.


We would then have Gitlab perform the CI/CD in the form of the steps mentioned in git…</span>

Here is a short explanation, but be aware these are generic names inspired by old western movies!
Hackers are of all kinds, genders, and ages. Forget about the hoodie, the darkroom, and the need for recognition. Not that the cliché never happens, but remember it&#x27;s a stereotype.
Anyway, not all hackers are cybercriminals. White hats or &quot;ethical hackers&quot; use their skills to test and ultimately improve security for various organizations and people. For example, banks and medical services can be involved.
They use the same techniques as gray and black hats to infiltrate systems. Black hats are known for their dark intentions. I would describe gray hats as &quot;not always ethical hackers.&quot; Sometimes, they do illegal stuff.

                    <span>gpg is a program to encrypt and decrypt files. In other words, it is a program for privacy and security.
Your data is safe if you store it on gpg (i.e. encrypted).
So why would you expose your secret information to the threat of being stolen by leaking it to a computer disk?
The only reason is ignorance, because encryption is easy and saves you effort and money in the long run.
Tools like gpg make encryption as easy as saving a file, or even easier.
gpg linux will help you encrypt your e-mails or to encrypt files on your disk so that nobody else can read them without knowing the decryption password which you alone know.

However, with this comes the need to add some form of authentication in front of all your services. For example, you probably don&#x27;t want just anyone to be able to view all your RSS feeds, or use your markdown editor freely!
The most basic form is HTTP Basic Authentication, which is a pain as it must be configured and re-entered for each subdomain/service. You also need to type it out for each service, which can be challenging on mobile.
Single Sign On (SSO) on the other hand allows you to authenticate with different services with a single login. For example, if you have a Google account, you can go to youtube.com, gmail.co…</span>

                    <span>No, upgrading to Angular 12.x.x will not help.
The Typescript experimental decorators were based on TC39 proposal-decorators.
We use the same Decorators in our Angular codebase to create services, components and other Angular constructs.
But the same TC39 proposal has evolved in a different direction which is semantically not compatible with the experimental Typescript decorators.   
The new spec for Decorators is easier to use and write.
You can find the detailed comparison between old and new decorators here. 
Just finished up the first draft of the new decorators spec, pretty excited about it 😄 https://t.co/ELhZbsiaiR

Does this mean that Typescript experimental decorators will not be compatible with Javascript decorators 😨
— Shivam (@shivamd20

Unfortunately no, the new proposal has differing semantics from previous proposals in a number of ways. TypeScript experimental decorators were also incompatible with the Define semantics class fields, which caused a decent amount of breakage in the ecosystem.

When the proposal advances, figuring out a step-by-step incremental upgrade path for existing decorators users is definitely going to be a priority though! No user left behind 😄

Let&#x27;s just hope that this doesn’t result in fragmentation of JavaScript decorators. We have already faced a lot inconvenience due to commonsjs and ES6 imports.</span>

I wanted to something fun for the holiday season, so I decided to port a variable-width stroke from the Flex Freehand Drawing Library I created back in the early 2010’s. This stroke actually has a venerable history, going back to about 1983, as an exercise I was assigned as a teaching assistant for a graduate course in computational geometry. The instructor’s company recently obtained a very expensive tablet. This system allowed users to scan or load drawings already in electronic form into a display and annotate them with hand-drawn notes using a fixed-width stroke. The instructor had an idea for a variable-width (speed-dependent) stroke that would be the basis for a number of lab exercises. My job was to get his idea working in Fortran (yes, now you ca…</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>
