                    <span>So during this past week of October, Hacktoberfest started and I&#x27;ve been trying to get started with some PRs. This is my first time participating Hacktoberfest and I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect. It&#x27;s very intimidating for me to see so many huge projects that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m experienced enough to help with, and try to find something in them to help fix or add to. So I wanted to start with something maybe smaller and work my way up to a larger project I am interested in.
It felt a lot harder to find something simple than I expected it to be, there were a lot of cool projects that looked very complicated and I wasn&#x27;t really sure how to solve their issues. It really helped that my professor taught us how to use GitHub&#x27;s search features to find specific labels such as the &quot;good firs‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Um dos grandes problemas que enfrentei ao atualizar o frontend de aplica√ß√µes angular foi o cache. 
Praticamente todos os navegadores mant√™m um cache da aplica√ß√£o no computador do cliente para conseguir carregar a aplica√ß√£o de forma mais r√°pida e com menor consumo de dados e isso √© excelente. Entretanto, um efeito colateral √© que as atualiza√ß√µes podem demorar para serem entregues para o cliente. Como consequ√™ncia, o cliente pode ficar horas ou dias com uma vers√£o com um bug que j√° foi corrigido.
Em sistemas internos de empresas, isso pode resultar em liga√ß√µes ou tickets constantes para a equipe de suporte t√©cnico, causando uma sobrecarga na equipe. Quando estamos falando de aplica√ß√µes fornecidas para clientes externos √† empresa, pode ser um ponto de frustra√ß√£o e insatisfa√ß√£o com o produto.

                    <span>Introduction


Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
ngx-spinner is a loading (spinner) component library with more than 50 different types.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the application with the Angular base structure using the @angular/cli with the route file and the SCSS style format.
ng new angular-spinner
? Would you like to add Angular routing? Yes
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? SCSS   [ https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss                ]

  What is CRUD?



Create, Read, Update, and Delete üëâ CRUD
Starting from the acronym, CRUD means create, read, update, and delete. These are the four main functionalities that must be provided by all models when building APIs.
Firstly let&#x27;s explain some basics... An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. It&#x27;s the main contract between frontend and backend regarding their communication. An API in order to be RESTful, it should fo‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Angular has the concept of services which allows to share the data between components.
In this blog we will learn about service instances creation in Angular.
What happens when we inject service in root of a lazy module, is the same instance used for multiple lazy modules.
What if we want to have a separate instance per module and per component ?
We will use the same code example as used in common chunks example. If you haven&#x27;t gone through that blog do checkout to learn on why common chunks are created.
Let&#x27;s begin then.
Let&#x27;s start where we ended in the previous post. We have two lazy modules user and account and currently share the same toast module which is built in a separate chunk.
As we have given as @Injectable({ providedIn: &quot;root&quot; }) for the toast service, a singleton instance of ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>When you are using AWS, there are times when you have to worry about the price.
However, I wondered if this was true, so I tested the theory that AWS&#x27; Northern Virginia region (us-east-1) is not necessarily the least expensive.
There were a few services that did not have the lowest rates in the Northern Virginia region (us-east-1) of AWS.
I have the impression that the AWS tariffs are not very specific about comparing regions.

                    <span>What is Wordpress?


WordPress is the simplest, most popular way to create your own website or blog. In fact, WordPress powers over 40.0% of all the websites on the Internet. Yes ‚Äì more than one in four websites that you visit are likely powered by WordPress!
To begin go to the AWS Control Panel and find the search bar. 
Lightsail and click the first service. Now you should see something like the following:

Create instance. Now scroll down and you will see Lightsail by default selected Wordpress. 
$5/month deal. Name your instance and then press the big button saying Create instance. Now wait 3 minutes for your VM (Instance) to load up. To know it is loaded up you will see the Wordpress icon blue and not gray. 
13.59.157.149. Once copied go to your broswer and paste it in with the following line:
13.59.157.149/wp-admin

You should see the following:

user is user but to find the password we need to go back to the terminal.
cat bitnami_application_password

Select the output and paste it into the password. Once you logged in you are done! You should see the following once logged in:

The goal is to create an application that will implement CRUD operations in Node.js using the Express.js framework and SQLite database, using the MVC design pattern. It will be a simple To Do List Application in which the user can Create, Read, Update and Delete a task.
The application is available on the following link To Do Application, and the complete code is available on the GitHub repository.
Getting started
Template engine
Routes
Database
MVC architectural pattern
More setup
Create task
Delete and update task
Data validation
Conclusion
The first step is to create a new directory and initialize the project using a terminal.

I have a beginner friendly backend requirement. 
It will be simple CRUD of three resources.


Data will be stored to DynamoDB.


For language, you can use golang or node.


All code you write will be open source under GPL. 


Our repositories are participating in Hatoberfest.



The project: simplq.me is an open source queue management software. The backend is written in Springboot and we want to migrate it to serverless as it&#x27;s more economic given our traffic volume.

Node.js is lightweight when contrasted with different adversaries that make it very proficient for the advancement of information escalated huge scope applications, for example, video web-based locales, and other web applications. 

Node.js is very like Ruby&#x27;s EventMachine and Python&#x27;s Twisted yet a stride in front of them. It has an occasion-driven design that has the ability of nonconcurrent I/O tasks, which makes it equipped for dealing with numerous simultaneous solicitations. 
One of the principal up-sides of Node.js which makes it more famous is that it runs on different stages like Windows, Linux, macOS, Unix, and some more.

                    <span>On most of the company websites, you will find locations or contacts page that displays that company location in that country or state in a google map along with the company address.
This is a pretty common requirement even for food or hotel business-related websites.
So in this article, we will see how to add a google map with the preferred location on your website.
Create a new folder with the name google-map-location-demo and create an index.html file inside it. Now, type ! (exclamation mark) in the file and press tab, so the default HTML code will automatically be added by emmet.
If you&#x27;re not aware of emmet and its useful shortcuts, check out my this article.

You can change the title tag content as per your choice.
For this demo, we will show the Eiffel tower&#x27;s location on the map.
So follow the below steps.
Navigate to https://maps.google.com/ and search for Eiffel Tower in the search box
Now, click on the Share icon and select the Embed a map option
Click on the COPY HTML button to copy the iframe tag into your clipboard
Now, open the index.html file, and inside the body tag, add the copied content

Now, If you open the file in the browser, you will see the map displayed

Actually, I already felt tired of entering each command separately every time I run ssg, and personally I was thinking similar to lab4, so I really liked this requirement and felt good.

A software bug is an error in a computer program that causes it to produce unexpected results or to behave in a disruptive fashion.
Albeit a bug can be a very innocent flaw, a careless mistake the impact it can have can still be exponentially larger than an exploit due to a big logical error in a code base.
eg. a small rounding error in the calculation of an orbit of a satellite can cause major financial damages with many other implications like space pollution.
Hence, every developer should be aware of basic cybersecurity practices!

When you start working as an application security engineer, you&#x27;ll expect to find straightforward tasks to do. But this is not the case because each company has its vision and strategies to handle data security, which can let us infer that every organization&#x27;s security maturity may differ from one to another.
Viewing data breaches and cyber incidents all the time proves that no one out there has a mature cyber security program.
If you are already working in this field, I imagine that you sometimes feel that you&#x27;re achieving nothing and you are more invisible inside the organization. The bigest challenge I see is how to increase your visibility and have more transparency with your manager and the rest of your co-workers.

                    <span>A security operations center, known as a SOC ‚Äì pronounced ‚Äúsock‚Äù üß¶ - is a team of experts that proactively monitor an organization‚Äôs ability to operate securely.
Members of a SOC team are responsible for a variety of activities, including proactive monitoring, incident response and recovery, remediation activities, compliance, and coordination and context.
Proactive Monitoring
Incident Response and Recovery
For example, that recovery can include activities such as handling acute malware or ransomware incidents. 
Remediation Activities 
For Example, using information obtained from log files and other sources, a SOC member can recommend a better network segmentation strategy or a better system patching regimen. Improving existing CyberSecurity is a major responsibility of a SOC. 
Compliance
Organisation secure themselves through conformity to a security policy, as well as external security standards, such as ISO 27001x, the NIST CyberSecurity Framework(CSF) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Organisations need a SOC to help ensure that they are compliant with an important security standards and best practices. 
Coordination and Context
Above all, a SOC team member helps an organisation coordinate desperate elements and services and provide visualized, useful information. Part of this coordination is the ability to provide a helpful, useful set of narratives for activities on the network. These narratives help shape a company&#x27;s CyberSecurity policy and posture for the future.</span>

This guide is exactly about that. We‚Äôll be securing an API written using Ruby On Rails, with Auth0 as the authorization server.
There‚Äôs a repository with the code so that you can follow along in Github.
I didn‚Äôt explain what I mean by securing an API yet. Essentially, we‚Äôre ensuring that protected routes are accessible only for the users with enough rights.

A linked list is a linear data structure that represents a collection of elements that we&#x27;ll call nodes , where each node points to the next one or previous one, the first node in the linked list is the head and the last is the tail

In the linked list each node must be have the following properties:
The main properties of the linked list are:
Size: The number of nodes in the linked list 
Head: The first node
Tail: The last node
and the main operations of a linked list data structure are: 
insertAt: Inserts a node at the specific index.


removeAt: Removes the node at the specific index.


getAt: Retrieves the element at the specific index.


Clear: Empties the linked list


Reverse(in this case): Reverses the order of nodes in the linked list

                    <span>Um dos grandes problemas que enfrentei ao atualizar o frontend de aplica√ß√µes angular foi o cache. 
Praticamente todos os navegadores mant√™m um cache da aplica√ß√£o no computador do cliente para conseguir carregar a aplica√ß√£o de forma mais r√°pida e com menor consumo de dados e isso √© excelente. Entretanto, um efeito colateral √© que as atualiza√ß√µes podem demorar para serem entregues para o cliente. Como consequ√™ncia, o cliente pode ficar horas ou dias com uma vers√£o com um bug que j√° foi corrigido.
Em sistemas internos de empresas, isso pode resultar em liga√ß√µes ou tickets constantes para a equipe de suporte t√©cnico, causando uma sobrecarga na equipe. Quando estamos falando de aplica√ß√µes fornecidas para clientes externos √† empresa, pode ser um ponto de frustra√ß√£o e insatisfa√ß√£o com o produto.

I have only added &quot;readonly&quot; into Array type before.
So I will try &quot;readonly&quot; in this time.
Node.js ver.16.10.0
TypeScript ver.4.4.3
I can set array as readonly.
const readonlyTexts: readonly string[] &#x3D; [];

I can use it as declaration, arguments, return value, and so on.
const mutableTexts: string[] &#x3D; [];
// OK
mutableTexts.push(&#x27;Hello&#x27;);

const readonlyTexts: readonly string[] &#x3D; [];
// compile error
readonlyTexts.push(&#x27;Hello&#x27;);

In TypeScript world, readonly array and default array are separated.
function init(): void {
    const mutableTexts: string[] &#x3D; [];
    // OK
    mutableTexts.push(&#x27;Hello&#x27;);
    // OK
    editArrayValue(mutableTexts);

    const readonlyTexts: readonly string[] &#x3D; [];

    editArrayValue(readonlyTexts);    
}

We demonstrated how we can importing individual files and functions from larger libraries without the need to carry along code we aren&#x27;t using.
This tutorial introduces you to source maps, webpack&#x27;s DevServer, as well as how to introduce both React and Typescript into a webpack project.

Recently I found here on dev.to one article talking about the usage of TS generics on React components. As you may notice, I&#x27;ve been working with TS since quite a while, and the first thing that I tried to work with in React was generics, because they are an amazing feature that allows us, component creators, to give some control over the types to end users, component consumers. Maybe we are both, maybe we are one, but no the other. In any way, a good typed component will always help.
But that article wasn&#x27;t accurate, and it was uncompleted, so if someone else would read it, they will end up with misinformation. And I understand, we all are learning here, we all do mistakes, and that&#x27;s not as important as it is for we to learn. So, I&#x27;m going to show you w‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>This guide is to help you understand the concept of pagination and how to implement it in react, the concepts in this tutorial can be applied to any javascript project.
Pagination is the process of separating print or digital content into discrete pages. For print documents and some online content, pagination also refers to the automated process of adding consecutive numbers to identify the sequential order of pages.

Let&#x27;s say you have a total of 6 items on a page, and you want to only display 3 items at a time (per page). This means we are going to have a total of 2 pages, and if we want to display 2 items per page this means a total of?? you guessed it! 3 pages.

Serverless computing is an architecture that allows developers to deploy code without provisioning and maintaining the backend infrastructure to support it. By abstracting servers, it allows us to focus on the code that we write and think less about hardware.
There are many serverless solutions from cloud computing providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. In this tutorial, I&#x27;ll show you how to create a serverless function with Azure Functions that&#x27;s triggered with an HTTP request.

  All codes for this blog can be found from src/Basic/_2.ts file





let obj &#x3D; {x: 0};
obj.bar &#x3D; &#x27;Hello&#x27;;

This will show a editor error in TS
Property &#x27;bar&#x27; does not exist on type &#x27;{ x: number; }&#x27;;

This is like TS saying &quot;i can see obj has only one property x of type number,but you are changing &quot;bar&quot; which is not a property of obj hence i am going to show error&quot;.
let obj:{x: number, bar?: string}&#x3D; {x: 0};
obj.bar &#x3D; &#x27;Hello&#x27;;

Here, &quot;?&quot; means optional. This will run fine now.
function greet(name: string){
    console.log(&#x27;Hello &#x27;+name.toUpperCase()+&#x27;!&#x27;);
}

//greet(42);  //throws error

Now to figure out how to approach it. 
As I was figuring out how I wanted to work on this, my mind was on simple and to the point as we just want to create the file client-side. I found https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-saver to which suits my needs. Now all that&#x27;s left is to implement the exportCSV function. 
In my typescript file,  I added the following:
 exportFile(data: any) {
    const replacer &#x3D; (key, value) &#x3D;&gt; value &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; null ? &#x27;&#x27; : value;

Reactive Extensions of JavaScript is a library for reactive programming. It is commonly known for its operators. The RxJS Operators are also known as Observable Operators.
What are Operators?
Operators are pure functions. They take observable as input and return output as observable.
map‚Äì a transformation operator works similar to Array.prototype.map
switchMap‚Äì cancels the inner observable when outer observable emits a value
catchError‚Äì catches the error and passes to error handling function
debounceTime‚Äì discards values if emitted in less than specified time
takeUntil‚Äì automatically unsubscribes from an observable
distinctUntilChanged‚Äì emits only distinct values and duplicate‚Ä¶</span>

RxJS is Reactive Extensions of JavaScript. It is a library to work with Observables which make developers life easier. RxJS provides various operators to work with in Angular. In this article we will discuss about RxJS Observable forkJoin operator, its definition, real world uses, error handling, is it deprecated etc.
What is RxJS forkJoin
Is it deprecated ?
I will explain what I mean!
Initially forkJoin was accepting object arguments as rest parameter. That is deprecated and no longer used.
Now they updated the operator and ask to provide array of observables instead of object arguments. As the line itself saying in above screenshot- @deprecated

When you changed a lot it is hard to find a starting point. What you can do about this? You already read the title so you know the answer. Tldr; just try it.
The console.log() function is something most JS developers know, you can output anything to the console (for Node as well as the browser). I think a lot of developers do not know about console.time() though. Probably something you will use a lot less, but can be very useful.
Okay, so let‚Äôs find that slow little bastard of a function. What you need to know:
console.time(‚Äòexample‚Äô) will start a timer, where you also give it a name. You can start multiple timers (simultaneously), if choose di‚Ä¶</span>

After much research and deliberation, I&#x27;ve concluded the best way for me to achieve this is to separate my local hardware from the software which will run on it. Essentially, I&#x27;ll be treating my hardware as a &quot;local cloud&quot;, and create VM Images that I will deploy running my application stack. (Azure Stack HCI has the right idea here!)
When developing and testing on cloud providers, they always have a base image available to use as a starting off point. Not so for my local cloud!

There was a pressing need for organizations to transition into a new operating model to be able to thrive. A complete shift to virtual working and protecting sensitive data were at the crux of this model. Virtual working entails cloud computing which as a result entails the risk of security breaches and sensitive information being leaked or deleted. This is precisely what Microsoft recently warned its customers about.

                    <span>Part II


In Part I, we created nestjs project and created a database and then integrated Mikro-Orm. In this part we are going to create entities and start writing APIs.
We are first going to start with User module. We are going to structure our project like user folder will contain controller, service, repository, entities of it&#x27;s own and after this module is completed we are going to export this module to our main module i.e. &quot;app.module.ts file&quot;.
Now, let&#x27;s create a folder &quot;entities&quot; which will contain all the entities related to user. 
Here we used @Entity to define an entity. The entity contains many properties and these properties can be defined with either @Property(), @ManyToOne(), @OneToMany(), etc. These are known as decorators, to know more about these checkout out Decorator Ref‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve talked a good deal about observability, tracing and instrumentation in the past. Recently, I decided to try out some new things in those areas, and here&#x27;s how it went.
In my app Tentacle, there&#x27;s an internal Node.js API which is called by the main app from time to time. This API in turn calls other external services, often more than once, and it can take anywhere from one to ten seconds for the whole thing to end, depending on the external services. I wanted to see how I could improve speed. Yes, the external service might be slow, but perhaps there was some way I could improve things on my end‚Äîbetter configuration, improved logic in handling the response, parallelization? I decided to add tracing so I could see if there were bottlenecks I could fix.

                    <span>I&#x27;m learning Node JS so I thought it&#x27;d be better to make some projects which will help me understand Node JS better. So I did.
If you&#x27;ve worked with React or Vue, you might have came across this situation where your app needs a lot of components and you have to create them all manually. It&#x27;s a pain, right? So I thought why not make it a little easier. And I did. (Hopefully).

Batizada de Mariana Trench (MT) e distribuida de forma Open Source a ferramenta est√° em constante evolu√ß√£o e suporte pelo time de engenharia do Facebook. Ela √© usada hoje em milh√µes de linhas de c√≥digo no Whatsapp, Instagram e, claro, no pr√≥prio app do Facebook. Segundo o Facebook, na primeira metade de 2021, 50% das vulnerabilidades encontradas foram de forma automatizada.
O MT foi desenvolvido em Python e roda de forma est√°tica no c√≥digo. Est√° dispon√≠vel (aqui)[https://github.com/facebook/mariana-trench/). O Facebook tamb√©m deixou pronto um tutorial para facilitar nos primeiros passos. O tutorial pode ser acessado (aqui)[https://mariana-tren.ch/docs/getting-started/].</span>

In this article, we see how Doppler can help us to simply and quickly manage environment variables for a complex system called Open edX. 
Open edX is an open-source platform you can use to create and host online courses. It was originally developed in 2012 by MIT and Harvard University and has since been adopted by organizations of all shapes and sizes to power a wide range of online learning use cases.
We use Ansible to provision and maintain our platform. If you are not familiar with Ansible, it&#x27;s an open source Devops tool that automates the software provisioning and configuration. It building blocks are:

Se pensarmos em frameworks e sua curva de aprendizado, podemos dizer que Vue √© um framework relativamente f√°cil de aprender, seguido de ReactJS (que tecnicamente √© uma lib), e depois vem o Angular. Ent√£o por que eu aprenderia Angular e n√£o outro framework?
Angular √© um framework bem completinho. Ele vem com algumas bibliotecas j√° inclu√≠das, como router e http, por exemplo. Ele tem Typescript integrado, mas voc√™ n√£o precisa escrever em Typescript se n√£o quiser. ‚Ä¶</span>

The problem with me is I have an interest based learning, if the project doesn&#x27;t interest me I won&#x27;t be able to go ahead with it. So I decided to update my portfolio! but using Continuous deployment, podman and Argo tunnels!
Gitlab Runner Setup using podman
Cloudflared tunnel setup using systemd
Continuous deployment using Gitlab CI/CD using containers!!
Running a completely rootless setup
Lets get started with cloudflared installation and setup.

Part 0 briefly explained the clone syscall. It&#x27;s like fork/vfork, but with more options to control the child process. Actually, some implementations of fork propagate the call to clone().
Besides controlling which parts of the execution context get shared from the parent process, the clone call offers the possibility for us to create a separate memory block for the child&#x27;s stack. The nix implementation of clone has the following signature:
pub fn clone(
 cb: CloneCb, 
 stack: &amp;mut [u8], 
 flags: CloneFlags, 
 signal: Option
) -&gt; Result

                    <span>I have always wanted to access private servers (accessed only through VPN or SSH tunnels) through domains without going through the hassle of locally modifying hosts files in the client side (me and my colleagues) or the SSH config files, so here&#x27;s my attempt to solve this problem.
I used a t3a.nano AWS EC2 instance to demonstrate the idea with Ubuntu 20.04 on it, with OpenVPN as my VPN server and dnsmasq as a DNS server.
I used dnsmasq instead of something like BIND because it&#x27;s much easier to setup and maintain. 
This was made only for demonstration purpose, so to quickly setting up an OpenVPN server without pain I used angristan/openvpn-install script to do so.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angristan/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh

                    <span>Transferring files to servers is a vital task in most software developers&#x27; life. Usually, we use protocols like FTP (File Transfer Protocol), FTPS, SFTP to transfer files. In this tutorial, we are going to briefly discuss the available protocols and their differences. Also, the tutorial will explain how to transfer files from client to server, server to client and server to server using SCP.
FTP is an old and insecure protocol that can be used to transfer files between local networks or computers connected through the Internet. However, FTP is not recommended to use to transfer files over the Internet anymore as it transfers usernames and passwords in cleartext. In addition to that, FTP provides an anonymous method that let you transfer files even without a username and password.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve slowly adding more and more lua functions into my neovim configuration,





  
  
  Telegraph.nvim


Check out the project readme
I want a simple way to make remaps into shell commands that can open new tmux
For example I want to make remaps to do things like open the current file in lookatme.
# vim :terminal
nnoremap s Telegraph pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark

# tmux session
nnoremap s lua require&#x27;telegraph&#x27;.telegraph({cmd&#x3D;&#x27;pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark&#x27;, how&#x3D;&#x27;tmux&#x27;})

# tmux popup
nnoremap S lua require&#x27;telegraph&#x27;.telegraph({cmd&#x3D;&#x27;pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark&#x27;, how&#x3D;&#x27;tmux_popup&#x27;})

The main goal here is that remaps become one liners that can just be put
init.vim without creating a whole new lua module for each
telegraph takes in a how argument to determine where to tun the command.j
term(default) runs command in the built in terminal
tmux runs command in a new tmux session and joins it.
tmux_popup runs command in a tmux popup window.
tmux_popup_session runs command in a tmux session and displays it in a popup
subprocess runs command in a subprocess
The current set of format strings that can be used with telegraph.  Placing
{} within your command will get rendered into something with
cword - the current word under the cursor
cWORD - the current BIG Word under the cursor
cline - the current line under the cursor
filepath - the filepath of the current file
filename - the filename of the current file
parent - the parent directory of the current file
current_session_name - name of the current tmux session
cwd - the current working directory
Check out the repo and give
it a star if its something that interests you.</span>

What&#x27;s so special in this distribution?
Just Open the Box. Calinix is Arch, but not necessarily as hard as Arch Installation. Calinix comes with various packages, modern interface and a calamares installer out of the box


Arch without Hassle. Yes, it&#x27;s based on pure Arch with no custom package control, making your distribution rolling release, reliable and have infinite possibilities


Community Support. Facing a problem? The official developers along with other friendly people of the community await you in the reddit, discord server and forum. We highly care for our community and like to help them in each way we can.


The &quot;Power User&quot; kind-of desktop. With Vim, awesomeWM, Rofi and many other features, Calinix is a perfect choice for the linux &quot;power users&quot;, with perfection! Though it shares it&#x27;s looks with MacOSX, it is a lot more keyboard centric than MacOS
