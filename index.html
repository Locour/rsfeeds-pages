We will use the default themes that Angular Material offers and will see what setup is required in your Angular solution while using Angular Material.
We will make changes to the App.Module.Ts file and then use the Angular Material component in the template and component.

                    <span>A backend for frontend (BFF) is one of these newer architectural patterns that especially became relevant after the rise of microservices and domain-driven design, as it is a way to simplify the communication between the frontend and backend and make the frontend development simpler.
In this post, I will cover BFFs with Angular and if and how you should do it in your project.

                    <span>Problem


So, you have an angular material component, say a chip or a button like so:
 Done button&gt;

The designs provided to you show that the background colour of the button should be green and the text should be white.
In your corresponding styling file (.css or .scss), include the following style selector:
.mat-green {
 background-color: green;
 color: white;
}

And then, in your .html file, simply set the color input attribute to green as below:
 Done button&gt;

And voilà ! There you have it.
Note: You can provide any name to the css selector and prefix it with mat- and set the name to the color attribute.</span>

If you’re just entering the world of development, one of the first things you will likely notice is how much jargon there is. I know when I first started, it felt like there was at least one word in every sentence that I had never heard before. Like any field, there is very specific jargon related to the field of development. With coding, there is specific jargon for different types of programming as well as jargon that is unique to specific languages, libraries, and frameworks. 
I know I&#x27;ve looked up what words mean only to be more confused after reading the definition. It can all feel a little daunting to start, so our goal in this post is to introduce some of the broader and more commonly used terms in coding to help get you starte…</span>

As you know that a login form is used to enter authentication credentials to access a restricted page or form. The login form contains a field for the username and another for the password. When the login form is submitted its underlying code checks that the credentials are authentic, giving the user can access the restricted page.
As you know that sign-up forms are an integral part of any website. Depending on the nature of your business, sign-up forms can be used for generating leads, collecting emails for your newsletter, and acquiring new customers. ... A sign-up form is…</span>

How to create a docker-compose.yml file.
Automate building images and environment variables.
Orchestrate and communicate docker-compose. (Adding ports, volumes, and networks)
Troubleshooting with Container logs and shells.

                    <span>There&#x27;s more to developing a website than throwing some HTML and back-end code together. An important consideration that is often overlooked, is how a website gets rendered and delivered to users. This can make or break the experience users have, and even severely influence a website&#x27;s rankings in search engines.
In this article we&#x27;ll be taking a look at 3 different approaches to rendering websites with dynamic content, alongside their pros and cons
Currently the most popular approach when it comes to web applications. Client-site rendering means the client (our user&#x27;s browser) is responsible for rendering the dynamic parts of our website by leveraging JavaScript and a separate back-end API.
React, Angular, Vue, JQuery, ... are mostly used for this approach.

                    <span>Rebasing e mesclagem são projetados para integrar as alterações de um branch em outro, mas de maneiras diferentes.
Por ex. digamos que temos commits como abaixo, o merge resultará como uma combinação de commits, enquanto o rebase adicionará todas as mudanças no branch de recurso a partir do último commit do branch master:

Quando você rebase um branch de recurso no master, você move a base do branch de recurso para o ponto final do branch master.
O marge pega o conteúdo da ramificação do recurso e o integra à ramificação mestre. Como resultado, apenas o branch master é alterado. O histórico de ramificações de recursos permanece o mesmo.
A marge adiciona um novo compromisso ao seu histórico.
As confirmações serão semelhantes a:

Quando rebase? Quando marge?
Se o branch de recurso do qual você está obtendo mudanças for compartilhado com outros desenvolvedores, o rebase não é recomendado, porque o processo de rebase criará repositórios inconsistentes. Para indivíduos, o rebasing faz muito sentido.
Se você quiser ver o histórico completamente igual ao que aconteceu, você deve usar marge. Merge preserva o histórico enquanto rebase o reescreve.
Rebase é melhor para agilizar um histórico complexo, você pode alterar o histórico de commits por rebase interativo . Você pode remover commits indesejados, esmagar dois ou mais commits em um ou editar a mensagem de commit.
Rebase apresentará conflitos, um commit por vez, enquanto que merge os apresentará todos de uma vez. É melhor e muito mais fácil lidar com os conflitos, mas você não deve esquecer que reverter um rebase é muito mais difícil do que reverter uma fusão se houver muitos conflitos.</span>

Let&#x27;s see how this can bring benefits to our release and team workflow processes. This is an example from my personal experience.
Usual Workflow
Currently, QA and product reviews are tightly coupled to releases and it&#x27;s often hard to roll back changes once they&#x27;re in the release itself.

New Workflow

                    <span>One of the core principles to DevOps and SRE is a skill that a lot of new engineers are losing, which is the understanding of systems (servers, for example) and operating systems. Not too long ago, as an engineer, you had to understand how to install Linux. You needed to know how to dedicate storage to the OS, mount volumes, install the operating system itself, and configure the operating system.
Now, things are slightly different ever since we started living in a cloudy world. Getting a system up and running is as easy as logging into a cloud portal and clicking a few buttons. 
The problem with not knowing about operating systems is; regardless how much abstraction there is, systems are still needed. For example, a Docker container is running a flavor of Linux or a version of Windows. You…</span>

                    <span>Disclaimer: This is my first time using Vim (actually Neovim 😎), so by no means am I an expert.
This article was really helpful while configuring Neovim on my machine.
Vim is basically a text editor for Unix. It&#x27;s similar to other programs like Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text Editor or Atom.
So what led me to Vim


I love new challenges and improving my productivity. VS code was pretty customized and suitable for my current needs. Maybe YouTube videos from this guy (DistroTube) was the motivation to try it out. 
Efficiency: Vim is designed to reduce how often switch from your keyboard to a mouse. They are literally keybinding for any type of operation and you can create custom keybindings too. If you type really fast, this will improve your productivity as you will really need your mouse.
Learning Curve: Vim has quite a learning curve if you&#x27;re just starting. For the first few days, my focus was shifted majorly from the code I write to the tool I use. This is going to pay off later by building up muscle memory you will be able to exit Vim in your sleep.
A quick meme about exiting vim:

Conclusion


I will continue sharing my learning experience and journey with Vim for the next few months
Whatever editor, language or framework you use, they should be able to solve your problems effectively and efficiently. 
Neovim and it&#x27;s simpler and maintained. 
Do you think it is worth the time to learn Vim?</span>

I think its fair to say i have a bit of an addiction to Linux distro&#x27;s.... over the last few months i have tried and tested a number of them and also blogged about a few... here is a brief list of distro&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tested in the last 3 months.
Ubuntu (Normal)
Kubuntu (KDE)
Lubuntu
Elementary OS (my favourite so far)
Pop!_OS
Fedora 35
Zorin Core
And that&#x27;s probably missing a few... yes I&#x27;m a distro wh*re...
The absolute beauty of Linux Distro&#x27;s is you can get up and running with what you need really fast. In my case i can get my Laravel development environment setup in less than 30 minutes on Ubuntu based distro and that would include sorting out my ssh access and GitHub keys...
With the exception of Fedora, all of the distributions above all have Ubuntu in common so the commands…</span>

This was also all written at time of the announcement of Public Preview, so things are liable to change ahead of General Availability.
Amazon Linux has traditionally been built around CentOS. With the transition from its standard release cycle to CentOS Stream, Amazon has decided transition to using Fedora as the base for Amazon Linux 2022, with the kernel from the Linux LTS versions.

Personal opinion: CentOS Stream is a bad choice for production use, and Amazon made a good decision to not try and shoe-horn it into Amazon Linux. Fedora also makes sense since it was alr…</span>

                    <span>What is Ubuntu and Linux?


To start with, I had the same question myself because I had no idea so I am adding this link.
What is difference between Ubuntu and Linux?
Linux


Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldn&#x27;t function.
Kernel – This is the one piece of the whole that is actually called Linux. The kernel is the core of the system and manages the CPU, memory, and peripheral device…</span>

                    <span>One of the core principles to DevOps and SRE is a skill that a lot of new engineers are losing, which is the understanding of systems (servers, for example) and operating systems. Not too long ago, as an engineer, you had to understand how to install Linux. You needed to know how to dedicate storage to the OS, mount volumes, install the operating system itself, and configure the operating system.
Now, things are slightly different ever since we started living in a cloudy world. Getting a system up and running is as easy as logging into a cloud portal and clicking a few buttons. 
The problem with not knowing about operating systems is; regardless how much abstraction there is, systems are still needed. For example, a Docker container is running a flavor of Linux or a version of Windows. You…</span>

                    <span>For as long as I can remember the recommended way to generate unique universal Identifiers in node.js was to the uuid module. These IDs are useful in all sorts of scenarios including for database keys, filenames, URLs, etc. Recently both node.js and the browser began offering nearly identical APIs that will generate 36-character version 4 uuids without any dependencies.
Available in Chrome since July 2021 and coming soon other browsers is crypto.randomUUID(). There&#x27;s a global crypto object that&#x27;s available on the global self property. You can use that to generate a UUID like this:
self.crypto.randomUUID();

The UUID it generates is a v4 UUID per the spec and ends up with a string that looks something like this:
&quot;0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d&quot;


You want to do the same thing in node? Instead of reaching for the uuid package. As long as you&#x27;re on version 14.17 or newer, you can do this:
const { randomUUID } &#x3D; require(&quot;crypto&quot;);
randomUUID(); // &quot;0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d&quot;

It&#x27;s cool see node and the browser adopting powerful APIs for crypto and improved randomness. I&#x27;ll definitely be reaching for these in the near future!
You can read more in the WebCrypto section in the MDN or the crypto section in the node.js docs.</span>

                    <span>A backend for frontend (BFF) is one of these newer architectural patterns that especially became relevant after the rise of microservices and domain-driven design, as it is a way to simplify the communication between the frontend and backend and make the frontend development simpler.
In this post, I will cover BFFs with Angular and if and how you should do it in your project.

                    <span>I have written previously about a clean code angle I rarely read about: writing code with the available coding tools in mind.
This is a change in viewpoint.
Instead of scraping together the easiest to write code possible you think about how much the coding tools (particularly your IDE or typescript transpiler) are going to be able to make use of it.
If this sounds alien to you I have found recently a seemingly innocent thing that can actually lead you to problems.
Let&#x27;s say you want to start up a koa server using routing-controllers library. You have controllers, middlewares, interceptors...
Also you have two options: add these functions as an array or add the directories and createKoaServer function will look it up for you.

This article will get you started with load testing your Node.js APIs using Artillery. You&#x27;ll be able to detect and fix critical performance issues before you deploy code to production.
Before we dive in and set up Artillery for a Node.js app, though, let&#x27;s first answer the question: what is load testing and why is it important?
Load testing is essential to quantify system performance and identify breaking points at which an application starts to fail. A load test generally involves simulating user queries to a remote server.

Now, this would create a folder named ‘todo’ in our current repository. Next, we should move inside the todo folder by
    cd todo

Now, we will install libraries we need using npm which would help us with using the Bootstrap library to apply the styling.
    npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap

                    <span>According to the StackOverflow developers survey, Node.js is the most popular development framework among developers from the last few years. It is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a V8 engine.
The syntax is simple and easy to understand, also it is best for asynchronous and event-driven programming. Therefore getting started with Node.js is effortless but once you step into advanced programming, you need to deal with the code complexity and errors that can become troublesome.
However, following the best Node.js practices reduces the possibilities of errors and loopholes in your code and keeps your app safe from the most common Node.js traps.

                    <span>What are AWS Lambda Cold Starts?


Whenever we call a lambda function it doesn&#x27;t just start instantly if you haven&#x27;t called it recently, it takes time before it starts executing the code, this happens because AWS shuts down the container responsible for executing the code inside our lambda function if it&#x27;s not called for some time then, so the time taken to start up a new container before executing the code inside the lambda function is called a cold start or we can say that it is the delay before actual code execution starts inside our lambda function.
If we are using AWS Serverless framework then there is a plugin called serverless-plugin-warmup it is a third party NPM (Node package module) which polls the lambda function of our choice, this way that lambda function stays warm and AWS do…</span>

                    <span>For as long as I can remember the recommended way to generate unique universal Identifiers in node.js was to the uuid module. These IDs are useful in all sorts of scenarios including for database keys, filenames, URLs, etc. Recently both node.js and the browser began offering nearly identical APIs that will generate 36-character version 4 uuids without any dependencies.
Available in Chrome since July 2021 and coming soon other browsers is crypto.randomUUID(). There&#x27;s a global crypto object that&#x27;s available on the global self property. You can use that to generate a UUID like this:
self.crypto.randomUUID();

The UUID it generates is a v4 UUID per the spec and ends up with a string that looks something like this:
&quot;0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d&quot;


You want to do the same thing in node? Instead of reaching for the uuid package. As long as you&#x27;re on version 14.17 or newer, you can do this:
const { randomUUID } &#x3D; require(&quot;crypto&quot;);
randomUUID(); // &quot;0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d&quot;

It&#x27;s cool see node and the browser adopting powerful APIs for crypto and improved randomness. I&#x27;ll definitely be reaching for these in the near future!

Authentication is the process of determining who someone or something is. In the real world, when you give someone your ID or passport, that&#x27;s a form of authentication. Online, when you enter an email/password, that&#x27;s a form of authentication.
While authentication processes can also be for machine-to-machine communication, in this post we&#x27;ll focus on users identifying themselves to a web server - a.k.a. user authentication.
To simplify the problem, we need two processes:

Indeed, not really amateurs in terms of know-how to develop software in a secure way.
Well despite this, this researcher has managed to go through all the defenses of his companies simply by going through the development libraries that all developers use so as not to have to constantly reinvent the wheel.
By injecting malware into these libraries, he only had to wait for an update within these companies to be deployed without doing anything.
We talk about it in this video and I explain how to avoid falling into the trap yourself.

                    <span>Greetings fellow developers on dev.to
Today I am mentioning a topic why is neccessary when owning your own small business, or protecting your by using installing surveillance cameras. 
The cameras which you install to protect your possession do mostly offer no more than a video source, which is persisted on any type of hard drive (in marketing they would say &quot;secure data server&quot;) inside of your shop or home and will only be inspected if something happened. 
Some more modern surveillance technologies do also offer motion detection.
Thus the motion detection may somehow be used to update the cameras orientation, as often seen in Action Movies. The camera may follow the motion by a certain degree thus the original field of view is still in sight but the motion can be captured too.

Get deeper into some topics I like: I think writing things down leads to better learning.
Help other people.
Improve my communication skills.

                    <span>What if we connect a couple of rotating sticks together and trace the shape they make? We can get something like this.

The most interesting part about this is if we get enough sticks we can draw anything we want!
You can try it yourself here. Just draw a closed (that&#x27;s pretty important) shape and press &#x27;Start&#x27;.
This is based on a thing caller Fourier Transform. Basically, every complex function on a set interval can be represented as an infinite sum of exponents:
f(t)&#x3D;∑n&#x3D;−inf⁡inf⁡cnen2πit,0≤t≤1
f(t) &#x3D; \sum_{n&#x3D;-\inf}^{\inf}c_n e^{n 2 \pi i t}, 
0 \le t \le 1
f(t)&#x3D;n&#x3D;−inf∑inf​cn​en2πit,0≤t≤1



Where
cn&#x3D;∫01f(t)e−n2πit
c_n &#x3D; \int_0^1 f(t) e^{-n 2 \pi i t}
cn​&#x3D;∫01​f(t)e−n2πit



But if we look closer we may notice that every element of that sum is actually a rotating vector Cn. So if we manage to represent a shape as a complex function, we could find these vectors (maybe not all, since there is infinite number of them, but we don&#x27;t need all) and that would mean drawing the shape just by rotating those vectors!
I made a video where I tried to explain this in more detail and code it in TypeScript.

Let&#x27;s see how this can bring benefits to our release and team workflow processes. This is an example from my personal experience.
Usual Workflow
Currently, QA and product reviews are tightly coupled to releases and it&#x27;s often hard to roll back changes once they&#x27;re in the release itself.

                    <span>Heyaa, welcome back, I hope you&#x27;re doing well, in the previous article we&#x27;ve discussed basic data types and some discussions around some types, you can check it up if you don&#x27;t know about that.
But now we&#x27;re going to talk about the:
One of the most important and underrated concepts related to types, I&#x27;d go saying if you don&#x27;t understand type coercion and how it works, you won&#x27;t be able to reason about your code base.
How would you make an algorithm if you&#x27;re ignoring if types coerce to another type?
That&#x27;s where bugs come from btw, the divergence of your mental model or intention and how JavaScript behaves and thinks, and yeh, JS never mistakes.. umm, maybe a little bit.. aight, JS messes up with types, so help her!
I don&#x27;t know about you, but I find these anti-coercion people who claim th…</span>

                    <span>Heya, nice to see you again in another article, today&#x27;s topic is kind off functional programming, I thought it my be nice to get back the basics and talk about types which is one of my favourite topics.
So why not have a series that&#x27;s dedicated to the typesystem that JS has?
In this article I&#x27;ll to go all beasty about types and why you should really care about types, so hold tight and let&#x27;s go.
&quot;Stop using double equal, tripe equal for the way&quot;, you often see this recommendation in some courses, blogs, and even books that favors the tripe equal &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; over the double equal &#x3D;&#x3D; as they claim it&#x27;s better in terms of handling corner cases. HELL NO
I won&#x27;t argue that back in time I believed such claim and even spread it in some of my courses, articles. But meh, we all do silly things.
So, let&#x27;s ge…</span>

With the Angular CLI no longer including a complete out-of-the-box development solution, it is more important than ever to understand the tools at our disposal to improve the developer experience when building Angular applications.
Modern Angular Tooling is the term used to describe modern tools that will enable you and your team to build a comprehensive development environment. This development environment takes advantage of the latest improvements in the JavaScript ecosystem to improve productivity, consistency, reliability, scalability and developer experience when building Angular applications and libraries. 
We consider Modern Tools to be additional tools that can and should be used when building Angular applications and Angular libraries. These tools…</span>

                    <span>Top Reasons Why Everyone is Opting for ReactJS over Angular
1. Better Performance
React is mostly like a library than just a framework. Therefore, one does not has to work upfront with DOM or Data Object Model. Instead of that, it goes for a Virtual DOM layer. It updates only those parts of the actual DOM which is needed to update. This escalates the development speed in React instead of Angular. 
Moreover, the Virtual DOM is one of the best features to have as it resolves the issues associated with cross-browser.
The developers also get access to a unified API of cross-browser that runs even on old browser versions. Such excellent performance of React has made everyone not hire AngularJS developers and opt for ReactJS developers as it is becoming more and more popular than Angular.

                    <span>Introduction


Angular comes with many built-in directives. Some of them (eg. NgIf, NgModel or FormControlDirective) are used daily by Angular developers. Those directives can be split into 2 categories:
Attribute directives
They can be used to modify the appearance of behavior of Angular components and DOM elements. For example:
RouterLink
NgModel
FormControlDirective
Structural directives
They can be used to manipulate the HTML structure in the DOM. Using them, we can change the structure of part of the DOM that they control. For example:
NgIf
NgForOf
NgSwitch
In this article, I will focus on the latter.
As I&#x27;ve mentioned above, there are a couple of built-in structural directives in Angular. However, we might come across a case that the ones provided with the framework don&#x27;t solve. This…</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s not uncommon to see Angular apps slow down over time. Angular is a performant platform, but if we don&#x27;t know how to create performant Angular apps, our apps will become slower as they evolve. As a result, any serious Angular developer must be aware of what makes an Angular app slow in order to prevent it from being slow in the first place.
Change detection can be the most performance-intensive part of Angular apps, so it&#x27;s important to understand how to render the templates efficiently so that we would just re-rendering a component if it has new changes to display.
When an asynchronous event occurs in the app, such as click, XMLHttpRequest, or setTimeout, the default change detection behavior for components is to re-render. This can be a matter of concern because it will result in a l…</span>

                    <span>Installing node in linux is quite challenging sometimes, especially if you are a beginner and don&#x27;t have any idea on how to do that.
In this article, I will show you three different ways of installing Nodejs in linux. You can feel comfortable following the same process in any ubuntu-baseds distro you use.
Installation of Nodejs is insanely easy with apt package manager in linux. To install nodejs with apt package manager, just open up your terminal. Copy this command sudo apt update  &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade and paste here, hit enter, and type your password. Then we use the command sudo apt install nodejs, press enter, wait few seconds and you find your nodejs is successfully installed. To check the version just type the command node —version and you get the version.

                    <span>I picked up Cyberpunk 2077 on GOG at 50% off for black friday. I had a bit of trouble getting it to work on Linux (POP!_OS), here are my steps in case it helps someone else. 
First, I spun up Lutris and the game downloaded and installed fine. But when I tried to launch it, it first crashed, then on second launch it played but felt like I was watching a stop motion video. 
After googling, I found proton-tkg which is a patched version of Steam&#x27;s proton. Downloaded:
wget https://github.com/Frogging-Family/wine-tkg-git/releases/download/6.17.r0.g5f19a815/proton_tkg_6.17.r0.g5f19a815.release.tar.gz

Unpacked it
tar xf proton_tkg_6.17.r0.g5f19a815.release.tar.gz

Then I linked it to the runners and restarted Lutris.
ln -s /home//Downloads/proton_tkg_6.17.r0.g5f19a815.release/files/ /home//.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/proton

Selected the proton item under the Runner Options:

I&#x27;ve been playing for an hour now, it&#x27;s smooth and hasn&#x27;t crashed. YMMV
Good Luck Have Fun!

                    <span>For application access, you should not use the managed AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for Amazon DynamoDB. These IAM policies are designed for use with the AWS Web Console and therefore have more permissions to more services than most applications need access to. Instead, please create your own IAM policies for DynamoDB.
In order to follow least privilege security conventions, it is best practice to create your own custom IAM policy for DynamoDB access by an application. If this is something you have never done before, don&#x27;t be intimidated. I got ya. To get you started, here are a few templates I created to use to enable full access to only Amazon DynamoDB table resources. 
Once you play with these templates, you should ultimately create a new policy that narrows access down to just the operations the app needs to do on the resources it needs to do it. If all you are doing is SELECT and INSERT with the PartiQL API for DynamoDB on one table, then the only actions you should allow are these two:
&quot;dynamodb:PartiQLInsert&quot;
&quot;dynamodb:PartiQLSelect&quot;
In summary, use security best practices when designing access to Amazon DynamoDB for your apps, create your own customer managed IAM policies and do not use the AWS managed IAM policies.</span>

                    <span>Transmitting Data Via the Client


Many applications leave themselves exposed because they transmit critical data such as product prices and discount rates via the client in an unsafe manner.
If possible, applications should avoid transmitting this kind of data via the client. In virtually any conceivable scenario, it is possible to hold such data on the server and reference it directly from server-side logic when needed. 
For example, an application that receives users’ orders for various products should allow users to submit a product code and quantity and look up the price of each requested product in a server-side database. There is no need for users to submit the prices of items back to the server. Even where an application offers different prices or discounts to different users, ther…</span>

I was in my 2nd-year @delhitechnicalcampus. College timing is 9 to 4 pm, and I have to rush to pick public transport at 7 pm. It took 2 hours to reach college in between route of Noida to Pari chowk. I used this new service Shuttl. 
Shuttl - They provide Transport service from Noida Sector 37 to Pari Chowk. I am inspired by this startup as they provide 30 rupee journey costs in 10 rupees and with AC minibus.

So, for the first ride, they provide a free Coupon Ride, which is one time applicable. BUT why so and why don&#x27;t we apply again so? For this, I made a Dual app and login with my secondary number, but that code is not valid for the second number. What the Hackman!

I need to figure out how&#x27;s this thing working and why can&#x27;t I apply code in my secondary number account…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Angular comes with many built-in directives. Some of them (eg. NgIf, NgModel or FormControlDirective) are used daily by Angular developers. Those directives can be split into 2 categories:
Attribute directives
They can be used to modify the appearance of behavior of Angular components and DOM elements. For example:
RouterLink
NgModel
FormControlDirective
Structural directives
They can be used to manipulate the HTML structure in the DOM. Using them, we can change the structure of part of the DOM that they control. For example:
NgIf
NgForOf
NgSwitch
In this article, I will focus on the latter.
As I&#x27;ve mentioned above, there are a couple of built-in structural directives in Angular. However, we might come across a case that the ones provided with the framework don&#x27;t solve. This…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 13 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
Form validation enables the quality, accuracy, and integrity of the user input data. It’s possible to validate a form in Angular in two ways, one with reactive (using functions in the component class) and the other with template-driven forms (using attributes in the HTML) and we will use the template-driven forms way.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the application with the Angular base structure using the @angular/cli with the route file and the SCSS style…</span>

  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.

scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label &#x60;job&#x3D;&#x60; to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: &#x27;prometheus&#x27;

    # metrics_path defaults to &#x27;/metrics&#x27;
    # scheme defaults to &#x27;http&#x27;.

    static_configs:
      - targets: [&#x27;localhost:9090&#x27;]

  - job_name: &#x27;node-exporter&#x27;

    # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
    scrape_interval: 5s
    metrics_path: /metrics

    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - :9100

This is a good starting place for a monitoring system for Linux boxes
Running the services in docker is also advised as it simplifies the rollout.
Docker node exporter:
sudo docker run --restart always -d --net&#x3D;&quot;host&quot; --pid&#x3D;&quot;host&quot;  -v &quot;/:/host:ro,rslave&quot;  prom/node-exporter:latest  --path.rootfs&#x3D;/host

Docker prometheus:
sudo docker service create --replicas 1 --name dockerprometheus     --mount type&#x3D;bind,source&#x3D;/home/ubuntu/prometheus/prometheus.yml,destination&#x3D;/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml     --publish published&#x3D;9090,target&#x3D;9090,protocol&#x3D;tcp     prom/prometheus

When you get around to making panels in Grafana, these queries are very useful:
100 - ((node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint&#x3D;&quot;/&quot;,fstype!&#x3D;&quot;rootfs&quot;} * 100) /            node_filesystem_size_bytes{mountpoint&#x3D;&quot;/&quot;,fstype!&#x3D;&quot;rootfs&quot;})

node_filesystem_avail_bytes


OR you could just setup a template for Node Exporter:

Enter 405 for the Grafana ID.

Pick up the name and choose a Data Source for the dashboard.

To make an alert, start a NEW dashboard and NEW panel. Template dashboards like above will not work. 
Enter the query for the item you want to track and press the Alert tab.
That should do it for a basic monitoring service.</span>

                    <span>Intro


When using the Command Line Interface, we often find a few long and / or confusing commands. And this post intends to ease the pain of getting along with that.
When things start to get complicated, there are some things that can be done. In this post, we are talking about three of them:
Aliases
Functions
Comments
An alias is exactly what it means: a nickname. It is very useful when running commands that take too much arguments. For example:
alias lah&#x3D;ls -ltrah

Now, when running the lah command, it will be exactly like running ls -ltrah.
A function is probably the best way to run a group of commands. When adding a if or a for statement, it gets even more interesting. Let&#x27;s suppose we want to connect to a server which is still being provisioned or rebooted:
function keeptrying() {
