                    <span>As part of promoting DRY (don&#x27;t repeat yourself), MDD (model-driven development), and code generator, I would like to show its full power on a real-life example.
We will implement a simple ToDo app with backend and client app. Let&#x27;s start.
First we will define the project with basic informations.
todo project[
    url www.todo.com 
    namespace com.todo
    version 1 . 0 . 0 . 0
    environments prod

Now we will define the #backendpart of the app.
backend server[
        owners(duskovesin)
        template springboot(tests fabut)        
    ]

We are starting with the definition of User and Todo #models, with a few fields and Todo Status #enums.
        UserRole enum(
            ADMIN
            MEMBER

Los siguientes proyectos no est√°n asociados con una versi√≥n Angular particular.

Por ejemplo, las funciones se publican en el siguiente menor despu√©s de que se completan, o el siguiente mayor si incluyen cambios importantes.

Para mejorar los tiempos de prueba y crear un mejor aislamiento entre las pruebas, queremos cambiar TestBed para limpiar y derribar autom√°ticamente el entorno de prueba despu√©s de cada ejecuci√≥n de prueba.

                    <span>On this post we discuss the necessary IaC (Infrastructure as Code) files to provision an EKS cluster capable of sharing a single GPU between multiple pods (code available here).
If you ever tried to use GPU-based instances with AWS ECS, or on EKS using the default Nvidia plugin, you would know that it&#x27;s not possible to make a task/pod shared the same GPU on an instance. If you want to add more replicas to your service (for redundancy or load balancing), you would need one GPU for each replica.
And this doesn&#x27;t seem to be going to change in the near future for ECS (see this feature request)
GPU-based instances are expensive, and despite the fact that some Machine Learning frameworks (e.g. Tensorflow) are pre-configured to use the entire GPU by default, that&#x27;s not always the case. ML service‚Ä¶</span>

Joe Doss is leading us on this adventure into Linux.

The adventure starts by working through the Gentoo Handbook and installing Gentoo(a distribution of Linux) on Lenovo ThinkPads.

During our meetings, I have been taking notes. These notes are useful for people in our club. 
One of the first things we did when we got our laptops was set up our BIOS. 
This post will give a brief description of what BIOS is, how to navigate to it, and some of the common settings you might change. 
BIOS or Basic Input/Output System is a small piece of code that lives in a ‚Äúread only‚Äù chip on your system board(motherboard).

                    <span>One API ecosystem challenge I&#x27;ve had over the years is quantifying what &quot;good&quot; looks like (I&#x27;ve published that journey on my website, with pieces including &quot;Rethinking NPS for Quality&quot; and &quot;How Reporting Can Backfire&quot; ). Despite most organizations&#x27; desire to be &quot;data-driven&quot;, much of the quality storytelling we do remains anecdotal and story driven.
On the one hand, quantifying abstract concepts like &quot;maturity&quot;, &quot;quality&quot;, or &quot;maintainability&quot; is problematic. On the other hand, quantifiable metrics like &quot;time-to-hello-world&quot; and &quot;uptime percentile&quot; don&#x27;t describe the health of an API ecosystem or whether improvement efforts are improving the speed and safety of overall API development.
I joined Postman in April, just as the company was preparing its latest survey. I saw it as an opportunity to build upon existing industry devops insights by testing whether they also apply to API program performance.
In the 180th Net #API Notes, I deep dive on the Postman 2021 State of the APIs Report; specifically, what are the four behaviors of high-performing API teams? And how do we measure them?

Enterprise preferred but Dev Edition works as well if you don&#x27;t have one, note the limits for number of scratch orgs and number of active orgs which varies by instance.
Log in as System Administrator to your Developer Edition, trial, or production org (for customers), or your business org (for ISVs).
From Setup, enter Dev Hub in the Quick Find box and select Dev Hub.
If you don&#x27;t see Dev Hub in the Setup menu, make sure that your org is one of the supported editions.
To enable Dev Hub, click Enable.

                    <span>Okta (Auth0) was placed into the Leader Quadrant for 2021, parent company Okta also named a Leader.



  
  
  
We are proud to announce that Auth0, a product unit within Okta, has been recognized as a Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management, Worldwide. Gartner defines the Access Management market as: &quot;The access management (AM) market is defined by customers‚Äô needs to establish, enforce, and manage run-time access controls for internal and external types of identities, as well as machine identities, interacting with cloud, modern standards-based web and legacy web applications&quot; Auth0 focuses on SaaS-delivered developer-centric and Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) use cases.
For more information, please download the full 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management report.

The Magic Quadrant recognized Okta (Auth0) as a Leader based on our Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision.  
Auth0 believes that CIAM should do more to balance the three forces of security, privacy and convenience ‚Äî not just keeping the bad actors out, but also driving customer loyalty and conversion and revenue to create a great experience for our customers, partners, and their end-users.
We believe vendors&#x27; experience in the space is a key consideration for Gartner in their Magic Quadrant Evaluations. As stated by one of our customers in their review of Auth0, included in the 2021 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer Access Management Report, Auth0 comes with great features out-of-the-box. We went live easily with Auth0 as our Identity Provider. The platform/vendor does not just support us in a technical angle, but also understanding our user journey and sharing their experience (with other clients) and what approaches to take to minimize risk and even enhance user experience during the migration. ‚Äî VP, Core Product Development, Retail industry

                    <span>AWS Amplify is allowing you to build cloud-connected apps very easily. It has a broad range of categories it supports natively which you can use to build (see my  post  here). But there are still some major components missing, such as SQS and RDS. In this post, I want to show you how to add AWS services that are not currently supported in Amplify. We start with the general steps you need to take for adding these resources. In the second part, I show you how to add an SQS queue that triggers a lambda. 
There are many ways of doing this but I think the easiest is to use CloudFormation. It is also possible to use frameworks like CDK or Terraform but CloudFormation is best integrated into Amplify. All deployments and updates will still happen from the Amplify CLI and no other tool is needed. A‚Ä¶</span>

Linux is one of the most popular operating systems in the world. It is Unix-like, and it is also open-source. Quite a big percentage of developers use Linux because it can be customized in so many ways.
What&#x27;s cool about Linux is its command line. Every &#x27;hackers&#x27; paradise. There are a ton of commands. If you aren&#x27;t familiar with any Linux commands, be sure to check out this post on the 8 Linux Commands Everyone Should Know.
There is probably a command for almost anything that you want to do. For example what if you wanted to get the size of a directory? Well luckily for you there is a command for that. In this post, we are going to talk about that command and see what it can offer.

                    <span>Hi thereüëã,
In this guide we will be learning how to integrate MongoDB in our project using Mongoose.
or the backend of your app)
MongoDB is an open-source document database and leading NoSQL database.
Mongoose is an Object Data Modelling(ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
Instead of connecting our node app directly to MongoDB, we will use Mongoose.


For this guide, we will be storing user info. in our database.
If you&#x27;re working on complete MERN stack then all of these steps are meant to be perform in the backend of your app.)
1. Start with installing Mongoose.
npm install mongoose

2. Create a file userModel.js.
In this file, we will create a userSchema. A schema is the structure of the database.
import mongoose from &quot;mongoose&quot;;

                    <span>This post illustrates deployment process of Server Side Rendered Angular application, as can be guessed from the title.
Though, AWS has a dedicated service for deploying SSR applications, called  AWS Amplify, but, as of writing this post, Angular Universal is not supported by Amplify. There are multiple other options available to achieve the required result. One of the more popular ones were the usage of a third party API, called Serverless. But, It was particularly challenging for me to find a clean and vanilla solution as I was juggling between different options.
Below, I will demonstrate the usage of AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy Angular SSR.     
Open AWS Management Console and go to Elastic Beanstalk homepage. Click on Create Application.

Next, Give your application a name, and select Platform and Platform branch as illustrated below.

On the same page, proceed with uploading the zipped dist folder of your Angular app which gets generated upon building your app in the local system. Now, click on Configure more options button. 

On the next screen, click on the Edit button on the software tile.
  
Provide the Node Command considering dist as root. The path used in Node Command generally is of the folder where file to be run is placed.

Save the Configuration and click on Create App subsequently. Environment setup will take a few minutes, after which it will provide the Health status, logs and Deployment URL, as, can be seen below.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s see how you can connect to a MySQL database using Node.js, the popular JavaScript runtime environment.


Create a MySQL database



mysql -u USER -p



CREATE DATABASE employees;

USE employees;
Create a table in the database:


CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (    
id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,    
name varchar(50),    
PRIMARY KEY (id)  
);
INSERT INTO employees (nombre) VALUES (&quot;Silvia&quot;);  
INSERT INTO employees (nombre) VALUES (&quot;Luigi&quot;);  
INSERT INTO employees (nombre) VALUES (&quot;Alejandro&quot;);




¬†


Install node-mysql
You will need to have the node-mysql package installed, so if you don&#x27;t have it installed, you will need to install it. To do this you must use the npm package manager:


npm install mysql



Establish the MySQL connection



var mysql &#x3D; require(&#x27;mysql&#x27;);  
var conexion&#x3D; mysql.createConnection({      
   host : &#x27;localhost&#x27;,      
   database : &#x27;employees&#x27;,      
   user : &#x27;USER&#x27;,      
   password : &#x27;PASS&#x27;,  
});    
conexion.connect(function(err) {     
   if (err) {          
       console.error(&#x27;Error de conexion: &#x27; + err.stack);          
       return;      
   }      
   console.log(&#x27;Connected to the identifier &#x27; + conexion.threadId); 
});



conexion.query(&#x27;SELECT * FROM empleados&#x27;, function (error, results, fields) {
      if (error)          
          throw error;        
      results.forEach(result &#x3D;&gt; {          
      console.log(result);      
      });  
});
Finally, terminate the connection:


connection.end();

                    <span>After years of struggling when building a notification infrastructure for different projects I was involved with. My partner and I finally decided to open-source most of the work and bring it back to the community instead of building it all over again closed-source.
I&#x27;ve not even imagined the amount of traction the repository got in the last couple of days. How did happen you ask?
When first releasing the library we only introduced a node.js library to unify all the notification channels into a single API. Send emails, SMS, and other mediums with the same code. Need to change SES to SendGrid? No problem. Just a single line of code.
This got some traction, but nothing impressive so far.
Next comes, building and restructuring our major infrastructure blocks in preparation for a big open-sour‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>JSON limitations


Wouldn&#x27;t you find it strange if adults who are fluent in the same language spoke to each other using the vocabulary of a 3-year-old? Well, something analogous is happening when browsers and JavaScript servers exchange data using JSON, the de facto serialization format on the internet.
For example, if we wanted to send a Date object from a JavaScript server to a browser, we would have to:
Convert the Date object to a number.
Convert the number to a JSON string.
Send the JSON string to the browser.
Revert the JSON string to a number.
Realize the number represents a date.
Revert the number to a Date object.
This roundabout route seems ludicrous, because the browser and server both support the Date object, but is necessary, because JSON does not support the Date object.

                    <span>üí° What is the best way to apply Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to your ASP.NET Web API? Let&#x27;s find out together.



  
  
  
Role-Based Access Control, also known as RBAC, is one of the most common strategies to restrict access to protected resources within an organization. It simplifies permission assignment by categorizing users in roles. However, many people making their first foray into RBAC have questions:
How can you reflect this user categorization on your application to check users&#x27; privileges?
How can you deal with roles in your code?
Is role control appropriate for Web APIs?
In this article, you will learn the best way to implement RBAC in your ASP.NET Core Web API by using Auth0&#x27;s capabilities.

                    <span>Okta (Auth0) was placed into the Leader Quadrant for 2021, parent company Okta also named a Leader.



  
  
  
We are proud to announce that Auth0, a product unit within Okta, has been recognized as a Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management, Worldwide. Gartner defines the Access Management market as: &quot;The access management (AM) market is defined by customers‚Äô needs to establish, enforce, and manage run-time access controls for internal and external types of identities, as well as machine identities, interacting with cloud, modern standards-based web and legacy web applications&quot; Auth0 focuses on SaaS-delivered developer-centric and Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) use cases.
For more information, please download the full 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management report.

The Magic Quadrant recognized Okta (Auth0) as a Leader based on our Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision.  
Auth0 believes that CIAM should do more to balance the three forces of security, privacy and convenience ‚Äî not just keeping the bad actors out, but also driving customer loyalty and conversion and revenue to create a great experience for our customers, partners, and their end-users.
We believe vendors&#x27; experience in the space is a key consideration for Gartner in their Magic Quadrant Evaluations. As stated by one of our customers in their review of Auth0, included in the 2021 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer Access Management Report, Auth0 comes with great features out-of-the-box. We went live easily with Auth0 as our Identity Provider. The platform/vendor does not just support us in a technical angle, but also understanding our user journey and sharing their experience (with other clients) and what approaches to take to minimize risk and even enhance user experience during the migration. ‚Äî VP, Core Product Development, Retail industry

                    <span>Why Random Numbers Are Not Random?


The Random Numbers come from a particular seed number which is usually the system clock.Run the program below to understand the security risk.




The Python Documentation also has a warning about the same: &quot;The pseudo-random generators of this module should not be used for security purposes.&quot;
So all the password generators you have built using random module are not secure!? So How do we generate cryptographically secure numbers/passwords?
But there is another line after that warning:
For security or cryptographic uses, see the secrets module.&quot;
The secrets module is used for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets.

There was claims-extraction processing in earlier incarnations as part of the state field construction. In examining the flow, the diagram helps show there is no longer a claims-extraction step.

                    <span>I have many different places where I have to use the same logic, so I have generalized my logic system into a class...
...
const contextLayer &#x3D; new contextLayerCore(...useState([]));
...

This class provides me with a bunch of functions like addContext, removeAll, etc. However, the addContext function is a bit problematic...
...
addContext(context: listing) {
  this.setState([...this.state, context]);
}
...

Simple enough; all it does is append an object using the setState function which should re-render any components using the state. Here&#x27;s the problem, this causes an infinite loop...
...
this.setState([...this.state, context]);
//                     ^
// also updates when state updates, hence re-runs the setState function
...

This causes and infinite loop. I could using useEffect(..., []) to make it not be dependant, however, this is a function inside a class, thus it breaks React&#x27;s rules of hooks.
I have to retain the functionality of this class, so I cannot move the function up into the component(s) as a lot of components use this class and would simply create duplicate code.
And example of where it is used...
...

...

What should I do? Is there an alternative of useEffect? Should I be using a different system for this purpose?</span>

This is the last article in the series and in this final article we will be taking a look how to create a wrapper component for conditional rendering of components based on user permissions.
Why do we need it? Because it is more convenient to wrap a component in a wrapper than to call a hook in every case we need conditional rendering.
Let&#x27;s create an interface to represent the props of our future wrapper component in our models folder:
// ./permissions-validation/models/with-permissions-props.ts
import { ReactElement } from &#x27;react&#x27;;

export interface WithPermissionsProps {

                    <span>Most people have seen them, those immensely long import paths like the example below:
import module from &quot;../../../../../modules/module.ts&quot;;

To improve this, you can use import aliases and make it look like the example
import module from &quot;@/modules/module.ts&quot;;

The benefit of this is readability and that you can move files and folders to sub or parent directories without changing the import paths.
Tools like Vue CLI are supporting this out-of-the-box, but if you want to use the new blazing-fast build tool Vite, you&#x27;ll need to (at the time of writing)
For this to work, all tools need to know that import aliases are used by modifying each tool&#x27;s configuration file.
Vite has a configuration file called vite.config.ts and by adding the resolve object Vite will know that import aliases are being used:
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from &quot;vite&quot;;
import path from &quot;path&quot;;

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      &quot;@&quot;: path.resolve(__dirname, &quot;./src&quot;),
    },
  },
});

By adding a paths object to the compilerOptions inside the tsconfig.json like the example below TypeScript will also know that import aliases are being used:
// tsconfig.json
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    &quot;paths&quot;: {
      &quot;@/*&quot;: [&quot;./src&quot;]
    }
  }
}

At last Jest knows that aliasses are being used by adding the moduleNameMapper to the jest.config.ts configuration file like the code below:
// jest.config.ts
module.exports &#x3D; {
  moduleNameMapper: {
    &quot;^@/(.*)$&quot;: &quot;/src/$1&quot;,
  },
};</span>

                    <span>Before digging into the details, let me first do a very quick introduction to what GraphQL is.
GraphQL is a query language designed to build client applications by providing an intuitive and flexible syntax and system for describing their data requirements and interactions.
GraphQL does not mandate a particular programming language or storage system for application services that implement it. Instead, application services take their capabilities and map them to a uniform language, type system, and philosophy that GraphQL encodes.
This provides a unified interface friendly to product development and a powerful platform for tool-building.

Wouldn&#x27;t it be convenient if you could easily check the settings of tsconfig.json you are using? 
tsconf-checker, a package that can solve such problems.
{
    &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
        &quot;target&quot;: &quot;esnext&quot;,
        &quot;module&quot;: &quot;commonjs&quot;,

        &quot;forceConsistentCasingInFileNames&quot;: true,
        &quot;strict&quot;: true,
        &quot;strictFunctionTypes&quot;: true,
        &quot;skipLibCheck&quot;: true
    }
}

Specify the typescript file that targets tsconfig.json you want to check and execute the following command.
npx tsconf-checker index.ts

The result of the check is displayed.
Warning: &#x27;strictFunctionTypes&#x27; is implicitly true because &#x27;strict&#x27; option is true.
Warning: &#x27;skipLibCheck&#x27; option is officially recommended to be false.
Warning: &#x27;esModuleInterop&#x27; option is officially recommended to be false.
Warning: &#x27;forceConsistentCasingInFileNames&#x27; option is officially recommended to be false.

This function is perfect for you who want to have fun.</span>

With Angular 8, the Builders API was released, and it includes the ability to override commands such as ng build, ng test, and ng lint. Not to be confused with Angular Schematics, which can be used to add custom commands to ng generate or provide support for ng add.
We introduced the workspace file (angular.json) in the Angular CLI about a year ago, and we reworked several key principles of how its commands were implemented as a result. We ended up placing the following commands in boxes:

AngularJS is an open-source Javascript framework for Web App Development that is built and maintained by Google. It is developed to create client-side applications which are written in Javascript. Also, within no time, AngularJS emerged as a well-liked Javascript Framework. 
Amazon claims that every 100-millisecond increase in page loading time results in a 1% gain in revenue.

                    <span>Many people consider it to be Incident Response. In this case an incident refers to something not operating correctly in a cloud environment. The issue could be small - say a performance impact that doesn‚Äôt really affect successful operations. Alternatively, the impact could be massive - an outage that has ceased all operations with data loss, revenue loss, and damaged reputation (consider the recent Facebook outage or Roblox outage).
When an incident occurs, organizations will typically be alerted from a monitoring tool. These tools have parameters and ranges of acceptable use (think too many 500s, or too long to respond). The tool will likely then trigger an alert, which could come from another tool. The alerting tool could be simple (page everyone) or there could be sophisticated rules ‚Ä¶</span>

  What is Node JS?


Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js is a popular, lightweight web framework for beginners, and it is used by many big companies like Netflix and Uber.

First, we must install python3 and pip, together with some other dependencies:
$ sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
$ pip3 install distro jsonschema PyYAML

Then install kas; I had a problem with a dependency so I had to install another package by hand
$ pip3 install testresources
$ pip3 install kas

As an example, we can try to build a simple image for the qemu machine which is already contained in the poky
kas-project.yml, which will describe how our distribution must be built
$ mkdir kas-pine64
$ touch kas-project.yml

Add the following snippet to the project configuration file:

Let‚Äôs get into it.
I will assume you have an Adonis project already set up with lucid or your preferred method for storing information, we will then need to install the following packages:
Run the following commands to install and configure Ally:
npm i @adonisjs/ally

node ace configure @adonisjs/ally.

You will have to update your ‚ÄúclientId‚Äù, ‚ÄúclientSecret‚Äù and ‚ÄúcallbackUrl‚Äù in the configuration file stored in the config/ally.ts directory. 
Step 1: make user model and migration.
node ace make:model User ‚Äìm
The ‚Äú-m‚Äù flag creates a migration along with the model. 
The user migration file:

We&#x27;ll learn a bit of bash scripting on the way too! I&#x27;m really excited! Here we&#x27;ll be using PostgreSQL, but you can use any SQL DB. We&#x27;ll also be using Sequelize.

                    <span>There are a number of use cases where HLS manifest manipulation techniques are applicable. Multi CDN switching, server-side ad insertion, looping or truncating a VOD, to mention a few. The fundamental principle is that you need some HLS proxy between the video player and the original HLS you wish to modify somehow. As this is a very common component in all these use cases we have developed and open sourced an NPM library, hls-proxy, that takes care of that. In this post we will describe how to use it and examples of some use cases.
npm install --save @eyevinn/hls-proxy

Once installed in your NodeJS project you can start by creating a server.js that could look like this:
const { HLSProxy } &#x3D; require(&quot;@eyevinn/hls-proxy&quot;);

const handlers &#x3D; {...};

                    <span>This was my first time contributing to open source, being a student it seemed like a huge task. Nervous? Afraid? Cautious? YES! I spent hours reading up on how to contribute properly a week prior to the fest. 
The first 2 days were spent searching and starring projects. Now and then, some issues seemed very daunting while some seemed very simple. I also had to ignore the thousands of DSA repositories which were not purged in the first few days. After a lot of searching, I found my first issue and got assigned to it.
2 tasks which I felt were a good test of my skills
Portfolio-Builder Issue #1 - Here I had to develop a contact me section for the command line based portfolio builder which used NodeJS, Inquirer and ReactJS. 
validation on the backend, conditional rendering on the frontend and other small bugfixes.
Stay-Productive Landing Page Issue #3 - Here I had to add a new route to show the what&#x27;s new page with query parameters to and from. I also had to validate the format of the input. While the task was simple, just going through the whole codebase of the landing page and the Chrome plugin helped me learn a lot. I was also introduced to ESlint and testing friendly code.

Bauddhik Geeks, Ilya flowwishthebest and alemayhu for being so supportive.
Apprehension is everyone&#x27;s bane, only by trying (failing or succeeding) one can get rid of it.
Dividing the task into smaller subtasks and thinking on one at a time helps a lot.

8.9.0 you could start to use ES Modules by adding the ‚Äîexperimental-modules flag, but you should never use anything experimental in production.
But since Node version 13 you don‚Äôt really need to use that flag anymore and as long you use any version from 16 (but it&#x27;s also supported from version 14.14.0 and 12.20.0), it‚Äôs now fully supported to use, you just need to do a few small things.

You might want to take another look at your security.
APIs are everywhere and API Security is of the utmost importance for every organization. According to a recent Gartner CIO and Technical Executive survey, Cyber and Information security are at the top of the list for planned investments in 2022.
As someone who has spent my entire career in the world of APIs and Internet applications, I have seen first-hand the vulnerabilities that can exist with APIs.  




So let&#x27;s start with the basics.
The simple answer is that it is about applying and managing security for your APIs but we all know, there is nothing simple about API Security.

However, traditional firewalls (such as iptables and more), are not flexible enough. For example, there are cases where you want to restrict communication only from CI or the container environment where the application is running.
In this article, I will introduce bouheki, a tool that blocks data exfiltration by supply chain attacks and SSRF.

As I am looking for a way to learn Solidity faster and more fun, I happened to find Ethernaut made by @the_ethernaut and maintained by Openzeppelin team. 
The concept is like the hacking game where we need to inspect and exploit the contract to achieve the given objective. So we would get to have hands-on learning experiences as well. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Today&#x27;s challenge is #3 CoinFlip (Difficulty: 3/10). It is the contract that lets us guess the coin flip result. We have to magically guess it right 10 times consecutively. 
Ok... it is SO EASY, the chance is as much as 0.1% for success. üòÇ

                    <span>When we first started drafting the idea for Ovee.js, we‚Äôve decided that we don‚Äôt want to reinvent the wheel and wanted to avoid reimplementing complex parts like reactivity or templating for the millionth time. It‚Äôs a popular principle among back-end frameworks - Laravel heavily reuses parts of Symfony, Symfony by default comes bundled with Doctrine, Nest depends on Express (which even can be replaced with other implementation on demand). Yet, in the front-end field, each of the big frameworks is built fully independently (correct me, if I‚Äôve missed something). 
For the initial build of Ovee.js, we‚Äôve chosen on-change for handling simple reactivity, and lit-html for templating. We‚Äôve also built an optional module on top of Barba for asynchronous page transitions. This decision helped us to‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>In this simple tutorial, I will be explaining how to configure your windows subsystem for Linux efficiently and optimize your WSL performance when you&#x27;re running applications through them.
 Everyone has widespread access to windows but they may or maynot be savvy enough to run their favorite flavour of linux due to various constraints
WSL2 really makes life easy for those devs who can&#x27;t access linux through a cloud provider or locally run it on their devices.
WSL has support for various distros like Debian, Arch and Ubuntu.
Now coming to the interesting part, windows has all access to the CPU and memory resources in your device and it is built in a way which will optimize the resource utilization but how do you limit your linux subsystem, let  us say you&#x27;d like to manipulate the configuration to suit your needs the best, then you should follow these steps.
Shut your current running instance of WSL using this command
wsl --shutdown

Run this command through powershell as administrator
Create a configuration file for WSL on your user profile directory
notepad &quot;$env:USERPROFILE\.wslconfig&quot;

 This is the most important step in this project, so please follow carefully 
The following parameters define their corresponding resources:
CPU  &#x3D; &gt; cores dedicated to WSL
Memory  &#x3D; &gt; RAM allocated to WSL
AutoMount  &#x3D; &gt; Mount your default NTFS drive to your subsystem
Boot &#x3D;&gt; defines your booting options for services
Kernel  &#x3D; &gt; Custom kernel for linux
LocalhostForwarding  &#x3D; &gt; for port-forwarding your applications running on localhost
My configuration for CPU and memory:
[wsl2]
memory&#x3D;9GB  
processors&#x3D;4

This is how you can configure your resources for WSL üòÄ. Feel free to leave some comments down below‚¨áÔ∏è.

We strongly advise you to have at least fundamental knowledge of C programming language and Linux system programming before you continue.
Note that we skipped many error check and memory management for brevity which are must be included in working version of the code. Refer here for implemention.
When we open a shell(users perspective) it prompts us to enter a line of command and when we enter the command it executes our command and it prompts us to enter another command.
But there is more to this story. The following are simplified version of steps the shell takes.
The shell prints the prompt and waits for input. Let us assume we entered ls -l *.c. This is ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Why I switched?


So around 3 months ago I switched to Linux from Windows 10. I have a very low end PC so Windows 10 was lagging a lot so I thought to switch to Linux. 
I definitely ran a lot better than windows. But after some time, It&#x27;s UI also seemed a bit boring to me. So the I installed the KDE PLasma desktop environment on top of it. And I just loved it.
KDE has a lot of features and is very customizable
Very user friendly


Customisation
Noctis Round Theme




Keyboard Shortcuts


Addons 







System Wide Search
KDE has KRunner, which is a system wide search &amp; its much faster than  Window&#x27;s search. 

There are many other features in KDE that I like. 
Conclusion:


I just love KDE Plasma &amp; its a great alternative for Windows. 
I am not switching back to Windows anytime soon. 
So if you want to switch from Windows, try KDE plasma.</span>

Antes de la versi√≥n 12 de Angular era muy com√∫n hacer esto de alguna de las siguientes formas:
Agregar encabezados http en la solicitud http y luego evaluar ese encabezado en el interceptor.
Crear un nuevo httpClient para esa solicitud.
