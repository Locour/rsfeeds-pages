                    <span>Organizations continuously seek new approaches to build growth opportunities and reduce marketing time. One can increase their organization’s efficiency and agility by application or software modernization. Application modernization is a gateway to continuously improve your organization by refactoring a monolithic application into a set of independently developed, managed and deployed microservices.
Although you can use monolithic applications for a few use cases, modern features usually don’t work in an application based on monolithic architecture. Monolithic applications can become large and unmanageable that require coordination and effort from multiple teams, even if a small change is needed.
That’s why by choosing microservices you can decentralize your data stores and promote polyglo…</span>

                    <span>This article speaks about an interesting side-effect of mixing angular universal with progressive web application (pwa) - and that&#x27;s a massive performance boost!
--
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine

Once this is done, let&#x27;s quickly check if SSR is working as per our expectation.
npm run build:ssr &amp;&amp; npm run serve:ssr

Node server fires up on port 4000 and I check for my webpage&#x27;s source.
view-source:http://localhost:4000/


ng add @angular/pwa

No extra configurations so far, and that&#x27;s how it will be. Let&#x27;s build our universal application once again and serve it on localhost:4000.
But wait!!! Now when I view my webpage source on the browser, I get this:

So does this mean that my SSR is broken?
Nope! My SSR is perfectly fine :-) Let&#x27;s run a quick check to prove this. Open up POSTMAN and run a GET request against http://localhost:4000. And voila! I see my server-side-rendered page once again!

--
index.html is now cached by service-worker at the browser. The browser does not need to wait for the server to render the content any more, and it simply serves the cached version, and Angular takes over thereafter, like a normal SPA. Open up ngsw-config.json and verify that index.html is one of the cached resources.

Note (and a small exercise): If you remove index.html from ngsw-config.json and re-build your universal, you would see that the server-rendered content is back on your browser source, since the HTML is now no longer being cached!

                    <span>The join method is used to join the elements of an array together to create a string. It takes an argument for the delimiter that is used to separate the array elements in the string.


Here&#x27;s an example:




let arr &#x3D; [&quot;Playstation&quot;, &quot;Rules&quot;];
let str &#x3D; arr.join(&quot; &quot;);

str would have a value of the string Playstation Rules.


Let&#x27;s use the join method (among others) inside the sentensify function to make a sentence from the words in the string str. The function should return a string. For example, I-like-Star-Wars would be converted to I like Star Wars.




function sentensify(str) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}
sentensify(&quot;May-the-force-be-with-you&quot;);

Answer:




function sentensify(str) {
return str.split(/\W/).join(&quot; &quot;)

}
console.log(sentensify(&quot;May-the-force-be-with-you&quot;)); will return May the force be with you

                    <span>The split method splits a string into an array of strings. It takes an argument for the delimiter, which can be a character to use to break up the string or a regular expression. For example, if the delimiter is a space, you get an array of words, and if the delimiter is an empty string, you get an array of each character in the string.


Here are two examples that split one string by spaces, then another by digits using a regular expression:




let str &#x3D; &quot;Hello World&quot;;
let byWords &#x3D; str.split(&quot; &quot;);

let otherString &#x3D; &quot;How9are7you2today&quot;;
let byDigits &#x3D; otherString.split(/\d/);

// byWords would have the value [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;]
// byDigits would have the value [&quot;How&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;today&quot;]

Now let&#x27;s use the split method inside the splitify function to split str into an array of words. The function should return the array. Note that the words are not always separated by spaces, and the array should not contain punctuation.




function splitify(str) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}
splitify(&quot;Hello World,I-am code&quot;);

If you remember from my other posts simply split the string to create a new array of words. A simple regular expression can be used to achieve this result.
/\W/ Matches any non-word character. This includes spaces and punctuation, but not underscores. It’s equivalent to /[^A-Za-z0-9_]/


Answer:




function splitify(str) {
let splitWords &#x3D; str.split(/\W/)
return splitWords

}
console.log(splitify(&quot;Hello World,I-am code&quot;));

                    <span>A side effect of the sort method is that it changes the order of the elements in the original array. In other words, it mutates the array in place. One way to avoid this is to first concatenate an empty array to the one being sorted (remember that slice and concat return a new array), then run the sort method.
Use the sort method in the nonMutatingSort function to sort the elements of an array in ascending order. The function should return a new array, and not mutate the globalArray variable.








var globalArray &#x3D; [5, 6, 3, 2, 9];
function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}
nonMutatingSort(globalArray);

Answer:




var globalArray &#x3D; [5, 6, 3, 2, 9];
function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
let copy &#x3D; [...arr];
  copy.sort((a, b) &#x3D;&gt; {
     return a - b;
})
     return copy;
}
console.log(nonMutatingSort(globalArray)); will return [2, 3, 5, 6, 9]

OR




var globalArray &#x3D; [5, 6, 3, 2, 9];
function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
  return [].concat(arr).sort(function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  });
}
nonMutatingSort(globalArray);

Code Explanation:
First we concatenate the array taken in as a parameter to a new empty array.
Then Use the sort() method create a function to sort the new array in ascending order.

                    <span>Jenkins  is an open-source automation server written in Java. It supports the entire software delivery lifecycle, including build, document, test, package, stage, deployment, static code analysis, and deployments via plugins. Several tools (e.g. unit tests, report generation, SCM, etc.) can be integrated with Jenkins via plugins. Jenkins has been the most widely adopted tool for CI/CD, thanks to its energetic, active community. This Jenkins community offers more than  1800+ plugins 
The Jenkins project was started in 2004 (originally called Hudson) by  Kohsuke Kawaguchi. Initially created for Continous Integration (CI), today Jenkins is capable to orchestrate the entire software delivery pipeline – called Continuous Delivery (CD) and even further to provide Continuous Deployment.
Following is a diagrammatic representation of the Jenkins pipeline.

In many scenarios, a single Jenkins server isn&#x27;t sufficient to cater to the needs of multiple code-commits triggering zillions of pipelines. In such scenarios, distributed Jenkins architecture (Master Controller - Agents) can be leveraged.</span>

                    <span>This is my first post on Terraform series. Hence I will limit my discussion to the overview on Terraform and the creation of EC2 instance using Terraform in the simplest means.
Before approaching WHAT is Terraform, we need to address the WHY. First, let us understand Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and its role in the current digital transformation context.
Everybody has been gung-ho around Agile and DevOps processes. These practices around software development have yielded enormous benefits to organizations. Hence triggered the need to automate the mundane and manual process of Infrastructure deployments at scale. The sole purpose of Infrastructure as a Code (IaC) is to write &amp; execute code - to automate provisioning &amp; management of Infrastructure. This demands a change in mental mindset - t…</span>

Following is a list of Essential Docker commands that have helped me on a daily basis, hope this helps yo too. Happy Hacking!
docker run 
example
docker run hello-world
docker run  
example
docker run busybox ls
Docker ps command specifically shows running containers
docker ps
Show all container ever run on machine
docker ps --all
Docker ps is also used to get the ID of coantainer
docker run &#x3D; docker create + docker start
when we create container we just prep it with say file sysytem etc
When we run the container then we provide the default command that runs the program
docker create hello-world

As part of my personal development, I&#x27;ve created a personal health platform that uses various different microservices (Built using Azure Functions) that extract data from my Fitbit account and store them in an Azure Cosmos DB database. I have other microservices that pass messages between different services via Azure Service Bus.
For this project, I use Azure DevOps to build my artifacts, run my unit tests and deploy my microservices to Azure. The great thing about DevOps is that we can do all of this with in the YAML pipeline.
Yes I said YAML. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know what the fuss is all about 😂

                    <span>Running a bash script is easy, but it does take a few steps and it’s important to do them in the right order. In this post, we’ll go through the steps to ensure that your script will run correctly 😉
The first step is to make a bash script. Any bash script uses the Linux commands.  A script can simply be a file with a list of commands and the .sh extension. If you are new to Linux, you can use this site to practice. 
The second step is to make sure that your script file is executable. In Linux and macOS, you can check if a file is executable by running the ls -l command and then looking for an x in the permissions column. 
The example below shows the difference:
$ ls -l *.sh
-rwxrwxr-x 1 frank frank   43 mei 29 16:30 hello.sh
-rw-rw-r-- 1 frank frank 8192 jul  1 19:41 not-executable.sh

If it isn’t executable, run the following command in Terminal.
chmod +x script.sh

To start a script you write:
./script.sh

I can write a shell script when I need to, but then continue working in Python or Perl or C++ or whatever real programming language I&#x27;m most comfortable with at the time (these days mostly C++).
For example, one of my recent side projects involved crunching data from a database, working with various embedded systems and more. Shell is not the right tool for that kind of application.
Bash is more suited for when you write a lot of commands in the shell anyway and want to automate that.</span>

                    <span>I have discovered and used vim as my primary text editor for the past few years.
Vim, an acronym meaning Vi IMproved, is a ubiquitous text editor available on nearly every system imaginable. 
Even in the most arcane corners of life, you will find a version of vim. From the data center to the local science lab to the classroom to the server farm, there is probably a version of vim running.
Vim is a text editor that operates in the console. It is very popular among programmers, and is particularly well-suited to editing source code.

Vim is often used by terminal users. But it can also be used inside modern IDEs (vim mode) and there are graphical versions as well (gVim)
In this post, I&#x27;m going to lay out a Hacker&#x27;s Guide to Vim. This will be a collection of the best &quot;Vim resources&quot; that I have come across. 
Vim is a very complex tool with hundreds of commands and thousands of plugins that can be used to extend Vim and add functionality. So where do you start?
You can learn vim by exercise. This site offers interactive exercises. Vim is one of the programs you learn by doing.
Of course, the official vim website is a good resource as well. It has some documentation and lets you download vim. If you use Linux vim or vi is probably already installed, the same for Mac OS X users.
How to setup vim for Python. I find it quite useful, as I write quite a lot of Python code. Of course you can write Python code in any editor you want, I find for small scripts it&#x27;s very practical to fire up vim.
An introduction to vim. This article shows you the basics of vim. How to open a terminal, vim and how to quit (ESC ZQ).
Settings up vim for javascript. If you write a lot of JS code, you can use vim. You can also use vim-mode inside visual studio code or phpstorm.
A cheatsheet for vim. Shows an overview for the vim commands. While a cheat sheet is useful, i think it&#x27;s better to practice a lot with the commands.
A list of vim plugins. Personally I use NerdTree quite a bit.
Do you know any others? Which plugins do you use?</span>

How to create an LVM volume, how to configure and mount it in your operating system, how to add and remove disks, and how to recover the information you have accidentally deleted? In today’s article, you will find all of that – and even more.

LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is a standard disk management feature available in every version of Linux. The volume manager provides a new level of interaction between your operating system and disks or volumes which this system is using. In a conventional disk management pattern, Linux looks for available drives first, and then checks what volumes are available on these devices.
With the help of LVM, disks or volumes can be united into a single space. If the disk space is treated like tha…</span>

Make it build
Does it work?
The Good
The Bad


What can we solve with scripting?
Today we&#x27;re going to try something that will definitely work, it&#x27;s just a question of how bad a developer-experience we&#x27;ll end up with: We&#x27;ll compile our Typescript libraries into Javascript.
This will work because it cuts Typescript entirely out of the dependency equation, but it&#x27;ll also drive a huge wedge into our workflow because now changes to source-code has to be compiled before it can be seen by consumers. And I suspect we&#x27;ll find other downsides too.
Hopefully we can fix or alleviate those problems with some tooling or scripting, but this article isn&#x27;t meant to uncover  the golden solution that&#x27;ll end this article-series… It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m so very tired of hitting errors that I wa…</span>

The Visual Studio Code editor has all the tools to debug Node.js applications effectively. Its built-in debugger can debug any application that targets the Node.js runtime, even if the source code for the application is a language that transpiles to JavaScript, such as TypeScript.
When beginning a debugging session, you must inspect the call stack and any scoped variables in their current state. You can also evaluate expressions in the editor and step through the code to drill into the problematic parts.
Setting up a project for Node.js debugging is not particularly difficult, and this tutorial will help you get it right on the first try!
Before beginning, ensure the most recent versions of both Node.js and Visual Studio Code are installed. This tutorial uses …</span>

                    <span>In this article, we&#x27;ll explore how you can easily update npm packages used in your application without worrying about breaking the application functionality.
So let&#x27;s get started.
Semantic versioning is such an important thing that, every developer needs to understand it whether you are a Node, React or Angular developer.
It’s also one of the frequently asked interview questions.
It defines how to manage the dependencies of npm packages that we install.
So let&#x27;s understand some basics.
When we create any new Node or React project from scratch we execute the following command:
npm init -y

OR 

yarn init -y

This will create a basic package.json file where we can manage the dependencies of packages.
Normally, the package.json will look like this.

As you can see, package.json has a specifie…</span>

                    <span>In the past I had explained how to use redis as an external source to store and access cached data. If you are interested, read this article.
However, not all solutions require the use of an external source. In case you have no idea how big the application will reach in the early days, using an internal cache can save you a lot of deployment time.
But you have to pay attention to one thing, if your application grows fast or if you already have a good number of daily requests, I always recommend using an external source. This is because by storing data in your application&#x27;s cache, you will increase your application&#x27;s memory leaks.
I know a lot of people who don&#x27;t care about memory leaks, however, if your application consumes a lot of RAM, the system may interrupt the application&#x27;s execution…</span>

                    <span>10 Tips for Safe and Secure Remote Working


Modern employees require more flexibility than their previous counterparts. 
54% of employees say they’d rather shift to a career that offers them more flexibility. In other words, organizations are more likely to retain employees if they offer flexible work arrangements.
But shifting from in-person work to remote work comes with a full host of changes (and something to keep in mind when starting a business). The most crucial one? Making sure your remote team is set up to work safely and securely. 
But before we touch on 10 tips to improve your remote team’s security, let’s take a look at the importance of safe and secure remote working.

                    <span>📚 How to issue Verifiable Credentials from Auth0 user data using #MATTR&#x27;s #Auth0 Marketplace Integration.



  
  
  
TL;DR: This blog post illustrates how to implement verifiable credentials using MATTR&#x27;s Auth0 Marketplace integration. Our example features a fictitious university that issues digital credentials for students to use at various retail and hospitality locations—the university benefits by reducing the cost to produce and maintain physical ID cards. Students minimize PII (personally identifiable information) exposure with third-party organizations and the university (i.e., where their credentials are presented).
ACME University, a (fictitious) prestigious educational institution, has been an Auth0 customer since late 2016. ACME uses Auth0 to store data about all its students a…</span>

                    <span>Two general techniques can be used to provide copy protection for a software application. Programs can be protected digitally using software or physically with a copy protection dongle. 
While using software may seem like a simpler method, keeping your software safe from piracy can be difficult. The software used to protect your program can be hacked, rendering it useless as a defensive measure.
Tenacious hackers can subvert the detection and encryption mechanisms put in place to keep them away from protected software resources. Using a physical form of defense like a USB copy protection dongle provides an additional level of security that must be breached to gain access to the projected resource. It’s not a perfect method but is widely used by software developers to protect their work.

                    <span>The graph is a data structure that consists of vertices (or nodes) that can be connected to other vertices by edges.

The degree is the number of edges that are connected to a vertex, for example, the vertex A has a degree of 1 and the vertex C has a degree of 2.
Graphs can be either directed or undirected, directed graphs are like a one-way street, undirected is like a two-way street.

Graphs can also have cycles.

Graphs might be a disconnected one, that means it consists of isolated subgraphs, or a connected one, in which all every pair of nodes are connected by an edge.

Graphs can be used to represent networks, websites structure, also used in path optimization algorithms, there are applications in other fields, such as linguistics, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, etc.

Having a fast build means you&#x27;ve got a faster feedback loop and less risk of having to context switch due to getting distracted.
esbuild is &quot;An extremely fast JavaScript bundler&quot; and in this tutorial, I&#x27;m going to show you how we can accomplish blazingly fast builds for Typescript Serverless Framework projects, all while drastically reducing the configuration complexity compared with the alternatives.

Make it build
Does it work?
The Good
The Bad


What can we solve with scripting?
Today we&#x27;re going to try something that will definitely work, it&#x27;s just a question of how bad a developer-experience we&#x27;ll end up with: We&#x27;ll compile our Typescript libraries into Javascript.
This will work because it cuts Typescript entirely out of the dependency equation, but it&#x27;ll also drive a huge wedge into our workflow because now changes to source-code has to be compiled before it can be seen by consumers. And I suspect we&#x27;ll find other downsides too.
Hopefully we can fix or alleviate those problems with some tooling or scripting, but this article isn&#x27;t meant to uncover  the golden solution that&#x27;ll end this article-series… It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m so very tired of hitting errors that I wa…</span>

How do I use this at work?
Much like in the first tutorial I use this to help create a clickable prototype directly in the code base. This allows our users and SMEs to see the new features and flows directly in the context of the website they are currently familiar with. 
This works really well when you are working to fold a new user experience into an existing system. 
This also works great for new systems when I’m helping businesses transition from keeping their data and business processes in an excel spreadsheet to an application with business intelligence. I usually do a prototype…</span>

                    <span>Automatic global type augmentations with intellisense



If you ever wanted to add methods to a built-in type like Number or String in JavaScript, you could extend the prototype directly:
// Add helper function to number
Object.defineProperty(Number.prototype,&#x27;clamp&#x27;,{

    enumerable: false,
    value: function(min, max) {
        return Math.min(Math.max(min, this), max);
    }
});

// Add setter to allow defining shortcuts for dom elements
Object.defineProperty(HTMLElement.prototype,&#x27;shortcut&#x27;,{
    enumerable: false,
    set: function() {
        this._shortcut &#x3D; value;
        // register key-bindings etc
    }
});

Now, if we try to use these functions, the type-checker will flag it as errors, and intellisense will not work:
(10).clamp(5,15) // Property &#x27;clamp&#x27; does not exist on type…</span>

However it&#x27;s easy to misuse the ternary operator for things where simpler operators could often have been a better choice. So here are some alternatives for common mistakes.

                    <span>When writing front-end tests, you’ll find a lot of pitfalls along the way. In sum, they can lead to lousy maintainability, slow execution time, and — in the worst case — tests you cannot trust. But it doesn’t have to be that way. In this article, I will talk about common mistakes developers make, at least in my experience, and, of course, how to avoid them. Testing doesn’t need to be painful, after all.</span>

                    <span>Angular is a powerful feature-rich platform that you can use to create all kinds of single-page apps, ranging from simple sites to more intricate ones. With it, you can build efficient native, web, and mobile apps with a wide range of tools and libraries it integrates. However, there are still ways apps built with it can be improved. For example, using Angular Universal, you can render your apps server-side to speed up page loads and improve SEO and performance.
Server-side rendering involves converting an app to HTML on a server. When you send a request for a particular path to the server, it returns an entirely static HTML page as a response. No additional requests need to be made to populate the page with data and resources as it is all contained in the response. The page appears almost…</span>

Grayscale release, also known as canary release.
The term &quot;canary&quot; stems from the tradition of coal miners bringing caged canaries into mines. Miners use canaries to detect the concentration of carbon monoxide in the mine. The canaries would be poisoned by high concentration of carbon monoxide, in this case miners should evacute immediately. - DevOps Practice Guide
When we use &quot;grayscale&quot; or &quot;canary&quot; in software development. It refers to a small number of users&#x27; test before official release. So the problems can be detected earlier to prevent them from affecting most users.
Pipeline with grayscale release module is a very important tool and an efficient practice in DevOps, but I knew little about this when I was a student. After onboarding, I discovered the power of pipelines.

                    <span>Frameworks such as Angular, Vue.js, React or more recently, Blazor allow you to build highly dynamic applications based on a set of static files. Hosting these applications everywhere should be simple, but the catch is that the entry point will typically be an index.html file that holds the main application logic and connects everything together.
To work around this, you are usually forced to use a .htaccess file or special server configuration to route all of your requests to the correct destinations. This issue makes hosting frontend framework applications cumbersome in a cloud storage scenario.
However, we believe that bunny.net Edge Storage is a perfect home for these files. Not only is deployment extremely easy, but we also distribute and host these files in 5 different regions around…</span>

The main purpose of this file is to hold various metadata releted to the project and it is used to give information to npm that allows to identify the project and its dependencies.
To create a package.json file manually you need to run a command npm init which will ask you a bunch of questions that is not compulsory. Just hit enter to complete those.You can change it later.
npm init -y which will create a file named package.json with the defaults.

In this Navigation Menu, we used Angular Material components and also modify CSS classes. Here we used a menu with and ripple effects on clicks. Also, we used a responsive side Expansion Panel. To show all sub-links in expandable details views. To make a clickable toggle we used material icons and functions. These fully responsive and mobile-friendly elements.

A lightweight TypeScript library for creating particles. Dependency free (*), browser ready and compatible with React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, jQuery, Preact, Inferno
         
This library is available on the two most popular CDNs and it&#x27;s easy and ready to use, if you were using particles.js it&#x27;s even easier.
You&#x27;ll find the instructions below, with all the links you need, and don&#x27;t be scared by TypeScript, it&#x27;s just the source language.
The output files are just JavaScript. 🤩
CDNs and npm have all the sources you need in Javascript, a bundle browser ready (tsparticles.min.js) and all files splitted for import syntax.
If you are still interested some lines below there are some instructions for migrating from the old particles.js library.

This is for if you have troubles downloading large files while on a company network, or want to download files faster using Linux or Mac. 
1). Download aria2
Through brew: brew install aria2

Other systems: https://aria2.github.io/

Ubuntu Example:




2). cd to your downloads directory.
3). Run the following command:
aria2c --file-allocation&#x3D;none -c -x 10 -s 10 $URL

4). Replace $URL with the download URL of the file you are trying to pull.
On the corporate network, downloading the docker for mac was taking upwards of an hour. 
Downloading with aria2c:

The download was much quicker due to multi-threaded downloads! 😄
Credit to Aria2 for an awesome downloading tool!
Credit to hmj6jmh on StackOverflow for the solution they posted to &quot;How to make wget faster or multithreading?&quot; which helped me solve my frustration downloading while on corporate networks.</span>

If you are a software developer then you must be familiar with Git. Git is vastly used for version/revision control for software development for controlling source code.
It is a distributed revision control system. Git is better than SVN for speed, data integrity and also support non-linear workflows. 
Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development purpose. Yes you read it correct.
he creator of the Linux kernel designed and developed Git. Git was initially used for updating source code of the Linux kernel from around the world. 
Like any other version control systems, every Git working directory has a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities.

I earned my Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Chemical Engineering 15 years ago and  MBA from a prestigious university counted as IIT.
For Many years, I worked as a government banker, ministry nodal officer, etc to ensure rollouts of biometric and technology-based financial inclusion in four Indian states. It was a difficult job in 2010-2015, because we were living in the era of GPRS and 2G connectivity. Later,with launch of 3G things got streamed line.

                    <span>In this mini-tutorial, you will learn how to write a Makefile for automating stuff from project builds to whatnot, which is executed by the make command in Linux
Cause it&#x27;s used in many many projects for building stuff cause when you have to compile thousands of files for a project and ensure that each file is older than the compiled file, then Makefile saves the day!
Imagine you have a project which has tons of files dependent on one or another and they need to be compiled at once, compiling them manually is gonna take way too much time!
Also, if you are compiling a file that is already compiled from the latest version of the source file, then you would be compiling it again (what a waste of time and resources!).
You can write a script file for automating the whole process but for ensurin…</span>

While it&#x27;s great that we have a variety of managed cloud services to lift this complexity for us, it&#x27;s not a bad thing if we want to learn about some basic knowledge of setting up your own server. In fact, I come across this situation, and having this kind of knowledge is essential to me, especially when running a small project all by yourself or run with a tight budget.
Without further ado, let&#x27;s start:
This is true, especially if you don&#x27;t familiar with the Linux tools or come from a Windows background. There&#x27;s a lot of setup and maintenance hurdles that come when you start to manage your own server. And definitely, you don&#x27;t want to memorize all the things using onl…</span>

A ideia aqui é mostrar os princípios do docker de forma muito breve trazendo um pouquinho de clareza na hora de construir uma aplicação seja ela na linguagem que for.
Ao final desse tutorial, vamos conseguir fazer um CRUD sem ter &quot;nada instalado na nossa máquina&quot;, único requisito que precisamos é ter o docker instalado no computador.

Today I begin my 100daysofcode adventure. My goals are pretty clear.
Commit to One Hour per day to learn NodeJS
Finish Udemy NodeJS Course
Build API Project using Node as the back end, React as the front and Tailwind for styling.
Document my journey, which should help me and hopefully other gain a better understanding of NodeJS.
Pretty clear and straight forward. Wish me luck.</span>

                    <span>Our goal at Knock is to empower people to move freely. A large part of achieving that goal is to make real estate transactions as easy and seamless as possible for our customers. Real estate transactions are very complicated. Calling them a &quot;big ball of mud&quot; is being gracious. If we could sum up such transactions up in one image, it would be the image of Charlie Day explaining how a person named Pepe Silvia doesn&#x27;t exist:

For us as an engineering team, this translates into a lot of complex business logic. And we want to do our best to make sure that logic is sound. If our logic is faulty it can lead to thousands of dollars of disappointment. We do not want that. Thus, we thoroughly test our code via unit testing.
We are in a growth stage at Knock so we are regularly bringing on new engineers. During this process we have learned that it can be difficult for new engineers to come to grips with our testing code base while at the same time recognizing the patterns and strategies used in our unit tests. As a result, we have started a new open repository that provides lessons for any engineer to learn from and reference. We think this repository fills a gap in the community and are thus making it available for anyone to reference and contribute to: https://github.com/knockaway/unit-test-patterns-and-strategies.
Have we missed any patterns or strategies? We welcome pull requests to add more. And if you&#x27;re looking to join a team that cares about the quality of their code, we&#x27;re hiring!</span>

Strapi is a headless CMS(Content Management System) for Nodejs to build and develop APIs, and its content super-fast and accessible in a friendly UI.
It is also self-hosted, meaning you can build your APIs in the UI, and Strapi will still host and server the API endpoints for you. With this, you can push your Strapi server to any cloud host for the world to use your APIs.
APIs are built-in Strapi in the name of collections, although they now support single-type API. For example, this collection will provide endpoints on all the HTTP verbs: POST, PUT, DELETE, GET.
For example, if we create a collections Animals. Strapi will provide us wit…</span>

The main purpose of this file is to hold various metadata releted to the project and it is used to give information to npm that allows to identify the project and its dependencies.
To create a package.json file manually you need to run a command npm init which will ask you a bunch of questions that is not compulsory. Just hit enter to complete those.You can change it later.
npm init -y which will create a file named package.json with the defaults.
Let&#x27;s see the list of available options which npm has given us to make in this file.

                    <span>For a self-thought developer like myself who basically dabbled into backend development, php was probably a more welcoming language. A great community and an easy to digest syntax. I’m pretty sure when you wrote your first program that worked on the browser you felt pretty badass. 
Going on as you advance, from an absolute beginner to a beginner (lol), you probably start to get erky with the amount of extra software to run a server. Database management and server maintenance which comes with apache pretty much helps a lot in reducing the difficulty with setting up and maintaining a database. 
So if you are a frontend developer looking to learn backend technologies, php might be a great start, but if you are conversant with JavaScript, to reduce the extra time spent learning new syntax, it might be better to stick with Nodejs. 
Nodejs is a JavaScript framework that gives you more control in managing the backend of your web based application.

  Assert


Exibe uma mensagem caso a expressão passada resulte em falha. Sua mensagem pode ser tanto uma String, Array ou Objeto.
Detalhe, caso esteja usando Node.js, os efeitos são diferentes. Caso a expressão falhe, será gerado um AssertionError.
Exibe uma lista interativa das propriedades do objeto. Muito útil para analisarmos algum elemento HTML, checar propriedades.

Com Dir teremos uma interação melhor:

Exibe dados em forma de tabela de um Objeto ou Array. muito útil para termos uma visão melhor e limpa dos dados do que apenas o console.log() nos mostra. Veja exemplo a seguir:
A iteração do Array simples temos a coluna de índice e outra com valor, ja um Array multidimensional temos mais colunas de acordo com sua dimensão, ja um Objeto temos suas Chaves e Valores bem claros a vista.
Iniciar um cronômetro com console.time() e finaliza apenas quando for chamado console.timeEnd(). Muito útil caso tenha um aparte do seu código que você deseja saber quanto tempo leva de execução. Veja exemplo a seguir:
No final da execução será exibido tempo que o Time foi aberto ate TimeEnd ser chamado.
Similar ao Log, porem Warn exibe uma mensagem de alerta e Error exibe uma mensagem de Erro. Muito útil para especificar quando e uma falha maleável e quando ocorrer um erro de fato. Veja exemplos:

Por fim, o método Clear limpa o console, se o ambiente permitir.
Vemos que nem de console.log() pode viver um desenvolvedor Javascript. Espero que este conteúdo tenha agregado mais conhecimento.</span>

You can solve the problem a great deal by getting a security tool that automates the process for you. Additionally, it helps to revops your business.
That being said, there are steps that can help you in preventing security threats to a certain extent. Today, in this post, we are going to look at the different dimensions of e-commerce security and the proven measures that enhance it.
E-commerce security is one of the most important aspects of running a successful e-commerce store. While there is a whole range of e-commerce security threats one needs to watch out for, implementing a few measures does the trick in stopping them.

Cloud computing has seen a shift from traditional Java deployments to application servers like Tomcat to highly dynamic environments such as serverless and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
Many of the benefits of these new cloud platforms rely on their ability to quickly spin application instances up to meet additional demand and restart applications to adapt to infrastructure changes like operating system upgrades or virtual machine provisioning.
Deploying Java to these environments has been a challenge, though, largely due to the amount of time it takes even a basic Java web application to start, called the cold boot time. It is not uncommon to have to wait 30 seconds or more before your application can begin serving traffic, which becomes a problem on platforms that scale down to zero waiting for incoming traffic and expect to quickly launch an application to process a request.
Quarkus is a container native platform that addresses many of these performance issues, and in this blog post, we&#x27;ll take a look at a simple Quarkus web application exposing a REST endpoint protected by Auth0.
Quarkus has been designed to address the needs of serverless and container environments by reducing startup times and memory consumption. Perhaps the most exciting thing about Quarkus is its tight integration with GraalVM to allow applications to be compiled into native binaries.
Quarkus integrates with a huge range of libraries, giving developers access to many familiar platforms and allowing for the migration of existing code bases. These libraries are selected or customized to run seamlessly on Quarkus and to be able to take advantage of native compilation.
Of course, authentication is a central requirement of any modern web application, and Quarkus has out of the box support for OAuth, which in turn can be integrated into Auth0.

When a hacker gains access to the system administrator&#x27;s account by exploiting the online platform&#x27;s vulnerabilities, especially in two areas: credential management and session management, this is known as broken authentication. Only a confirmed user is permitted into the system, ensuring that the consumer&#x27;s identity is protected.

OWASP Top Web Application Security Risks is a must-follow guide for every web developer (and mobile as well). When you hire a software development company, make sure that they are not only familiar with OWASP but also follow it.
Of course, every app development process should include a code review. Nevertheless, it is wise to use automation security as well. Ensure that the developer team who works on your software, uses tools to double-check the security of your product. One of the most popular security tools is Sonar Cube.

Most of the time, it looks like a bug for us, but it is not.
Let&#x27;s start from type system itself.
type User &#x3D; {
    name: string;
}

Is it possible to mutate this type?
How would you change the type of name property to number?
There are several ways to do this:
type User &#x3D; {
    name: string;
}

type User1 &#x3D; User &amp; {
    name: number;
}

type User2 &#x3D; {
    [P in keyof User]: P extends &#x27;name&#x27; ? number : User[P]
}

type User3 &#x3D; Omit &amp; { name: number }

As you might have noticed, non of them mutate the type, only overrides the property.
I think this is the most natural way of dealing with object…</span>

                    <span>NestJS es un framework para backend (inicialmente) que la está empezando a romper y me atrevo a pensar que se volverá estándar poco a poco en la industria. Basado en Express, pero dándole un upgrade importante con TypeScript. Si has programado Angular en sus versiones recientes creo que te será bastante conocido.

                    <span>Code Snippets extensions are gaining popularity with VS Code developers. These extensions help developers generate common blocks of code using easy-to-recall shortcut sequences. 
The Marketplace now offers a large number of extensions that contain entire libraries of ready-to-use snippets for different languages and frameworks.
These snippets can help declare code more efficiently, with:
Fewer keystrokes,
Fewer mistakes,
Reduced physical strain, and
An overall lower cognitive load.
Some of you may already be familiar with CodeRush for Visual Studio. Our snippets are called Code Templates in this product. CodeRush Templates generate code in a similar way, but also provide significantly more power than what you would find in a typical collection of snippets.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s say you need an object with the shape of Record. You fire up your IDE and write down something like this:
type A &#x3D; { s: string };
type B &#x3D; { n: number };
type C &#x3D; { b: boolean };

type MyObject &#x3D; Record;

Great, you can now type check your object literals:
const o1: MyObject &#x3D; {
  a: { s: 1 }, // error: Type &#x27;number&#x27; is not assignable to type &#x27;string&#x27;.
};

// all good
const o2: MyObject &#x3D; {
  a: { s: &quot;str&quot; },
};

Open in TS playground →
Some time later you decide that you need to know the type of o.a, but it can&#x27;t be inferred! Due to the MyObject type reference, the object literal type information is lost and all you are left with is A | B | C:
type T &#x3D; typeof o2.a; // &#x3D;&gt; A | B | C

Open in TS playground →
Moreover, because string is used as an indexed access type of Record, TS will not warn you about the non-existent property access:
// TS guess:      &#x60;A | B | C&#x60;
// Harsh reality: &#x60;undefined&#x60;
const value &#x3D; o2.j;

Open in TS playground →
The autocomplete is also not available in this case.
Fortunately, we can leverage the power of generics to both type check the object literal and preserve type information:
type Constraint &#x3D; Record;

function identity(x: T): T {
  return x;
}

const o &#x3D; identity({
  a: { s: &quot;a&quot; },
});

type T &#x3D; typeof o.a; // &#x3D;&gt; { s: string }

Open in TS playground →
The extends clause of the type parameter enforces the correct type of the object:
const o &#x3D; identity({
  a: { s: 1 }, // error: Type &#x27;number&#x27; is not assignable to type &#x27;string&#x27;.
});

Open in TS playground →
At the same time, the literal type information is preserved because the identity function returns exactly what it have received: T, which is the (literal) type of the object literal.

                    <span>Introduction


A strictly typed schema is one of the great benefits of using Graphql. This schema acts as a contract between the backend and the frontend. When working on products that use Graphql as the backend API layer, I observed 2 types of working arrangements between team members :
Same developer owns the backend work and the front end work. In this scenario the graphql schema evolves alongside the front end code and requirements.
Multiple (2 or more) developers of same or different teams collaborate on different parts of frontend and backend
This write-up aims to address the second point where developers working on different parts of the app or feature need to do the following things:

If you&#x27;re interested in Linux, a complete and open source operating system, you&#x27;ve likely encountered some &quot;how to&quot; guides. But learning Linux is more than just following instructions—it&#x27;s about understanding why you do what you do, and not just what to do.
As a beginner, knowing how to get started with Linux can be tricky. You may find yourself overwhelmed by the sheer number of resources out there. How do you choose? What&#x27;s going to work for you and your unique set of skills?

Of course, the first step is to get Linux on a computer. For new users, it&#x27;s not that hard—Linux is now available on everything from Chromebooks to Raspberry Pis.

                    <span>The internet of things (IoT) remains a popular subset of the information technology (IT) realm. However, despite its advancements, IoT is still in its infancy. By 2027, the global IoT market is estimated to be worth over $1,463.19 billion USD. 
With massive leaps in IoT technology and a rapidly changing landscape, IoT security is a budding concern. Here&#x27;s what you need to know about IoT security.

IoT security is tough to implement. A major contributing factor is the complexity of IoT and its many factors. Instead of the back end, there&#x27;s network security and physical device security to consider as well.
The current landscape values ease of use over security. As Manuel Pais points out in DZone&#x27;s guide to IoT, there&#x27;s an onus on plug-and-play capability. This prioritizes operability and usa…</span>

                    <span>A Fail2Ban installation monitors server access logs and automatically bans IP addresses of bots and attacking users in iptables. Fail2Ban analyses server logs and identifies a pattern where a suspicious user or bot is trying to access restricted areas on the server. Brute force attacks repeatedly fail and use combinations of login credentials on after another. Fail to ban can detect failed login attempts on SSH and Apache webserver.
Installation is straight forward update apt-get and run instal fail2ban as a root user. Theses are Debian/Ubuntu commands for CentOS yum would replace apt-get and paths/locations might differ for configuration files. Check this tutorial for non-Debian operating systems.

                    <span>Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed 📺 Demo | Source

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka</span>

There are already tools for linting and integration testing accessibility, but what about end-to-end testing with real assistive technology?
