The goal of this service was to act as a middleware layer; that way, clients not written in Salesforce could retrieve and update contact data stored in Salesforce. This backend service implemented its own caching layer to provide a faster response time and also cut down on the number of times Salesforce needed to be called.
In ‚ÄúLeveraging Salesforce Using a Client Written In Svelte,‚Äù I introduced a simple client written in Svelte, which made it possible to update the Salesforce data using an inline editor‚Äîagain, without actually using the Salesforce client.

                    <span>Today&#x27;s topic is Confirmation dialog box in Angular. It&#x27;s been a while since my last post, and this one might be pretty useful for Angular developers. In the following several passages I&#x27;ll try to answer several questions:
What is the confirmation box in Angular? 


What is the best confirmation dialog for Angular, and why? 


How to integrate it into any Angular project?


How it looks like?







  
  
  What is the confirmation box in Angular?


It is a simple popup that prevents unwanted actions, for example when the user clicks the delete button, the popup dialog should appear with the question: &quot;Are you sure you want to delete item data?&quot; and two buttons &quot;Confirm&quot; and &quot;Decline&quot;. That is an enhanced level of security needed in almost every professional application. 
It is the ngx-awesome-popup an open-source library made for Angular. It provides highly scalable options and styles to adapt to any angular project. The best part is it&#x27;s callable only from typescript so it can be used directly in services without HTML templates and it uses observables. 

npm i @costlydeveloper/ngx-awesome-popup



imports: [

    NgxAwesomePopupModule.forRoot(), 

    ConfirmBoxConfigModule.forRoot()

]



confirmBox() {

        const confirmBox &#x3D; new ConfirmBoxInitializer();

        confirmBox.setTitle(&#x27;Are you sure?&#x27;);

        confirmBox.setMessage(&#x27;Confirm to delete user: John Doe!&#x27;);

        confirmBox.setButtonLabels(&#x27;YES&#x27;, &#x27;NO&#x27;);



        // Choose layout color type

        confirmBox.setConfig({

            LayoutType: DialogLayoutDisplay.DANGER // SUCCESS | INFO | NONE | DANGER | WARNING

        });



        // Simply open the popup and listen which button is clicked

        confirmBox.openConfirmBox$().subscribe(resp &#x3D;&gt; {

            // do some action after user click on a button

            console.log(&#x27;Clicked button response: &#x27;, resp);

        });

    }

To look at the pattern and history of the contributors on how did they work on it or why have they designed this approach for the framework.

                    <span>If we use OnPush change detection strategy, immutability is helpful to ensure change detection works expectedly. 
One of the way to enforce immutability is using Immutable.js. However, using Immutable.js is not really straightforward. It adds another layer instead of using JS object directly e.g
const apps &#x3D; List([{ name: &#x27;slack&#x27; }, { name: &#x27;skype&#x27; }]);
apps.get(0); // { name: &#x27;slack&#x27; }

const app &#x3D; Map({ name: &#x27;slack&#x27; });
map.get(&quot;name&quot;); // &#x27;slack&#x27;

// Using Record if we want to access property directly
const AppRecord &#x3D; Record({
    name: &#x27;&#x27;
});

class App extends AppRecord {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }
}

const newApp &#x3D; new App({ name: &#x27;slack&#x27; });
newApp.name; // &#x27;slack&#x27;

We have to use get when using List and Map. Using Record could solve the issue, but if we have a very large object, using Record will be hard to maintain because we need to create each record per object and it&#x27;s nested object.
Other issue is about JS compatibility because it needs to use fromJS and toJS methods to convert from and to JS object. 
I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;m not a fan of that lib and it makes things more complicated. 
Other possible approach I&#x27;m thinking of: 
readonly + ESLint immutable


Since Angular using Typescript, let&#x27;s use Readonly, ReadonlyArray to enforce immutability. 
Also add this no-mutation ESLint rule as extra protection https://github.com/jonaskello/eslint-plugin-functional/blob/master/docs/rules/immutable-data.md
is there any better approach?

I want to talk to you about observability, the art of understanding errors and performance of your technology stack by implementing monitoring and some kind of tool to view that monitoring.
Listen, if you&#x27;re making money as an engineer in the tech industry, you&#x27;re doing a good job. Functional? Object-oriented? Microservices? One big scary monolith? 
If what you do is paying for groceries and keeping a roof over your head then it&#x27;s good code, good architecture, and you have nothing to apologize for.

if this thing pays the bills it&#x27;s good technology
So when I say &#x27;I can&#x27;t believe you&#x27;re not doing observability&#x27; it&#x27;s not about whether your technology is good in any absolute, Manichean sense. I completely understand how observability can seem like a reach goal, a ni‚Ä¶</span>

This is because with Heroku, getting an application up and running is a very simple procedure that abstracts the underlying infrastructure and its scaling needs. However, with more applications running on Heroku is a growing bill even when no traffic is being served. AutoIdle is a Heroku add-on  that helps cut your Heroku bill by automatically putting your staging and review apps to sleep when you don&#x27;t need them. In this article, we shall see how we can install AutoIdle on a Heroku app and review apps in a pipeline and observe how much we save.

Right! So we have logs. We can use CloudWatch Logs Insights to query it, we can observe it through CloudWatch logs, and we can do many, many things with them now. Finally, we have them!
AWS gives us another tool, called Contributor Insights. This service can be used to analyze logs, create time series and display this data. That&#x27;s quite powerful!

Go to CloudWatch service, Contributor insights. Click Create rule. In the dropdown Log group(s) select our API logs. For the first time, select Sample rule, API Gateway and Calls by route and HTTP method (CLF). In fact, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you select JSON or CLF (in this case).

Keep rest of configuration as it is.

                    <span>Recap


What did we do so far? We enabled tracing on API and Lambda and we enabled enhanced monitoring for Lambda as well. We should do one more thing in order to start collecting information in proper way
By default logs for API Gateway are disabled.
In API service navigate to your API, then Stages, Prod (if you created the resource from the template), select Logs/Tracing tab (yes, you were here before). For the test enable all three settings and change level to INFO.

Trigger your API multiple times to generate logs. After this you should see API logs in CloudWatch.

Ok, it is time to add it to our SAM template. But wait! It is not &quot;just add&quot;. Unfortunately, we need to rewrite almost whole template.

I am unable to see my changes, even though I am using the referencing the image using the Correct Tag.
Or even worse:

These are normal problems to face do the basic design of Docker&#x27;s image management.
But before diving in, let&#x27;s see thee terminology that we&#x27;ll be talking about.
Human understandable reference to an Image used to convey information about that variant. An image can be tagged with multiple tags and can be referenced using any.

We&#x27;re developing a large React Native app which relies heavily on native components already written in Java, C++, and Objective-C. This means that we needed to develop, build, and test many different platforms on complex developer environments and build tools, that change often with platform updates.
This became a burden for our teams, with knowledge spread across many developers, installation guides, readme files, and internal wiki pages. It became expected that installations would take several days, and even a minor change in a dependency version resulted in inconsistent builds with obscure error messages.

                    <span>It&#x27;s spooky season! So in this post, we&#x27;re going to explore how to avoid being haunted by content you thought you deleted ‚Äî but actually didn&#x27;t. 
If you&#x27;re hosting a static website using AWS S3, one of the easiest ways to update your site is with the sync CLI command:
aws s3 sync  

Whether you&#x27;re running the command manually or as part of a CI/CD pipeline, it&#x27;s important to note that, by default, it will only add content.
This means that even if you intended to remove a page from your site and removed all links to it, the page could still be accessed by navigating to it directly.

In order to delete non-existing content using this command, you&#x27;ll have to use the --delete flag.
aws s3 sync   --delete

Just be careful to only use the --delete flag when you actually want to delete content that isn&#x27;t present in the source directory.
In general, it&#x27;s a good idea to run S3 CLI commands with the --dryrun flag to show what actions would be performed without actually performing them.
aws s3 sync   --delete --dryrun

To read more about this command and other available options, see the documentation.

                    <span>This article mainly discusses encountered issues and solutions when I installed VirtualBox Guest Additions for OpenEuler 20.03 SP1.
After installing openEuler 20.03 SP1, log in to openEuler (I login as root here, if you are a regular user, you may need to use sudo when executing commands below), and then click Device -&gt; Insert Guest Additions CD image... to load the latest version of the Guest Additions CD into the system.


Mount the CD:




mkdir -p /run/media/openeuler/VBoxAdditions
mount /dev/sr0 /run/media/openeuler/VBoxAdditions
cd /run/media/openeuler/VBoxAdditions


If you choose to install directly as usual, it may prompt an error for extraction because the system lacks the tar extraction program in the case of minimal installation. So install it:

Ubuntu 21.10 can load on my computer through secure boot, and the shim version is 15.4. Then refer to the official tutorial, I installed rEFInd v0.13.2 (the latest version when I posted this blog) via PPA in Ubuntu 21.10. However, when I restart the system and load rEFInd, it always fails with the message Verification failed:(0x1A)Security Violation. I&#x27;m sure that both refind_local.cer and refind.cer under the EFI/refind/keys/ have been enrolled through MokManager (Although only refind_local.cer is needed through PPA installation).
From this post, I got that rEFInd currently (v0.13.2) lacks the .sbat section. For shim 15.3 and later versions, SBAT is mandatory, resulting in failure to start rEFInd.

After this is done we are going to write some shell script in our .sh file using the linux vi editor.
vi deploy.sh
The next step for you is to copy the code and past into the vi editor. But to do that you have to press the letter &quot;a&quot; to enable insert mode on the vi edit.

This tutorial walks you through setting up Kubernetes the hard way. This guide is not for people looking for a fully automated command to bring up a Kubernetes cluster. If that&#x27;s you then check out Google Kubernetes Engine, or the Getting Started Guides. the repo k8s-the-hard-way
Kubernetes The Hard Way is optimized for learning, which means taking the long route to ensure you understand each task required to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster.
The results of this tutorial should not be viewed as production ready, and may receive limited support from the community, but don&#x27;t let that stop you from learning!
The target audience for this tutorial is someone planning to support a production Kubernetes cluster and wants to understand how everything fits together.

Login in
Click on &quot;Create Post&quot;
Write the content of your post using Markdown
Click on &quot;Publish&quot;
You can also use the DEV API for creating a new post. According to the documentation, you can create a new post using curl:
curl -X POST -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \
 -H &quot;api-key: API_KEY&quot; \
 -d &#x27;{&quot;article&quot;:{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Title&quot;,&quot;body_markdown&quot;:&quot;Body&quot;,&quot;published&quot;:false,&quot;tags&quot;:[&quot;discuss&quot;, &quot;javascript&quot;]}}&#x27; \
 https://dev.to/api/articles

In the above command you must replace the value of:
title
body_markdown
published
tags
according to the details of your post.
title is the name of your post.
body_markdown is equal to the content of your post. You can create a Markdown file using an editor like ghostwriter and pass the content of that file‚Ä¶</span>

When I first heard about the event loop, the concept kind of made sense.
I knew that Node.js is single-threaded but also very fast at the same time. It&#x27;s using the event loop to handle thousands of concurrent requests. How exactly it accomplished that though, was a mystery to me.
I also knew not to block the event loop in Node.js otherwise server performance would suffer.
Everyone warned against blocking the event loop!
I was able to write asynchronous code that worked. I could also modify async code written by others without introducing new bugs (most of the time). But honestly, there were many moments where I had no idea why my code worked. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

                    <span>Stream data is very common in Nodejs. There is a module called Stream which provides an API for implementing the stream interface. Streams make for quite a handy abstraction, and there&#x27;s a lot you can do with them - as an example, let&#x27;s take a look at stream.pipe(), the method used to take a readable stream and connect it to a writeable stream.
A very common use for stream.pipe() is file stream.
const fs &#x3D; require(&quot;fs&quot;);
let readStream &#x3D; fs.createReadStream(&quot;./myDataInput.txt&quot;);
let writeStream &#x3D; fs.createWriteStream(&quot;./myDataOutput.txt&quot;);

readStream.pipe(writeStream);

Above is a simple example shows that we use pipe to transfer the data from the read stream to the write stream.
However there is a problem when using the standard source.pipe(destination). Source will not be destroyed if the destination emits close or an error. You are not able to provide a callback to tell when then pipe has finished.
To solve this problem, we can use pipeline which introduced in Nodejs 10.x or later version. If you are using Nodejs 8.x or earlier, you can use pump.
const { pipeline } &#x3D; require(&#x27;stream&#x27;);
let readStream &#x3D; fs.createReadStream(&quot;./myDataInput.txt&quot;);
let writeStream &#x3D; fs.createWriteStream(&quot;./myDataOutput.txt&quot;);

pipeline(readStream, writeStream, error &#x3D;&gt; {
   if (error) {
      console.error(error);
   } else {
      console.info(&quot;Pipeline Successful&quot;)
   }
});


you may also read Backpressuring in Streams which explains more detail on why you should use pipeline.</span>

                    <span>Security is hard. It&#x27;s hard because there are so many things that can go wrong along the way. Attackers only need to find one small gap to make it through whereas developers and IT Pros have to think about all the possible attack permutations and potential security vulnerabilities every step of the way. That&#x27;s why we talk about &quot;security in layers&quot; when it comes to building systems that handle sensitive data. And unless you&#x27;re creating static marketing pages, it&#x27;s very likely that your solution will need to work with some data.
If you&#x27;re running on Azure (or other cloud providers) there are tools to help you keep your data secure both at rest and in transit. This is great document that can help you get a high level overview of Azure data security and encryption. And there are many more too‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Background


Ubuntu 21.10 can load on my computer through secure boot, and the shim version is 15.4. Then refer to the official tutorial, I installed rEFInd v0.13.2 (the latest version when I posted this blog) via PPA in Ubuntu 21.10. However, when I restart the system and load rEFInd, it always fails with the message Verification failed:(0x1A)Security Violation. I&#x27;m sure that both refind_local.cer and refind.cer under the EFI/refind/keys/ have been enrolled through MokManager (Although only refind_local.cer is needed through PPA installation).
From this post, I got that rEFInd currently (v0.13.2) lacks the .sbat section. For shim 15.3 and later versions, SBAT is mandatory, resulting in failure to start rEFInd.

                    <span>Recently at work, I came across an interesting method to handle encryption at scale called envelope encryption. 
First of all, it increases security and helps you ease out the management of encryption keys. But it&#x27;s also a highly recommended pattern by PCI-DSS (Security Standard for Credit Card Processing) and results in much stronger data privacy and data protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). 
When we think of data there are 3 places we can think of encrypting data:
At Rest - On hardware storage devices like on a disk or in your devices 
In Transit - In moving data between different locations like server to server through API calls
In Use - While it&#x27;s being used by a server (New concept and still being researched)
We will be dealing primarily with encryption at rest and‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>This post is about an interesting problem that relates to crossing the boundary between a SQL database and code; spoiler alert: it has to do with a little known yet broadly relevant security pitfall.
Suppose you have a user database with extremely sensitive data, and also data that is less sensitive.
You wish to protect your most sensitive data, so you restrict access to it to some database users. Only privileged database credentials - available to a few micro-services and employees at the company - can grant read access to the data.
For example, in a typical SQL database like Postgres, this is possible through GRANT/REVOKE:
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE secret_user_data TO privileged_user;
REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE secret_user_data FROM basic_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE basic_user_data TO ba‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Authentication


Authentication is a process of proving and recognizing user‚Äôs correct identity. Generally, it deals with an individual‚Äôs username, password, OTP verification, and some type of additional verifications.

Single-Factor Authentication (SFA)
Two-factor Authentication (2FA)
Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
Token Authentication
Certificate-based Authentication
Biometric Authentication
Single-Factor Authentication is a widely used form of authentication. An user‚Äôs identity can be verified using username and password or pass code or other simple codes.
Like SFA, 2FA also uses username and password with an additional verification code that will be available on their owned device (mobile). This is an extra layer of protection to confirm their identity. For example, by enabling two ‚Ä¶</span>

Welcome to the third Type | Treat challenge! These challenges are a series of blog posts which have 2 code challenges in, one for beginners and one for intermediate TypeScript programmers. We&#x27;re on day three, which means going over the answers from yesterday and have 2 new challenges.
There is many ways to decide how to type existing data, you could use literal types when you&#x27;re sure of the exact formats - or be more liberal and use string when you expect a variety. We opted for literals, but using string is totally cool too.

There&#x27;s a debate to be had about whether using JavaScript or TypeScript leads to better outcomes when building a project. The advent of using JSDoc annotations to type a JavaScript codebase introduces a new dynamic to this discussion.
In this guide, we&#x27;ll investigate what that looks like and come to an (opinionated) conclusion.
If you&#x27;d talked to me in 2018, I would have solidly recommended using TypeScript and steering away from JavaScript.
The rationale is simple: I&#x27;m exceedingly convinced of the value that static typing provides in terms of productivity and avoiding bugs in production. I appreciate this can be a contentious issue, but that is my settled opinion on the subject. Other opinions are available.
TypeScript has long had a good static typing story. Bec‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Why should you use Typescript?


Simple. It solves your problem. Let&#x27;s see.
Type checking: This is why typescript really exists. It adds type checking over javascript. It stops you to write stupid code.

Let&#x27;s see an example:
const addNums &#x3D; (a, b) &#x3D;\u003e {
return a + b
}

a and b should be numbers. But you stupidly pass strings.
addNums(&#x27;1&#x27;, &#x27;2&#x27;)

output:
&#x27;12&#x27;

We don&#x27;t want this to happen. It was a stupid example. But if you are working on a bigger project, this kind of bug can happen easily. You waste hours and hours to fix the code.

This is where typescript rescues us with type checking.
const addNums &#x3D; (a: number, b: number) &#x3D;\u003e {
return a + b
}

Now if you pass string it will give you an error so that you can fix it.

                    <span>Today&#x27;s topic is Confirmation dialog box in Angular. It&#x27;s been a while since my last post, and this one might be pretty useful for Angular developers. In the following several passages I&#x27;ll try to answer several questions:
What is the confirmation box in Angular? 


What is the best confirmation dialog for Angular, and why? 


How to integrate it into any Angular project?


How it looks like?







  
  
  What is the confirmation box in Angular?


It is a simple popup that prevents unwanted actions, for example when the user clicks the delete button, the popup dialog should appear with the question: &quot;Are you sure you want to delete item data?&quot; and two buttons &quot;Confirm&quot; and &quot;Decline&quot;. That is an enhanced level of security needed in almost every professional application. 
It is the ngx-awesome-popup an open-source library made for Angular. It provides highly scalable options and styles to adapt to any angular project. The best part is it&#x27;s callable only from typescript so it can be used directly in services without HTML templates and it uses observables. 

npm i @costlydeveloper/ngx-awesome-popup



imports: [

    NgxAwesomePopupModule.forRoot(), 

    ConfirmBoxConfigModule.forRoot()

]



confirmBox() {

        const confirmBox &#x3D; new ConfirmBoxInitializer();

        confirmBox.setTitle(&#x27;Are you sure?&#x27;);

        confirmBox.setMessage(&#x27;Confirm to delete user: John Doe!&#x27;);

        confirmBox.setButtonLabels(&#x27;YES&#x27;, &#x27;NO&#x27;);



        // Choose layout color type

        confirmBox.setConfig({

            LayoutType: DialogLayoutDisplay.DANGER // SUCCESS | INFO | NONE | DANGER | WARNING

        });



        // Simply open the popup and listen which button is clicked

        confirmBox.openConfirmBox$().subscribe(resp &#x3D;&gt; {

            // do some action after user click on a button

            console.log(&#x27;Clicked button response: &#x27;, resp);

        });

    }

                    <span>When i first started approaching reactive programming and rxjs i struggled a little bit to understand how data flows throught observables, pipes, operators and so on. All i had to help me were marble diagrams, but they just helped increasing the headache.
I wanted to create something that could help beginners approaching rxjs, while helping more experienced developers debug complex pipes. 
rx-debugger is born! 
Getting started with rx-debugger is super easy. All you have to do is patching source observable and using operators exported by the library. 
Here is an example:
import { rxDebugger, map, toArray } from &#x27;rx-debugger&#x27;;
import { of } from &#x27;rxjs&#x27;;

rxDebugger(of(1, 2, 3))
  .pipe(
    map((item) &#x3D;&gt; item * 2),
    toArray()
  )
  .subscribe();

Doing so, you will get following output nicely printed in the console:

By the way, rx-debugger supports way more options than just printing tables in the console. You can find all the options in the docs.
rx-debugger is open source and hosted on GitHub. While being fully functional, it is in early stages of development, and any help or feedback would be appreciated!</span>

We recently built a fun halloween experiment where we use something called pose detection to skeletonise your body in realtime using your body.

What in the world is pose detection, and why might I want to use it? Well in simple terms, it&#x27;s the process of taking an image or video, locating any bodies in the frame, and then figuring out where their body parts are.

In this post we look at how to get started using vanilla-extract with SvelteKit.  Before we get going though, we should spend a moment looking at what vanilla-extract is and why you might want to use in a project or at least try it out.
vanilla-extract is a modern Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) preprocessor, which generates plain CSS stylesheets.  It is TypeScript friendly and leans on TypeScript to add some extra useful features.  You can create your style in TypeScript files which sit alongside your Svelte code and import the styles, adding them as classes to your components.  The way you use them is similar to CSS modules usage pattern.

                    <span>Most of the time, we have been using data in an array type and we have been using a lot of functions to filter arrays.
If your using array for small amount of data, its fine since its just small amount of data. But if your working with a lot of data, might as well save it as an object.
Let&#x27;s us look at performance


When it comes to performance, getting data from an array takes time, cause you have to check every items inside an array.

                    <span>Introduction


Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
Supabase is an authentication service with simple tools to help developers build applications.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the account. Access the site https://supabase.io/ and click on the button Start your project.

2. Click on the button Continue with GitHub.

3. Fill in the fields Username or email address, Password and click on the button Sign in to login with your GitHub account and if you don&#x27;t have an account, click on the button Create an accou‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Grab some popcorn &#x27;cuz we&#x27;re here to talk about curl-bash pipelines on Linux. Personally I don&#x27;t like them for maintenance reasons (how do you remove things you installed like this?), and I want to nag my fellows to not casually run a wall-of-script fro the Internet.
When a bash shell is started at login it&#x27;s considered interactive and expects to be attached to a TTY. When we run curl https://example.com/script.sh | bash the bash process started is non-interactive and expects no human input. We can confirm a bash process&#x27; interactivity either by looking at the process table (run ps) or by checking the builtin variable $- (the shell&#x27;s starting arguments) for an &#x27;i&#x27; character.
Part of the classic Unix process model is that a process has a parent that created it and may have child processes t‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Theoretically, Azure Data Studio is all you need to manage Azure SQL databases on Linux, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work that way. I frequently end up with &quot;login failed for token-identified-principal&quot; after being connected for only a few minutes. This makes using Azure Data Studio an exercise in frustration, wondering what combination of operations will result in ADS just conking out on you until your token expires.
Azure SQL doesn&#x27;t support the standard T-SQL BACKUP and RESTORE commands, so getting a copy of your database for local development is somewhat challenging. The Azure Portal requires the AAD admin credentials, not something I want to give out to developers. Enter SqlPackage, which I have started preferring to both the Azure portal and ADS. SqlPackage for Linux is available at https://aka.ms/sqlpackage-linux.
A first attempt at copying the database from Azure might look like this:
sqlpackage /a:export /scs:&quot;Data Source&#x3D;...Initial Catalog&#x3D;...&quot; /ua:true /tid:&quot;mytenant.onmicrosoft.com&quot;
Indeed, that&#x27;s what I attempted. But UniversalAuthentication (required to authenticate with MFA) doesn&#x27;t seem to work as expected on Linux. You would expect that a browser would be launched to login to the application (since MFA won&#x27;t work without a browser). However, the command above doesn&#x27;t work.
Looking through the SqlPackage help, I see that there is a /AccessToken option. We can manually obtain an access token and use it to authenticate. Access tokens can be obtained using the Azure CLI, using the command az account get-access token --resource https://database.windows.net/. This will return a JSON body containing (among other things) the access token to use. Copy and paste this into an environment variable ACCESS_TOKEN, and then the full sqlpackage invocation becomes:
sqlpackage /a:export /at:&quot;$ACCESS_TOKEN&quot; /scs:&quot;Data Source&#x3D;...&quot; /ua:True ...</span>

                    <span>The Javascript concept &quot;this&quot; happens to be a tricky one to fully grasp and understand. To fully understand it, some core Javascript internals must be understood. 
Execution context
Scope
Lexical scope
Dynamic scope
Our Javascript code gets executed by the Javascript engine which creates an execution context. The execution context is like a small world or planet where our code run.
  function sayMyName(name){
    return name;
  }

//this simple function just returns the name passed on to it



&#x60; 
A scope is the visibility of a variable meaning, where that variable can be accessed. Scope are of types lexical and dynamic scope.
&#x60;

     let goodbye &#x3D; &quot;au revoir&quot;;

                    <span>What is Appwrite?


Appwrite is a self-hosted backend solution that enables developers get up and running with most of their backend needs in any project. Appwrite grants access to features like:
Storage (Media files)
Database (Documents)
Authentication (Manage Users)
Cloud Functions and more
and you can access these from REST APIs.
We&#x27;re going to be building a URL Shortener with Appwrite in this article.
Docker
Node 
Yarn (or npm but we&#x27;ll be using Yarn)
Working knowledge of Express
Head over to the Appwrite homepage and click on Get Started.

Copy the corresponding terminal command for your computer, ensure Docker is up and running, then run the command. Wait a while for the installation to be completed and you should see this.

                    <span>Whatsup guys. First I wanted to say that everyone in the dev.to community has been super welcoming and friendly. Nice to know there are still people out there.
The reason for this post. I started a site that is a network for developers to seek &amp; give advice over video chat. 
https://p-pl.com is the site
For instance, if you are an expert in React.js, you can have other people connect with you. You as an expert can also bill for your time. (Hourly rate)
Or if you&#x27;re seeking advice, you can search for and request to connect with other users that are online at that given moment. If they accept the call, you are immediately brought to the video chat portal to hash out your code issues or anything else.
Once the interaction ends, each user can rate eachother based on professionality, expertise etc. Think of it almost like an uber for information.
You as a user are ranked higher in the results based on your reviews as well as the meta data your provide in your profile.
This was a 2 1/2 year project and I just want it in the right hands. I will be posting tutorials later on how to use the site, core features etc.
What I&#x27;m looking to do is build the network full of JavaScript developers so that the community is rich with support in this language. Eventually then to move on to other languages.</span>

                    <span>Docker is a software platform that enables packaging an application into containers. These containers represent isolated environments that provide everything necessary to run the application. Dockerizing an application refers to packaging it in a Docker image to run in one or more containers.
Dockerizing an application involves specifying everything needed to run the application in a Dockerfile and then using the file to build a specialized Docker image that can be shared to multiple machines. A Docker image is a reproducible environment for the application that guarantees portability across machines.
In this tutorial, you&#x27;ll learn the process of Dockerizing an existing Node.js application from scratch. We&#x27;ll cover topics such as:

Let‚Äôs face it. We all make mistakes. Even the most diligent, well-intentioned employee can inadvertently open the floodgates to an attack. Telecoms giant Verizon illustrated this earlier this year, when it published the 2021 edition of its Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR).
The DBIR examined approximately 5,250 successful security breaches, gathering data about the methodologies used. It found 35 percent of attacks incorporated a social element. Of these, the vast majority (85%) used phishing tactics.
In short: you can deploy all the technological measures you want, but unless you address the human element, an attacker can defeat your defenses with a simple phone call or email.

I was doing a bit of bug-hunting in an old project of mine when I found an interesting bug. Can you find it?
If you know your security or PHP this might be quite easy for you. Otherwise, it might be a good exercise.
This is the request you would make to the server:
curl --location --request POST &#x27;https://super.secure-api.com/check-pin&#x27; \
    --header &#x27;Content-Type: application/json&#x27; \
    --header &#x27;Authorization: Bearer &#x27; \
    --data-raw &#x27;{
      &quot;pin&quot;: 
    }&#x27;

And this is the code for that given endpoint (/check-pin)
if($params[&#x27;pin&#x27;] !&#x3D; $user-&gt;getPin()) {
  throw new HttpException(403, &quot;The pin is incorrect&quot;);
}

return &quot;The pin is correct!&quot;;

PD: This is just a demo, not real code. You should never check passwords/pins/secrets like this.
pin to be able to bypass the check?


I will release a post in a couple of days explaining the bug in detail and how to fix it.</span>

Welcome to the second Type | Treat challenge! These challenges are a series of blog posts which have 2 code challenges in, one for beginners and one for intermediate TypeScript programmers. We&#x27;re on day two, which means going over the answers from yesterday and 2 new challenges.
The first part of the solution for this challenge used as const to trigger &quot;Literal Inference&quot; - basically telling TypeScript &quot;Don&#x27;t convert the array to string[] but consider it a constant set of string literals. This meant that playlist[0] stopped returning string and started returning &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow by The Monotones.mp3&quot;.

                    <span>Type or Treat Challenges


Today we&#x27;re starting up our second year of Type | Treat (or &quot;Type or Treat&quot;.) We will be presenting some &quot;spooky&quot; code challenges that will allow you to dig deeper into the TypeScript language in a fun way.
Starting right now, a new code challenge will be posted every weekday, along with its solution the day after. The last solution will be posted on the weekend.
In order to participate you only need to be able to access the TypeScript website. Though ideally, you share with us your answers via our dev.to blog post mirrors, here, or via Twitter to @TypeScript.
You will want to start here on the blog to find the details on the code challenges for the day. Each post contains 2 links to different challenges which run in the TypeScript playground. Via the playground,‚Ä¶</span>

DEMO HERE
REPO HERE
My first attempt was to use an interceptor service that contained a BehaviorSubject (Observable). I set it up to maintain a counter and set the observable&#x27;s value to true if there were more than zero (0) requests in-flight.
Through heavy use of the console.log functionality, I came to realize that the interceptor was not always active, even though I was following proper singleton patterns.
The second attempt went more smoothly.
I had a second service (a handler) that maintained the counts and the BehaviorSubject. This one worked &quot;like a charm.&quot;

                    <span>Validating tags in Angular Material does not work as it should out-of-the-box, so I am sharing my custom version. This assumes you are familiar with basic angular reactive forms, and are using Angular Material Chips to handle your tags input.
Here you will be able to produce min and required errors, as well as display them in mat-error as expected out-of-the-box. Unfortunately, Angular does not work this way out-of-the-box.
