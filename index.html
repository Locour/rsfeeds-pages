                    <span>Last week, I was having a problem in my current job, that basically we were refactoring stuffs in our code, and one of them was the Status Screen.
How to have a global Status for our API responses, without to have it as a Screen?
The response takes a bit to come for me, but, at evening the light came, why not use a High Order Component to get around this problem?!
So, let&#x27;s start doing it, first and formals, we are going to use React Native (Expo Bare-Workflow), to be able to get our results more quickly, but the same can be achieved using React Native CLI.
First, we&#x27;re going to init our project, as I&#x27;m using Expo, I&#x27;ll do:
expo init

After that, I&#x27;m going to select my workflow, based on expo. So I&#x27;ll select:

                    <span>Introduction


Angular uses reactive methods to process and manage form. It is easy to use reactive forms to capture user inputs events, validate the inputs and create form models in large angular applications. This enables the tracking of data and changes in the form model in all parts of the application.
Reactive forms provide a model-driven approach to handling form inputs whose values change over time. It uses an explicit and immutable approach to manage the form at a given point in time and it is built around observable streams.
Register the reactive form module in the app module declaration of an angular app. This module declares a reactive form directives needed to use the reactive form

                    <span>If you’re an Angular developer, you’re missing out if you’re not using advanced TypeScript features to help you build better code.
And it’s well worth the effort: TypeScript has some great features that can make you a stronger Angular developer. 💪
BigInt lets you represent numbers bigger than 253. This is useful when you need to perform mathematical operations on very large integers. And you can work directly with large integer IDs and high resolution timestamps.
You can create a bigint primitive in two ways:
const n0 &#x3D; 1n;
const n1 &#x3D; new BigInt(1);

There is no interoperability between bigint and number primitives, but they can be compared.
NOTE: BigInt support is only available for the esnext target.

First, in the tsconfig.json file at the root of the project, I clean up the imports and allow JSON files to be resolved on import, as shown ...
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    ...
    &quot;allowSyntheticDefaultImports&quot;: true,
    &quot;resolveJsonModule&quot;: true
   ...
  }
} 

In the assets folder, I define the mock-data in the following path ...
assets/mock-data/api/

For this article, assume there is a users.json file in the api folder.
Within the project, I create a config.json file that can be imported.

Let’s get started with the concept by understanding what it means for us and how it helps us build a Reactive application. This blog will focus on how to maintain state in Angular applications but the concepts are the same for all the component based frameworks including React and Vue Js.
State in application is the single source of truth containing the user contexts or other global information. Let us consider the scenario where you wanna build an application which will use login functionality. Let’s say you have multiple components using the login information to display the information about the login like Login name, email and your avatar, when you update any of these information you wan…</span>

CI stands for Continous Integration
CD stands for Continous Delivery or Continous Deployment
Let me explain through a example: 
When you make a commit and push sources to Git SCM(Source Code Management like Github, GitLab etc), then automatic builds and tests are run with the latest changes, this is knows as Continous Integration
With Continous Delivery, code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. Continuous delivery expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and put on a manual approval for adding them in production envirment.
Continous Deployment expands upon continuous delivery and pushed to production environment automatically without any approval.

                    <span>What is Docker? - &quot;build once and run anywhere.&quot;


Docker is a software development tool and a virtualisation technology that makes it easy to develop, deploy, and manage applications by using containers. Container refers to a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that contains all the libraries, configuration files, dependencies, and other necessary parts to operate the application.
In other words, applications run in the same way, irrespective of where they are and what machine they are running on because the container provides the environment throughout the software development lifecycle of the application. Since containers are isolated, they provide security, thus allowing multiple containers to run simultaneously on the given host. Also, containers are li…</span>

If you have skipped the last part, just to let you know, I need to configure a VPN.

Well, the VPN setup came up alright, I use OpenVPN and it works just fine.

We are all aware that Amazon Web Services is one of the most popular and used Cloud platforms. Most of us use AWS for hosting. When building apps, we might have different environments for development, staging, UAT, and production.
So if our app uses a web machine and a worker, then we have these same machines in all environments. For example, if we use a development and production environment, we will have 4 instances. But when compared to production instances, Our development environment will have low-end instances. But the low-end instance also adds cost to our billing.
We can reduce the development instance cost up to 60%. We can save this cost and use it in any other way. We will see how to cut down the cost.

                    <span>I’ve had a great conversation with a buddy of mine who is launching a new service, and while he is not a technical person, he came up to me asking about serverless and if it could have an actual impact on his startup. 
Naturally, I got very excited about the topic and proceeded to list all the benefits of serverless technology and how decentralized technology has revolutionized the industry, so on so forth. After a 15-minute monologue, the guy stops me and politely asks me the question again.
How does serverless affect early-stage startups, and how it differs from the traditional monolith architecture?
I was forced to look at the problem from a different angle. Big companies get tons of benefits from huge cost cuts, better security, and a way to scale their applications on-demand without a…</span>

                    <span>One of the CDK&#x27;s greatest strengths is the ability to create a library of components to be shared across your company, or shared with the world on constructs.dev. But how do you create a construct based on other constructs in the same stack without forcing the developer to call a method for each one? That&#x27;s exactly what aspects allow you to do.
You can find the final source for this tutorial at https://github.com/theBenForce/dynamo-dashboard
The CDK uses a four step process to convert your code into a CloudFormation template: construct, prepare, validate, and synthesize. Since aspects are used during the second step, you need to understand how the first two steps are related.

When you run a CDK command, it starts by executing your code. Usually this is some file in the project&#x27;s bin/ dire…</span>

                    <span>With a multi-account approach of building the infrastructure, there is always a challenge of provision and governance of the resources to subordinate accounts within the Organization. Provision resources, keep them up to date, and decommission them properly — that&#x27;s only a part of them.
AWS has numerous solutions that help make this process reliable and secure, and the Resource Access Manager (RAM) is one of them.
In a nutshell, the RAM service allows you to share the AWS resources you create in one AWS account with other AWS accounts. These can be your organizations&#x27; accounts, organizational units (OU), or even third-party accounts.
So let&#x27;s see what the RAM is and review some of its usage examples.

                    <span>The OpenSSH 8.8 is now in the stable channel of Arch Linux and could reach other distributions any time soon.
In the release 8.7, the OpenSSH team announced that the ssh-rsa signature scheme will be disabled by default in the next version: 8.8.
The ssh-rsa signature scheme uses SHA-1 and it&#x27;s sensible to chosen-prefix attacks.
This should not be a problem unless you are connecting to a server using the weak ssh-rsa public key algorithm for host authentication.
💡 If you&#x27;re using the version 8.7 or a previous one, you can test your remote hosts like a GitLab or a cloud server using:
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms&#x3D;-ssh-rsa user@host

If the connection fails, that means that the signature algorithm is not compatible with the default configuration of OpenSSH 8.8.
If you can&#x27;t upgrade the signature algorithm on your remote servers but you still need to use them, you can use the following command:
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms&#x3D;+ssh-rsa user@host

Right now, Bitbucket uses this weak signature algorithm, I guess you need to use your Git repositories hosted there. 🥺 You can check your connection with the following command:
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms&#x3D;+ssh-rsa git@bitbucket.org

How can we enable this flag for all the Git commands? An easy solution is coming... You can create an SSH configuration file with the following content:
Host bitbucket.org
     HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
     IdentitiesOnly yes

The default location of this file is under ~/.ssh/config, maybe you already have one. Once you add this configuration value you can use any git command without restrictions.
I hope this will help you to still SSHing the world 🗺️</span>

You might have used less before. But did you know you could use it like tail --follow? less +F logfile will stream any new lines added to your log file! You can also filter the stream with &amp; or pause it with Ctrl+C

If you&#x27;re tired of having to run your test suite manually any time you update a file, try this: git ls-files | entr -c . It will run your command every time you update a file in your project.

                    <span>When building a modern JavaScript app, you will likely rely on many other packages and third-party dependencies. For example, you might use react and react-dom for your UI, lodash for utility helper methods, webpack or rollup as your bundler, and jest with @testing-library/react for unit tests.
All of these packages are stored as dependencies in your package.json file. Understanding whether to include them as dependencies, devDependencies, or peerDependencies can sometimes be a struggle for newer developers.
In this article we&#x27;ll look at the three types of dependencies found in the package.json file and what each does.
dependencies are packages used in your app&#x27;s production bundle. If you&#x27;re building a React app, then react and react-dom would be dependencies. If you&#x27;re using react-router …</span>

Nodejs is now one of the most popular tool for backend purpose. This is so especially because of how easy it is to understand the language. It is built on JavaScript.
However, it doesn&#x27;t have so much frameworks out there that gives you all the basics (boring) stuff off the box. Basics includes things like setting up server, folder structure, authentication, mailers and so on.
Just incase you are new to Nodejs, I have a few courses you might want to checkout:

                    <span>How we define our types in Typescript impacts how effective typescript is at warning us when we make mistakes. If we take a broad approach i.e. to cover many types in a single type, we end up handicapping typescript and it becomes less effective. 
The more specific we are, the more effective typescript can be at catching possible errors. In this article, we are going to look at how we can use discriminative unions to write better and more specific types and help typescript to be more helpful to us.
Let&#x27;s take the simplest example I can think of - Shapes. In shapes, we can have Circles, Rectangles, Squares, etc; you get the idea. There is no way you can have a single type alias that can cover all shapes without compromising on something.

throughput % &#x3D; (count of deployments by environment * count of all deployments) * 100
I&#x27;ve parsed the data into a specific format for my charts in the frontend. Check out my repo here.
Result:

                    <span>I&#x27;ve created a small Node.js project to calculate DORA Metrics, it&#x27;s ongoing so is not finished but you can find the repo here. 
References/useful links: Accelerate: State of DevOps 2021, DORA metrics explained
DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) represents 7 years of research by a team at Google to identify the most effective and efficient ways to develop and deliver software. They surveyed more than 32,000 industry professionals to find out and understand what makes a high performing team different than a low performing team. As a now industry standard, DORA&#x27;s research has identified four key metrics (depending on where you look will have slightly different names):
Measure throughput by how often an organisation successfully releases to production.
For elite performers: on demand, multiple deploys per day
Measure throughput by the amount of time it takes a commit to get into production.
For elite performers: &lt; one hour
Measure stability by how long it takes an organisation to recover from a failure in production.
For elite performers: &lt; 1 hour
Measure stability by percentage of deployments causing a failure in production. 
For elite performers: 0% - 15%

                    <span>Large companies have security teams that scrutinize every partner and vendor they use. They put the vendor through the wringer with security reviews that usually involve long and tedious spreadsheets. 
The result of those painful security reviews is generally an analysis on the relative level of risk that comes with the solution. Then the business stakeholder can choose to take the advice of security or overrule it (spending political capital in the process) to say that the benefits outweigh the risks.
The review process is painful for everyone and, frankly, despite the intentions of various startups and others, it seems to be getting worse, not better.
And we have another problem: only the biggest companies even get to evaluate the security of their vendors. The rest of us aren&#x27;t privvy t…</span>

                    <span>Let&#x27;s Not Overcomplicate It


Definition: Application-layer Encryption (ALE) is when you encrypt data before sending it to a data store. There are many variations, but at its core, that&#x27;s it.
There are three main ways in which implementations may differ:
Code vs. Service: In some implementations, the encryption/decryption truly happens inside the application, which calls encrypt() or decrypt() routines. In others, an intermediate service or proxy essentially does that for you.
Client vs. Server: Some systems are strict about only encrypting and decrypting data in the client, which brings zero-trust data systems using end-to-end encryption (E2EE). E2EE is a subset of application-layer encryption. But encryption/decryption may alternately happen on the server. For server-side application-lay…</span>

                    <span>學習緣由
在開始做 Side Project 的時候，因為我使用 create-next-app 時，
沒有用成 typescript 版，我的 mentor 幫我處理的時候，
發現現在好像需要用 ssh 才能 push 到 github 上，
然後中間過程半聽半懂的 XD，想說趁機來了解一下～

 


  
  
  SSH 是什麼？


一個協定(protocol)，為 Secure Shell 的縮寫，
 


  
  
  SSH 資料傳輸方式


在此協定下，資料傳輸的方式可以用把包裹寄給朋友來說明

今天我想寄一個很機密包裹給朋友，要確保不能被別人拿走


我先加一個鎖在自己的包裹上，再傳給朋友


傳給朋友後，他看到我的鎖後，也加了自己的鎖


我看到朋友的鎖後，將自己的鎖解除，再回傳給朋友


朋友將鎖解除後，成功拿到包裹



 
這樣一來，我們可以增加傳送過程中的安全性，
但在這之前，我們需要將兩台電腦達成 SSH 連結，
 


  
  
  如何建立 SSH 連結呢？


SSH 連結採用 Client-Server 模型
 


 



在本機利用 RSA 的加密方式，產生一組公鑰(Public Key)和私鑰(Private Key)，為一對 SSH keys


將私鑰放在 Server 上


Client 利用終端機等產生一組 ID，範例格式如下：
ssh username@my_ip_address


Server 會用公鑰加密(encrypt)，產生一組隨機的挑戰訊息 (random challenge message)回傳給 Client


Client 會用私鑰將挑戰訊息解密(decrypt)後，回傳給 Server


如果解密後的挑戰訊息回傳 Server 後相符，則 SSH 連結就成立了



 
以上就是 SSH 的介紹，如果有其他想法也請大家不吝指教～

                    <span>When starting in the world of cybersecurity/hacking, we always want to run and hack anything but it&#x27;s important to know the basics. 
The reason why you lock your house when you go out so no bad guy comes inside and steal your belongings is similar to why companies are so serious about information security, Spoiler alert: no one wants their personal belongings get stolen.
Information security means securing or protecting sensitive and important information as well as the systems that store this information from any unauthorized handling.
Information security consists of various important elements, we will first start with the CIA triad and later with the rest of elements. 
The CIA triad consists of three important elements:



1. Confidentiality(C)
2. Integrity(I)
3. Availability(A)


Now, what do they mean?
Confidentiality: Only those with authorized access will be able to access the information. Example: Encryption

Integrity: The assurance that the information/data haven&#x27;t suffered any unauthorized modification. Example: Hashing

Availability: Data always been accessible for authorized users when required. Example: Backups, clustered machines

Non-repudiation: Senders of a message can&#x27;t deny having sent a message and the receivers can&#x27;t deny having received it. Example: Digital Signatures

Authenticity: Guarantee of something being genuine. Example: Digital certificates,bio-metrics



  
  
  Why Information Security attacks happen?



Attacks occur for a variety of reasons like attackers wanting to steal sensitive information, data disclosure, ransomware and many others. 
It&#x27;s important to understand the threats that a system may face to implement required preventive measures. 
You can start learning and understanding the different hacking phases:
1. Reconnaissance(Footprinting)
2. Scanning
3. Gaining access
4. Maintaining access
5. Clearing logs

Favicon is small icon that is usually shown in browser tab text to title of the site. Some Operating System display it differently, like Android or MacOS.
The best way to get favicon that will work on every device is to use generator that will do that for you.
I personally use Real Favicon Generator I trust that It create favicon for every possible use case.
To generate favicon you just upload an image. If you want best possible favicon you can generate one for MacOS and Windows that often need different background (those are

                    <span>It feels like we&#x27;ve completely moved from callbacks to Promises and async/await in the JavaScript world. So much, that almost every library and framework provides async versions of their functions. And the logic usually goes like this: &#x27;I see async -&gt; I type await and mark my function async as well -&gt; done!&#x27;. I got so used to it, so I started to forget how to create and use my own Promises. 
But life always finds a way to remind you that old habits die hard, especially if you&#x27;re talking about browsers APIs.
So, if you&#x27;re like me and need a little reminder on how to make custom Promises, I hope you&#x27;ll find this post helpful.

And it’s well worth the effort: TypeScript has some great features that can make you a stronger Angular developer. 💪
BigInt lets you represent numbers bigger than 253. This is useful when you need to perform mathematical operations on very large integers. And you can work directly with large integer IDs and high resolution timestamps.
You can create a bigint primitive in two ways:
const n0 &#x3D; 1n;
const n1 &#x3D; new BigInt(1);

There is no interoperability between bigint and number primitives, but they can be compared.
NOTE: BigInt support is only available for the esnext target.

First, in the tsconfig.json file at the root of the project, I clean up the imports and allow JSON files to be resolved on import, as shown ...
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    ...
    &quot;allowSyntheticDefaultImports&quot;: true,

In the assets folder, I define the mock-data in the following path ...
assets/mock-data/api/

Our latest sprint (for &quot;v.1.3.0🥳&quot;) was designed to culminate in a chat functionality. That&#x27;s right - I built an entire chat function in a mobile app in 3 weeks. 😉 This wasn&#x27;t your grandma&#x27;s chat either - the full feature set included profile picture uploading, routing push notifications to the correct chat window based on sender, and creation of new channels based on various events around the app. I know, I know, most dev consultants would need teams of people to get this done...

                    <span>How we define our types in Typescript impacts how effective typescript is at warning us when we make mistakes. If we take a broad approach i.e. to cover many types in a single type, we end up handicapping typescript and it becomes less effective. 
The more specific we are, the more effective typescript can be at catching possible errors. In this article, we are going to look at how we can use discriminative unions to write better and more specific types and help typescript to be more helpful to us.
Let&#x27;s take the simplest example I can think of - Shapes. In shapes, we can have Circles, Rectangles, Squares, etc; you get the idea. There is no way you can have a single type alias that can cover all shapes without compromising on something.
If we were to define a Shape type alias for just the …</span>

                    <span>The question about which state management solution to use might be just as old as React itself (or maybe even older), and answers to it are manifold. To me, there is only one good answer, and it&#x27;s the same answer I will give to every seemingly complex question:
It depends.
— TkDodo
It depends on the type of state. It depends on update frequency. It depends on scoping.
If you know me, you know I have strong preferences on what to do with server state. So lets keep that out of the picture and look at everything that&#x27;s left:
Before hooks, there was only one way of managing client state locally: in class-based components with this.setState. The state had to be an object, and the update function accepted a partial version of it.
Hooks changed that in a fundamental way. Not only could you now al…</span>

                    <span>Hi Guys and welcome back,
These operators are useful to check if there are values in the observables or to find some specific value in them. Some of these operators are similar to some array methods, with the difference that they work with observables and not with arrays.
defaultIfEmpty
Emits a given value if the source Observable completes without emitting any next value, otherwise mirrors the source Observable.
import { EMPTY, Observer } from &quot;rxjs&quot;;
import { defaultIfEmpty } from &quot;rxjs/operators&quot;;

const observer: Observer &#x3D; {
    next: x &#x3D;&gt; console.log(&#x27;value&#x27;, x),
    error: err &#x3D;&gt; console.error(&#x27;error&#x27;, err),
    complete: () &#x3D;&gt; console.log(&#x27;complete&#x27;),

                    <span>basic syntax for cron


a typical cron job looks like this
# m h  dom mon dow   command
  * *   *   *   *   /usr/bin/sh ls

stand for wildcard
this is not a cron tutorial this is just how i use it. 
the bash script looks like
#!/bin/sh
export DISPLAY&#x3D;:0
notify-send &quot;EYES CHECK&quot; &quot;Look away for 15 seconds&quot;

without line no 2 it wont work as it sets the display for notify-send. I am using notify-send as my notification daemon. 
make sure that your display is :0 
echo $DISPLAY

first you will need to make sure cron is running you can do this  by:
systemctl status cronie

p.s. this is specific to arch based system.
once cron is running you can create/edit cron job with crontab -e
then paste the code present below into the window.
*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/sh  /home/elnovo/.noti/eyes.sh

it runs every 15 min and eyes.sh is the bash script we discussed above. save it. 
crontab -l
notify-send doesn&#x27;t work from crontab</span>

I&#x27;m just a student and I have been using windows from my childhood, but I switched  to linux about a month ago. I install ubuntu on my main PC as windows was lagging a lot. My PC is a very low end PC so I taught to give linux a try. I then installed kde plasma environment on my ubuntu. And I am so happy with it that I would never switch to windows again.
Linux has a lot of awesome features. Lemme list few of the notable ones. 
Completely Free :


Customisation :


Flexibility :


Runs better on low end hardware :



and many other features...
If you are a developer, there is a high chance you are already using linux, but if you are not, then you can give it a try. 
I haven&#x27;t tried many distros but according to me , you can try Ubuntu for basic users. Or you can try Kubuntu, it has KDE environment &amp; has a lot of customisation features while is still very user friendly. 
After all linux is used everywhere from the high end servers to your android smartphones, so why not give it a try on your desktop computer as well. 
TL;DR - Give Linux a try, especially KDE plasma environment (Kubuntu)</span>

                    <span>There are hundreds of Linux distributions out there each varying in their purpose of use and the level of expertise the user needs. 
There are tools like DitroWatch to help users narrow down their options, but, still, choosing the right one could be quite a challenge.

                    <span>I finally set up my DSLR camera as a webcam, and it’s pretty cool. I wanted to share this post because I couldn’t find good, complete resources about it and I thought it might be useful for folks out there (and because future me will probably want it). Here’s everything I learned.
Here’s what I’m working with. Your setup may be different:
Camera: Canon EOS 60D
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.10
Before we get started, this may be a non-issue for a lot of folks as it’s common for camera manufacturers to create software for this. Canon, for example, make their EOS Webcam Utility that makes it easy for Windows or OSX users. But I use Linux (cue sad trombone).
If you’re like me and a handy webcam utility is not an option, let’s continue.
Firstly, make sure your camera is supported by checking this …</span>

                    <span>During my career as a software developer, I have written RESTful APIs in different languages and used different frameworks for it like VB.net, C#, Java, ASP.NET etc. But recently I got an opportunity to create RESTful APIs using Node js.
Node.js is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome&#x27;s JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine). Node.js provides a backend web application framework called as Express. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database.
We’ll be building a RESTful CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) API with Node.js, Express and MongoDB. We’ll use Mongoose for interacting with the MongoDB instance.

Hey ya folks!
OAuth is a Open Standard Authorization protocol that provides appliactions the scopes of the user&#x27;s data without sharing their password to other applications. It also makes authentication process a lot easier both for the developer and the user. For example, you might have seen &quot;Login with Google&quot; button on some websites. When you click that button, a request is made to Google&#x27;s servers and the user&#x27;s data (without password) is returned to the client side. This response can also be used against our own API to authenticate the user.

We are gonna be creating a React App which will use Google OAuth to authenticate the user. For the simplicity of the application I&#x27;m gonna store the user&#x27;s data inside the component state.

I want to share with the community the source code of a fullstack web application that I have just developed using MERN stack demonstrating basic features of a bookstore.
I hope this would be a good resource for anyone who enjoys learning Javascript in general and MERN stack in particular.
The live demo is accessible at:

The software development process has changed a lot in last few years. Many of the modern tools &amp; frameworks has built-in support to ensure that the code is clean, maintainable and readable. But any developer can make mistakes while coding a feature on mind and that&#x27;s totally fine. We all have gone through that stage &amp; we learnt through making mistakes.

Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
GitHub is a source code and file storage service with version control using git tool. GitHub Pages is a static file hosting service using a public repository. GitHub Actions is a service to automate the software workflow.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)

To convert an angular cli app to nx follow the steps below:-
Run the automatic nx generator in you app whoch will convert the angular cli project to an nx workspace




ng add @nrwl/workspace --preserveAngularCLILayout

After that remember project should never be imported into the library. Environments, common models, common components, common services move to an entirely different lib.

First you should install uml-utilities by typing the command sudo apt install uml-utilities.
Next step create a virtual interface by typing the command sudo tunctl -t tap10, then assign an IP Address to the interface by typing the command sudo ifconfig tap10 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up.

What information can you possibly get with just one photo?

To get started you will need to extra metadata from the photo, this can be done using a tool called Exiftool. This tool needs to be downloaded but I will be using an online version of this tool called ExifMeta. After uploading the image to exifmeta, you will be presented with a list of RAW data pulled from the image&#x27;s metadata. Right off the bat, I see a few things that catch my eye. XMP-exif:GPSLatitude, XMP-exif:GPSLongitude, and XMP-tiff:Copyright. After Googling OWoodflint the first result should be a twitter user with the profile picture of a cat.

Story of how I was stumbled, by a fairly simple non-vulnerable vulnerability. 
Let&#x27;s begin with CSRF definition from OWASP: 
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated.
Successful attacks consist of a user entering a malicious site (phishing), while being authenticated to a vulnerable application, which is without CSR…</span>

Vulnerability was found by the Synopsys CyRC researchers in the Bouncy Castle java library, in OpenBSDBcrypt class - see following article for more info from their side.
As it was already written in that post, the issue was with implementation method doCheckPassword- method that checks password against a 60 character Bcrypt string. Let&#x27;s dive into that and see what was the core issue and how it was fixed.
In file core/src/main/java/org/bouncycastle/crypto/generators/OpenBSDBCrypt.java we can directly go to method doCheckPassword, where we have couple major checks: whether the Bcrypt string is really Bcrypt string, and if cost factor is from proper range. Nothing special, nothing wrong, just ifs. Relevant to our issue, line 268, states th…</span>

This post is the presentation of how to make code UNSAFE. Please, do not use these code snippets in your application, unless you fancy to have a XSS. Read that, for extra protection: https://owasp.org/www-community/xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet






In this small repo/blog will show you how to make modern, secure JS Frameworks, unsafe in nice way. Using purely these frameworks, we are going to end up with XSS. Following examples might be useful during code review or making a new version of DVWA, it’s up to you. Yes, you can find all these informations in the docs, but let&#x27;s be honest - RTFM is not for everyone.

Well, we are doomed. And to add that, we are having the CORONA-19 virus around. Some of you might be familiar with the Threat Modelling in IT security but today I would like to make a Threat Modelling for your daily activity but with corona virus as main threat.

This post should NOT be treated as real measurement for preventing virus, neither it&#x27;s a good representation of threat modelling of IT systems. This post reflects NONE medical value beside link to WHO. Treat it as mind puzzle.




For those, not familiar with Threat Modelling: it is the structured and continuous process of identifying security threats in the software. The definition is not really precise about, what kind of processes and techniques we should use,…</span>

                    <span>Today, I’ll talk about authentication and how your browser handles such a process, First of all, authentication is the act of validating that users are who they claim to be. This is the first step in any security process. There are different ways to authenticate a user, the most popular methods are using SESSION IDs and JWT each of them has its pros and cons, In this article, I’ll discuss a brief about them. so let’s dive into the article.
Imagine the login process that you are doing every day when you enter your username/mail and your password to enter a website...
The browser sends a POST request to the server containing the username and password


The server checks whether this user exists or not then compare the saved hashed password to that in the request if everything is fine:

                    <span>Hi, I hope you&#x27;re doing good. Here as an angular UI developers we would have used many frameworks and libraries for minimizing our works or some of us are new to angular UI stream we would have been searching for side navigation with a well-defined style or animation effects but most of us won&#x27;t get one. So I&#x27;m going to spend some time showing how to do that without depending on frameworks and libraries, it is quite simple. Let&#x27;s jump into creation.
First, create a new project or just create a module in your existing project. To create a module, use the below command, or whatever you use all the time it will make no difference. I&#x27;ve named it side-nav you can use your own.
ng g m side-nav --route side-nav --module app.module

                    <span>I recently switched to pipewire on my Opensuse build and I&#x27;m loving it so far. I switched over to pipewire because it fixes a lot of pulseaudio issues which I&#x27;ve faced in the past. Pipewire is really new and still in the works and its more upto date for recent hardwares and bluetooth peripherals.
I&#x27;ve made a script which has does other stuff but has an option for switching to pipewire without much hassle. Clone it and run it and enter the correct option.
git clone https://github.com/drunckj/Asus-ESS
cd Asus-ESS/
./setupscript.sh

First we need to install all the necessary files
sudo zypper install pipewire pipewire-pulseaudio pipewire-alsa

It will show and errors about conflicts you should select option 1 to fix the issue which reads de-installation.
systemctl --user enable --now pipewire.{service,socket}
systemctl --user enable --now pipewire-pulse.{service,socket}

After running the above commands, you should reboot.
pactl info

Look for server name in output. If it shows 
Server Name: PulseAudio (on PipeWire)
Sometimes pipewire doesn&#x27;t generate config files so we have to move them to the right location. This can cause the bluetooth to not work too. Follow the below steps for fixing it.
If your having errors check if the below directory exists
/etc/pipewire
~/.config/pipewire

If they don&#x27;t exist, do the following and reboot and check again by running pactl info again.
sudo cp -r /usr/share/pipewire /etc/

The above command will move the config files to their default locations.</span>

                    <span>Tagging Docker Images


Docker tags convey useful information about a specific image version/variant.
They are aliases to the ID of your image which often look like this: 8f5487c8b942
Assigning tag while building image
docker build -t demo:v1 .


Assigning tag if no tag default
Lets build a image without tag.
docker build .


Now lets assign tag to the existing image without tag.
docker tag adc07a47930e demo:v2


tag for existing tag of the image
This will create another image with the same IMAGE ID.
docker tag demo:v2 demo2:v3


Whenever you make changes inside the container, it can be useful to commit a container’s file changes or settings into a new image.
By default, the container being committed and its processes will be paused while the image is committed.
