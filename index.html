With our Declarative Sync feature, we allow developers to set primary key values from their configuration files. Thus, we needed to lengthen the maximum number of characters allowed on primary keys in our database.
Seems simple, right?
I thought so, too. We're using Sequelize as our ORM tool, and I found a handy changeColumn method.

It's been a year since we introduced react-colorful, the fastest and smallest color picker component for React and Preact apps. Developers love how fast it works and how small its bundle is, so the package has become quite popular (about 1 million downloads weekly).
During the maintenance of react-colorful, we examined the color processing and discovered that all popular color manipulation libraries (such as color and tinycolor2) are quite heavy and slow. For instance, importing all 14 component…</span>

If you're coming from Frontend Web, iOS, or Android app development your knowledge of backend development might only be limited on how to query an API endpoint and magically receive the exact data you need. If you're exclusively a client (web, iOS, Android) developer then you might find that you don't really need to fully understand how the backend is implemented but it might help you to understand at a high level what happens when you dispatch a request to a backend API. That's the purpose o…</span>

Using a monolith, you have a single code base.
It is usually quite easy to share code between the different parts of the monolith, just import from the relevant file.

I recently bought some Dogecoins as I have seen the rise of Cryptocurrencies and I wanted to be a part of it.
So there I was, a novice in the matter checking my phone every five minutes to see how Dogecoin was doing. I'm sure anyone who bought Cryptocurrencies has faced this, and if you have, you know it is very exhausting.
So I wanted an easier way to know if I should buy more or sell the coins I have withouth having to rely on checking the phone 24/7.

                      <span>The Story


It's been a year since we introduced react-colorful, the fastest and smallest color picker component for React and Preact apps. Developers love how fast it works and how small its bundle is, so the package has become quite popular (about 1 million downloads weekly).
During the maintenance of react-colorful, we examined the color processing and discovered that all popular color manipulation libraries (such as color and tinycolor2) are quite heavy and slow. For instance, importing all 14 component…</span>

TypeScript is a popular JavaScript superset created by Microsoft that brings a type system on top of all the flexibility and dynamic programming capabilities of JavaScript.
The language has been built as an open-source project, licensed under the Apache License 2.0, has a very active and vibrant community, and has taken off significantly since its original inception.

XState는 FSM(Finite State Machine)과 Statecharts를 생성, 해석, 실행하기 위한 라이브러리이며, 해당 machine의 호출을 actor로 관리하기 위한 라이브러리이다.
알아야할 개념은 FSM, Statecharts, Actor model들에 대한 내용인데 이 곳에 읽어볼만한 레퍼런스들이 있다. 과거 대학교에서 이산 수학 강의를 들었을 때 마지막 챕터였던 FSM에 대해서 수학의 정수라고 말씀주셨던 기억이 난다.
위키의 내용을 보자면 유한한 개수의 상태를 가질 수 있는 오토마타로서, 오직 하나의 상태(State)만을 가지게 되고 어떠한 사건(Event)에 의해 한 상태에서 다른 상태로 변환 할 수 있는 전이(Transition)라고 하는데, 상태와 전이의 집합을 FSM으로 정의하는 것 같다.

                      <span>When working with GraphQL, one will sometimes need to assert the type of the response. Sometimes it is because of the response is a union type, sometimes because the response is a nullable result. This usually forces the developer into asserting the response type quite often which can cause a bit of noise.
To handle these assertions we will have a look at a few helpful typeguards functions: isType, isEither, isNot, isTypeInTuple.
For example, when asserting the result of the following mutation response, the…</span>

According to the 2020 edition of the IBM/Ponemon Institute Cost of a Data Breach Report, 80% of businesses polled report that customer personally identifiable information (PII) was compromised. At an average cost of $150 per record, this is the most costly data type in the report.  But all data breaches are expensive, both in terms of lost data and in the hit to an organization’s brand reputation.
