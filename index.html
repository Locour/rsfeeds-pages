                    <span>Description


There is an excellent feature called Marble tests from RxJS to test asynchronous code synchronously. We could easily use it in Angular unit tests. I have made a few basic examples about testing code by Marble tests in Angular.
My project is using Angular, so I have created a new project (using Angular CLI) by typing in console:
ng new marble-tests

My demo project is quite simple, so I answered no on
I have made a simple dummy service for getting data. All of its methods return observables using of operator, which returns the stream from given arguments. The complete code is below.
import { Injectable } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;
import { Observable, of } from &#x27;rxjs&#x27;;

@Injectable({
  providedIn: &#x27;root&#x27;,

First, open the terminal and run the following command inside your project to install the ngx-toastr plugin

Next, you need to install animation package which is required to toastr plugin.
npm install @angular/animations --save

Next open angular.json and add the following style which is required for toastr.

                    <span>Zip vs Container Approach


There are two ways to use Lambda functions in AWS. One is to provide the deployable artifact in the form of a zip file. You then have a variety of runtimes you can choose from: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html.
The other approach is the Lambda container approach. IMO, the container approach to Lambda management has two main advantages over the zip approach. 
Runtime selection


With the zip approach, you have to rely on Amazon supporting the desired runtime. For example, if your code depends on Python3.10, you better hope that Amazon supports that. In a container approach however, the runtime is something you have full control over. Just make sure either your base image supports the runtime or you install the runtime as part of one of your RUN statements.
Building dependencies


Non-native packages such as pandas, lxml, etc have to be built in the target environment for the compiled binaries to work. For example, if you build pandas on Mac, then the compiled binaries will work on Mac - not on Amazon Linux 2 which is what Lambda runs on.
With containers, you no longer have to worry about building for a target OS, as you&#x27;re able to encapsulate OS details in an image. Put simply, the image you build locally will just work in Lambda. How easy is that!</span>

I keep my 200+ public notebooks on the observablehq.com platform running by actively monitoring them with a 3rd party monitoring tool uptimerobot. Here is how I got it connected, and how I did it unobtrusively without altering the original notebooks.

Broken notebooks are a big problem. I have encountered many broken notebooks on observablehq.com, and then much later, I have written many more. The thing is, I did not know my old notebooks were broken until I randomly checked! I don&#x27;t want to host broken notebooks, but I can&#x27;t be checking 200 notebooks every week, it doesn&#x27;t scale! Instead, I figured out a way to bring off-the-shelf monitoring solutions to the notebook ecosystem. The best thing is that it can be applied‚Ä¶</span>

Building a FastAPI application with Docker
FastAPI is a fast, modern, high performance, open source Python web framework used to build APIs with Python 3.6+. It is a minimalistic framework and quite new with a smaller community compared to Django and Flask but when it comes to performance, it is the fastest by far. It supports asynchronous programming, which is a plus. To learn more about fastAPI, visit their official docs here

In todays tutorial I will demonstrate how to use powerShell in Github Actions to automate Azure Service Bus SAS tokens to generate short lived usable tokens with a validity period of 10 minutes and securely store the newly generated SAS tokens inside of an Azure Key Vault ready for consumption.
We will create an Azure Service Bus and Key Vault and a single reusable github workflow to handle our SAS token requests as well as a service principal / Azure identity to fully automate everything. For the purpose of this demonstration we will also have a main workflow that is triggered manually. Our main workflow, when triggered, will first call our reusable github workflow that will generate our temporary SAS token that will only be valid for 10 minutes and store the SAS token inside o‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>As a web developer these days, we typically need to be able to switch versions of Node on the fly, for this we want to install Node Version Manager on a clean install of our machine, we don&#x27;t want to start by installin Node on it&#x27;s own as this will give us a single version of Node (whichever we decide to install)
If you install Node first and then try to install NVM, things can get complicated, so if you have already installed Node, my suggestion is to completely remove it before installing NVM.
As well, NVM is explicitly not supported when installed via homebrew - the only correct way to install it is with the install script in NVM&#x27;s Readme.
So if you have a Mac M1, these are the steps I would encourage you to try.

An API is the gateway to your application, the interface that users and other services can use to interact with it. Traditionally, building APIs has been a challenging task until recently when web frameworks like FastAPI were introduced. FastAPI is a modern, fast and high-perfomance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. Today, we are going to take a deep dive into how FastAPI works and also learn what Docker is.

Stop. I probably don&#x27;t care (I just might!). No one can tell you your name doesn&#x27;t suit you, because there are no conventions to naming people. 
Do you want to know what else doesn&#x27;t have conventions for naming? No, it&#x27;s not the dishes on expensive menus with weird french names. It&#x27;s github repositories. If you are a github user, then you might not know this. Since there are no &#x27;proper&#x27; rules for naming repositories, we just type the first thing that comes to mind, and bam!
So, how do you name a github repository properly, and why is it important? I&#x27;ll start by answering the second question.

                    <span>It‚Äôs not that unusual to need to see/check/verify the binary output of a shell command in HEX format. Clearly, I mean without picking up a HEX editor or something like that. Last time, it happened to me a few days ago when I was to inspect the content of a base64-encoded string. The tool to the rescue is (of course not limited to) xxd. üèÖ
Using xxd, to get the HEX representation for some binary content you just need to call it with no argument:
echo -n &#x27;Computer says: &quot;Hello World!&quot;&#x27; | xxd

Depending on the case it could be more insightful to also have the ASCII values column. That‚Äôs simply done by calling xxd with -C option:
echo -n &#x27;Computer says: &quot;Hello World!&quot;&#x27; | xxd -C

Which results in such a neat output:
00000000: 436f 6d70 7574 6572 2073 6179 733a 2022 Computer says: &quot;
00000010: 4865 6c6c 6f20 576f 726c 6421 22 Hello World!&quot;

Also, xxd can do things the other way. For instance, may you need to turn a HEX string into a binary content, just call xxd with -r option, like this:
echo -n &quot;0x48656c6c6f20576f726c6421&quot; | xxd -r

Which would result in:
Hello World!

There are more xxd options which you can find by checking:
xxd --help

or
man xxd

About Regular Encounters

I‚Äôve decided to record my daily encounters with professional issues on a somewhat regular basis. Not all of them are equally important/unique/intricate, but are indeed practical, real, and of course, textually minimal.</span>

                    <span>In this article, we will see Hadoop in action by configuring a single-node cluster on Ubuntu 20.04.
Before we start, it is assumed that you are:
Familiar with basic Linux commands and operation
Aware of what Hadoop is and how it works




  
  
  Initial setup


Set up a virtual machine (VM) or cloud instance (or physical machine, if you wish) with a fresh installation of Ubuntu 20.04. Ensure that the VM or cloud instance is reachable from the host (with ping or otherwise), and that the appropriate ports are open if a firewall is enabled. For the purposes of this tutorial, you may wish to disable the firewall (the default in Ubuntu 20.04) and / or enable all inbound traffic for the security group (or equivalent) associated with the cloud instance if you are using one, though note that you ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>When you use Ubuntu server or other Linux server, you need configures IP Address using CLI interactive. Now i can show you how to configures IP Address in Ubuntu and Debian. Let&#x27;s start
Ubuntu
first, you should know where is the interface when you assign an IP. Type this command on your terminal:
$ ifconfig   
or
$ ip address

after that, so we can assign an IP to interface &#x27;ens33&#x27; by type this command:
$ sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml

then type this:
network:
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      addresses: [172.16.238.20/24]
      gateway4: 172.16.238.2
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8]
  version: 2


after all, you must apply or enable the configure:
$ sudo netplan apply
$ ifconfig

2: ens33:  mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:0c:29:77:41:f0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.16.238.20/24 brd 172.16.238.255 scope global ens33
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::20c:29ff:fe77:41f0/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

Debian
Okay, after that i think you should configure too in Debian side. First thing, type this command on your Debian terminal:
$ nano /etc/network/interfaces

after that, add this command to assign an IP:
auto ens33
iface ens33 inet static
address 172.16.238.10/24
gateway 172.16.238.2
nameservers 8.8.8.8

finally, save it by type ctrl+s to save then ctrl+x to exit. Let&#x27;s apply:
$ /ete/init.d/networking restart

[ ok ] Restarting networking (via systemctl): networking.service.

then check your IP configure:
$ ip address

2: ens33:  mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:0c:29:a0:41:4e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.16.238.10/24 brd 172.16.238.255 scope global ens33
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::20c:29ff:fea0:414e/64 scope link

                    <span>You have to understand what a shell is in relation to the kernel to understand what really happens when you run a command.

The Kernel is the most fundamental part of a computer operating system. It‚Äôs a program itself and it controls all other programs on the computer. It talks to hardware and software and is highly involved in resource management.
The Shell is an application that executes programs called commands through an interactive user interface with an operating system. It is the layer of programming that understands and executes the commands a user enters. In some systems, the shell is called a command interpreter.
Use the syntax below to write a command with an argument.
command [arg1] [arg2] .. [argn]

Adding user &#x60;demo&#x27; ...
Adding new group &#x60;demo&#x27; (1004) ...
Adding new user &#x60;demo&#x27; (1004) with group &#x60;demo&#x27; ...
Creating home directory &#x60;/home/demo&#x27; ...
Copying files from &#x60;/etc/skel&#x27; ...
New password: 
Retype new password: 
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for demo
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
    Full Name []: 
    Room Number []: 
    Work Phone []: 
    Home Phone []: 
    Other []: 
Is the information correct? [Y/n] y

2.after that type:
$ sudo visudo

3.go down to the bottom, then add this to assign a new user become sudo:
demo ALL&#x3D;(ALL:ALL) ALL

4.done, now you have new user, that will able to execute sudo command without providing a sudo password.

La conexi√≥n SSH est√° cifrada de extremo a extremo adem√°s de necesitar una autenticaci√≥n para poder conectar al servidor. SSH funciona de manera similar a Telnet, pero al contrario que este, con SSH todos los datos que se env√≠an desde el cliente al servidor, y los que se reciban desde el servidor al cliente viajan cifrados para que nadie pueda interceptar la informaci√≥n dotando de una capa extra de seguridad con respecto a Telnet.

Besides small helper functions and classes it also provides useful functions to enable reactive programming.
We would like to briefly describe the changes here.
In this version, the Transformer class has been extended with useful commands:
debug, to-base64, from-base64, path-exists, nth-key, nth-last-key, first, last and optimzed default.
The commands allow access to certain properties of objects. 
The nth-key command allows access to the nth key. The object keys are sorted.

                    <span>A few seconds ago I shipped version 5.0.0 of installed-check CLI and its companion installed-check-core module, delivering a more robust, more well tested and all-round better tool.
installed-check do?


It check&#x27;s that your project&#x27;s engine.node is equal to, or a subset of, of that of your dependencies.
Replaced old @voxpelli/semver-set, a fork of another project, with a brand new rewritten from scratch 3.x version of it.
The new @voxpelli/semver-set is well tested and hardened ‚Äì all to ensure better intersection calculations of semantic versioning ranges ‚Äì essential for calculating engine.node compatibility. Eg. ^10.17.0 || &gt;&#x3D;12.0.0 and &gt;&#x3D;8.0.0 now properly calculates.
The new @voxpelli/semver-set also fixes an issue with the license of the former module. Since its a full rewrite I could pick a license myself, so it&#x27;s now under MIT.
Other news for the installed-check modules includes a swap from the non-standard VError to my pony-cause pony-fill for the now standardised Error Causes
installed-check in general now also has much more tests and have fixes for issues those tests uncovered, making for a much more robust experience going forward.
Add it to your project:
npm install -d installed-check@latest

Then add it (early) to the tests in your package.json:
&quot;scripts&quot;: {
  &quot;test&quot;: &quot;installed-check&quot;
}

A more full-featured example can be found in eg. my list-installed project.

                    <span>Hola Amigos y bienvenidos a este vs entre dos tecnolog√≠as, en esta ocasion haremos un resumen de los que hemos venido Hablando.
Como lo hemos dicho anteriormente, hablar de cada una y confrontarlas no es que queramos hacerte usar una o la otra, por el contrario, que tengas un panorama m√°s amplio sobre cada una y los proyectos que pueden realizar en cada uno para que as√≠ completes el proyecto sin problemas, cada una tiene sus bondades para un proyecto en espec√≠fico que la otra no posea y viceversa, queda a tu elecci√≥n cual usar. Solamente ten en cuenta que para el lado web, tanto a nivel de cliente como servidor NodeJS es bastante rapido lo que lo hace un gran candidato y ganador es ese ambito, mientras que en proyectos transaccionales .Net Core se lleva el premio.

                    <span>Introduction


In this post, we will look into how we can extract text from an image with AWS Textract and then generate a pdf file and upload it to S3 bucket using AWS Step functions, we are going to deploy a serverless stack with three lambda functions, one lambda will be triggering our AWS step functions state machine and other lambdas will be used to extract the text from the image, generate the pdf and then upload it to S3 bucket.
Project setup


Our project structure will look like this

We will need to set up a basic serverless project with a serverless.yml file and our lambda functions, we also need to install aws-sdk to interact with AWS services, I‚Äôll not go into details on what is serverless.yml file is or how to set up a serverless project, for that you can check out this post.‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>As a web developer these days, we typically need to be able to switch versions of Node on the fly, for this we want to install Node Version Manager on a clean install of our machine, we don&#x27;t want to start by installin Node on it&#x27;s own as this will give us a single version of Node (whichever we decide to install)
If you install Node first and then try to install NVM, things can get complicated, so if you have already installed Node, my suggestion is to completely remove it before installing NVM.
As well, NVM is explicitly not supported when installed via homebrew - the only correct way to install it is with the install script in NVM&#x27;s Readme.
So if you have a Mac M1, these are the steps I would encourage you to try.

                    <span>In my last post(Deep dive into Node.js Architecture), we learnt about the internals of Node.js and how multiple asynchronous operations work efficiently in a single-threaded environment. We also talked about how event loop works and facilitates the event-driven architecture of Node.js. I would recommend going through my previous post before reading this one.
In this article, we are going to learn more about event loop and it&#x27;s different phases along with a code example.
Before we start, you might ask why does a Node.js developer need to know about Event loop. The answer to this is:
event loop is the one that handles all the scheduling of your application code and any misconceptions regarding this can lead to poor performance and buggy code,

We will create an Azure Service Bus and Key Vault and a single reusable github workflow to handle our SAS token requests as well as a service principal / Azure identity to fully automate everything. For the purpose of this demonstration we will also have a main workflow that is triggered manually. Our main workflow, when triggered, will first call our reusable github workflow that will generate our temporary SAS token that will only be valid for 10 minutes and store the SAS token inside o‚Ä¶</span>

As the backend requirements grows with 0% test coverage, the harder it is to maintain the project or even scale due to bugs coming out from anywhere. Debugging without tests also takes so much time to have to manually open the app, login using the credentials that you remember for a particular user role, and finally following the necessary steps to replicate the bug only to read off the error message or find out if it&#x27;s working. It&#x27;s a waste of time writing functionalities without tests, you didn&#x27;t actually &quot;save&quot; time by not writing tests. 
We&#x27;re only going to cover how to setup Jest with TypeScript and a basic unit test and fairly simple mocking to a class that we want to mock a response value of a certain method.

                    <span>I only found lists polluted with dead/toy/component-library OSS projects. (or even containing AngularJS projects)
I want to find some real and alive open source projects which are using Angular. I&#x27;m sure some of us want to dive deeper and read some Angular code used in real life.
Feel free to mention projects in the comments and I will try to keep the list up to date.

                    <span>Do it
But how does Angular know how to deal with this (click) thing? 
It works because of the so called Event Biding. Basically it binds the target event name (click) to a method from the component (doSomething).
As explained in this nice article , Angular doesn&#x27;t have a list of it&#x27;s own event names, but it actually uses the names of the underlying DOM events.
So the event binding part of the Do it snippet is the equivalent of this vanilla snippet:
element.addEventListener(&#x27;click&#x27;, () &#x3D;&gt; { doSomething() });


This means the if I want to know which events I can bind to in Angular I can search them here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
What about the $event?
If the event is a DOM event, like click, mouseenter, keyup etc then the $event is the event itself. For example in the case of click, the $event is a MouseEvent.
EventEmitter) the $event is actually the emitted data.</span>

                    <span>How to deploy and angular app to GitHub pages and get it running under your own domain: username.github.io. Also you can use the GitHub API to get access to your repositories data as I did on my personal portfolio:
Live demo
Source code
Git
GitHub account
Angular CLI
Create a new public repository using your GitHub username and this form:
username.github.io

First, clone the newly created repository to a local folder:
$ git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
Navigate to the repository root folder:
$ cd username.github.io
Create a new angular project in the root directory of the repo:
$ ng new myApp --directory ./
Open angular.json file and change the buildOutput path to ‚Äúdocs‚Äù:
angular.json
‚Ä¶
&quot;architect&quot;: {
        &quot;build&quot;: {
          &quot;builder&quot;: &quot;@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser&quot;,
          &quot;options&quot;: {
            &quot;outputPath&quot;: &quot;docs&quot;,
‚Ä¶

Build the angular application in production mode:
$ ng build --prod
You can push the /docs folder only, or you can push the whole application /myApp (recommended):
$ git add .
$ git commit -m &quot;Init app&quot;
$ git push
Now navigate to your repository settings https://github.com/username/username.github.io/settings

scroll down to the GitHub pages section to change the build source to /docs. Few seconds later your site will be built and published and you should see the message ‚ÄúYour site is published at‚Ä¶‚Äù. If don‚Äôt, try refreshing the site.

Then you can view the deployments at the right side of the repository, under environments, pressing github-pages or at https://github.com/username/username.github.io/deployments

You can make changes locally, test them using $ ng serve and then build for production using $ ng build --prod and push your updated code to GitHub. The page will automatically re-build.</span>

Time passed, I finally learned what unit tests are, what this cheap rabbit represents and I would like to help you understand too.
But what are unit tests?
A unit test is basically testing the smallest testable part of a program.
Okay, but what does that mean?
If you pr the grass in a language that supports functional paradigm for example, the smallest testable part of your code should be a function. So a unit test would be the test of any function. In the case of object orientation it would be the testing of a method of your object.
Well‚Ä¶ as everything is easier to understand in practice, let&#x27;s go to the code!

The idea of leveraging tools and frameworks to create better software is not new. For example, in traditional product-centric approaches, vendors pushed developers to build services that orbited around a smart integration bus with the vain hope of making the software more robust (Oracle SOA Suite anyone?). Constrained by lots of proprietary technologies, this approach was far from ideal for developers to design and build their applications. Nowadays, with the emergence of standards-based computing utilities (Serverless) and the novel software engineering practices that evolved with them (NoOps), we can look at these internal tools from a more developer-centric point of view.
Nowadays, you no longer need to buy a product to cover ‚Ä¶</span>

GraphQL has become quite popular due to its various features fixing under/over fetching issues. It also allows for easy caching, federation, non-versioning APIs, subscriptions etc,.
For the modern Internet where data needs to be accessible on various types of applications running on various types of devices, GraphQL seems like a great way forward and also a good concept to put into your knowledge bag.
GraphQL request and responses are typically in JSON format even though the GraphQL Spec doesn&#x27;t mandate any format‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>You are logged into your system. In this case, it&#x27;s macOS. You are facing just a simple question. Are you the only one who is logged in? I would like to give you an answer to this simple question with a bit of explanation. Here in upcoming lines, there will be a bit of theory background behind it.
In case your system is healthy (understand as an official system with applied updates), you are the only physical user logged in. You can check this logged in information with a simple command you will enter into the terminal. But there is a trick in that, will explain in next lines hereunder. Open your Terminal.app you&#x27;ll find out in Finder in the section Applications and Utilities. For more informations check official Terminal User Guide.
By entering uptime command you&#x27;ll be informed in one line output about the current time, number of days your system is up, number of logged-in users etc.
uptime

If you&#x27;ll enter this very same command into the terminal in capital form as UPTIME, you&#x27;ll receive a more readable summary of the logged-in sessions by the user.
UPTIME

The same output can be given by entering w command into the terminal.
w

Do remember you will always have a minimum of 2 logged-in users. By default when you open another terminal session it will be counted as another active user logged in. In other words, if you open four-terminal sessions, you will see 4 users logged in +1 as the default logged-in user I have written about.</span>

                    <span>In this lecture, we will dicuss about a new compression/cryptography algorithm. We cover how it started and what we&#x27;ve got at the end of researches.
One month ago, We started working on a lossless compression algorithm. We took a message from an alphabets of $n$ symbols and tried to find a way to reduce the amount of bits used tohold the message. Normally each symbol in the alphabet hold 


After seraveral tries, We found an algorithm which compress the source data with a constant ratio. 
This is how the algorithm works.
The algorithm don&#x27;t work on symbol directly but use them to construct the treatement block. And it takes as input the binary form of the message regardless of the message type, pass the binary data to the treatlent block and at output we get a new binary data which size is‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Before learning about types of cyber attacks, you must know what a cyber attack is. Basically, it is an attack performed by a group or an individual to gain unauthorized access to a system with the intent to harm the victim.
In this article, we will briefly learn about some of the most common types of cyber attacks  and how to protect yourself from them.
Phishing involves sending emails that appear to be from trusted sources. The goal is to make the victim click on the link and trick them into giving their login credentials or spreading malware.
Spear phishing is carried out in the same way, except it is more focused on particular people. The attacker has to do some research on the victim before sending them the malicious link. For example, with a little research an attacker can find your ‚Ä¶</span>

For starters, there are some HTTP Response Headers you can include in your web responses, that can prevent easily preventable vulnerabilities.
This will aim to outline all of the headers recommended by the OWASP Secure Headers Project, as part of a series. Let&#x27;s begin with a couple.

As a caveat, these are by no means foolproof. However, they do provide a first layer of defense in depth for attackers.
The recommended mechanism for configuring your web application to return these headers in every response, is by configuring your web server. Since nginx is a widely used option, I will provide examples that demonstrate how to imple‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>On bergqvist.it I used styled jsx for styling my components. I preferred that to other css-in-js frameworks (like JSS) because of it actually using CSS syntax instead of JavaScript objects.

      .label { color: red; font-style: italic; }
      .article { padding: 0; }

Since it is a multi-tenancy application, each tenant has their own database containing their data accessing the same application, thus the application needs to connect to different databases.

Best Frameworks for Developing Progressive Web Applications
1. AngularJS
It is a framework built in 2010 and largely used for creating dependable and stable PWAs using the ecosystem of JavaScript. The system helps make an amazing PWA through JSON set up so that there is no need to begin from scratch. Angular‚Äôs web app development services are so much easier as it saves the hassle of handling repetitive tasks.
PWAs created using this framework also leverage the distinctive compilation method and ahead-of-time or AOT. It has a large developers community, a huge third-party extensions archive, and modular elements. The security and speed are increased with the amazing concept of the AOT compiler.

Some applications need multiple languages, but others need one language but have loads of content to re-use. In this article, I want to show you the fastest way to create a content (some call it a dictionary) Service for your Angular application.
If you need a content service with multiple languages, I highly recommend NGX-Translate. This package offers a simple API and Pipe mechanism to re-use pieces of content but also supports multiple languages.

                    <span>In this series of articles, I am sharing the lessons that I have learned from building reactive applications in Angular using NgRx state management. My introduction explained how I came to use NgRx. Going forward, I will share best practices in the form of an example application, Eternal. Here, we‚Äôll look at the way state management lets you add caching functionality to your code.

This pattern ensures that the store does not load data it already has. In other words: It adds a caching functionality.
