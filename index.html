In this tutorial, I will walk you through a complete example of creating a single page application using Angular that will connect a server-side ASP.NET Core 5 Web API to fetch data from a SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core (Code First). At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to display some useful stats related to football players.

When you want to build your own Design System on top of Angular Material (or pretty much any other 3rd party component library), you have a couple of options:
Build a custom Angular Material theme and use the components as they are described in the documentation.
Build a custom Angular Material theme and build your own component library on top of Angular Material by wrapping their components in your own components.
There are pros and cons with both approaches. That is a topic for another post so I‚Äôm not going into the details here. Long story short, we went wi‚Ä¶</span>

What is Goggle Chrome Extension ?


Google Chrome extensions are programs that can be installed into Chrome in order to change the browser&#x27;s functionality. 
This includes adding new features to Chrome or modifying the existing behavior of the program itself to make it more convenient for the user.
How can I Install Goggle Chrome Extensions?




Open the Goggle chrome webstore 


Find and select the extensions you want


Click Add to chrome


Some extensions will let you know if they need certain permissions or data. To approve, click Add extension. Important: Make sure you only app‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>I decided to write üìù a Prometheus exporter (in Golang) for Magento 2. Why? Because I wanted a better understanding of both Prometheus and Golang. Writing an exporter gives me a practical example for both.
&quot;Magento 2 Prometheus Exporter&quot; consists of two parts, the Prometheus exporter itself and a module for Magento 2 which extends upon the REST API to expose metrics where the native API of Magento 2 lacks in performance (such as determining the amount of orders).
I would love (‚ù§Ô∏è) and appreciate some feedback and constructive criticism on the exporter. Same goes for the Magento 2 module to extend the REST API but, because the personal objective for me is learning more about Prometheus and Golang, feedback on the actual exporter is of much greater value to me.

                    <span>In this guide, you will learn how to provision an AWS EKS Kubernetes cluster with Terraform. Let‚Äôs start with the basics. 
AWS EKS provides managed Kubernetes clusters as a service. You‚Äôre on AWS and want to avoid getting into the details of setting up a Kubernetes cluster from scratch? EKS is the way to go!
You‚Äôll need to have Terraform installed locally:
brew install terraform

as well as the AWS CLI:
brew install awscli

as well as kubectl:
brew install kubernetes-cli

If you‚Äôre on a different operating system, please find the respective installation instructions here:
Terraform: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli

awscli: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html

                    <span>Motivation

The usage of traditional web is still massive and we can only dream of the Web Free concept becoming reality. We already have DeBots which provide users direct connection with blockchain. Though, user experience is still pretty limited - both by functionality and visualisation. What if we combine the traditional web navigation with built-in features of DeBots by injecting DeBot into web-pages. The interaction with them can be organized through browser extensions or wallets that support the technology.
                  The goal

Provide the developers with an easy-to-use solution of injecting DeBots into traditional web-sites. Provide the users with a convenient way of communicating with blockchain using familiar tools.
The solution should use one of the 2 ways (both is the better) of embedding to any site:
iFrame from a third-party website
                 Codebase

The code of DeBrowser can be used from the submissions of previous contests or created by the participant from scratch to fit the conditions of the current contest. Browser extension with the needed modifications can be also be used from the previous contests.
                 Security

To reach the needed security level when creating and signing the transactions it‚Äôs essential to fit the following criteria:
while using an extension: the keys should be stored in the extension and not transmitted to the browser
The solution should be visually customizable to seamlessly adopt it in site of different design. The list of customizable options should include but not be limited to:
color palette

Auth0 brings you the new ASP.NET Core Authentication SDK, which improves your development experience and better integrates with Auth0 features! Let&#x27;s take a tour through the main features of the SDK to see how easy it becomes to integrate your ASP.NET applications with Auth0.
So far, you were used to relying on the standard Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect package to integrate your ASP.NET application with Auth0. That library does its job very well. However, when you move away from implementing the simple login and logout, your code starts becoming verbose until it gets messy.

                    <span>There are two perspectives (at least) in every web scraping story: one of the website being scraped and the other of the scraper itself. In this article, we‚Äôll talk about this relationship using a specific example. On one side, there‚Äôs Bax Shop, a website selling and renting musical equipment. On the other, there‚Äôs Price2Spy ‚Äì an advanced web crawler, looking to monitor prices on Bax Shop.
We‚Äôll start off by talking about how Bax Shop came to be and give you a glimpse into its roots. Then we‚Äôll focus on the period when they first launched their online store and how initially they fought bots on their website. Afterward, we‚Äôll go over other methods they employed and also cover how Price2Spy adapted to these defenses, in this back-and-forth game of price monitoring.

                    <span>I believe every developer deserves amazing collaboration tools for managing secrets. Using a secrets manager shouldn&#x27;t come at the cost of a brain aneurysm. In fact, I think a platform designed for developers of all backgrounds can bring moments of joy to your day, promote healthy security hygiene, and boost your overall developer productivity. Doppler was built from the ground up because the Universal Secrets Platform (USP) I needed simply didn&#x27;t exist. 
I am sure at this point you may be asking who are you? What is a secret - sounds mysterious? What is a USP? How does it differ from a traditional secrets manager or even a dotenv file? Lots of questions, I‚Äôll start off with a simple one - who am I.

                    <span>RippleX and the XRP Ledger Foundation (XRPLF) are excited to announce xrpl.js version 2.0.0, a JavaScript/TypeScript library for interacting with the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Formerly known as ripple-lib, the library was renamed to better represent its role in the XRPL ecosystem and overhauled to take advantage of modern JavaScript features.
JavaScript is one of the most widely-used programming languages, and as such has a massive community of active developers. Maintaining a JavaScript SDK enables these developers to seamlessly interact with the XRP Ledger, both in the browser and in Node.js. In addition, the JavaScript libraries (xrpl.js, ripple-binary-codec, ripple-keypairs, and ripple-address-codec) power many apps in the XRPL ecosystem, as well as packages from companies such as BitGo and L‚Ä¶</span>

This article will explain the implementation details of the Select all functionality in the multi-select component based on the react-select v5.1.0 package. 





  
  
  handleChange function


The primary logic of the &quot;Select all&quot; option has been implemented in this function. 
All the elements in the list are selected.
Some of the options in the menu are selected
None of the options is selected.
The first case happens under certain conditions: the current state of the Select all option is unchecked, the length of the selected elements is greater than zero, meanwhile, either the Select all option or all the options in the menu except the Select all option are selected. If these conditions are met, then all the elements in the menu are checked.

                    <span>Lets say we have the following simple function:
const even &#x3D; (a: number) &#x3D;&gt; {
  if (a % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 0) {
    return a
  }
  throw new Error(&#x60;value: ${a} is even&#x60;);
}

as you can see if the value is even we return the number else we throw an error. The normal way of handling this would be to wrap it inside a try-catch and handle the error. But when you have multiple functions this becomes tedious and error-prone.
In the fp world instead of throwing errors all over the place, we convert them to data. This in typescript would look something like this:
type Try &#x3D; Success | Failure

where Success is a container that wraps some value of type A and Failure is the alternative one that contains the error.
Let‚Äôs try to implement this structure! We will use a mix of OOP and FP, to create nicely chain‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>This is the rule of calling hooks:
Don‚Äôt call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns.
For the usage in HOC like below taken from https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk/blob/e2f79f1c156e5e82f70cd88fd2bf22dc3be8ecad/src/withLDConsumer.tsx#L43:
function withLDConsumer(options: ConsumerOptions &#x3D; { clientOnly: false }) {
  return function withLDConsumerHoc(WrappedComponent: React.ComponentType) {
    return (props: P) &#x3D;&gt; (
      
        {({ flags, ldClient }: LDContext) &#x3D;&gt; {
          if (options.clientOnly) {
            return ;
          }

          return ;
        }}
      
    );
  };
}


Can I use hooks in the returned anonymous function, like below?
function withLDConsumer(options: ConsumerOptions &#x3D; { clientOnly: false }) {
  return function withLDConsumerHoc(WrappedComponent: React.ComponentType) {
    return (props: P) &#x3D;&gt; (
      const [name, setName] &#x3D; useState(&#x27;Mary&#x27;); 
      
        {({ flags, ldClient }: LDContext) &#x3D;&gt; {
          if (options.clientOnly) {
            return ;
          }

          return ;
        }}
      
    );
  };
}

I think it is a &quot;always use Hooks at the top level of your React function&quot;, but my friend said it is a &quot;nested function&quot;. My understanding to this is that this &quot;nest&quot; should only count from the function component level.</span>

                    <span>The last two weeks, I&#x27;ve been making some new Hacktoberfest contributions but I did not write about them. Let&#x27;s fix that! In this post I will talk about my contribution to mehrzahl.
Mehrzahl is a little npm module to format parts of a template string in singular or plural. Here is the npm page and this is how it works:
import { mz } from &quot;mehrzahl&quot;
const str &#x3D; mz(3)&#x60;There {is|are} $value bird{|s} at the park.&#x60;
// str &#x3D; &quot;There are 3 birds at the park.&quot;

The issue I worked on was to add a reverse usage of the mz utility (and calling it zm) to accomplish this:
import { zm } from &quot;mehrzahl&quot;
const template &#x3D; zm&#x60;There {was|were} $value bird{|s} at the park.&#x60;
template(5) // There were 5 birds at the park.
template(1) // There was 1 bird at the park.

                    <span>One of the things no programming course explicitly teaches about is naming patterns. This happens because there is no such thing as a universal standard when it comes to naming conventions. 
Of course some languages will have some well known general guidelines, PEP-8 for Python, while other languages will have some general guidelines which are not set in stone but usually produce good practical results. 
For example, with TypeScript:
Classes, Interfaces/Types and must be in PascalCase;
Exported strings/constants should be in UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE;
Methods and functions should be in camelCase();
And so on... that&#x27;s not the point.
However, when it comes to naming conventions it may vary from project to project, and things can get messy when a developer has &quot;tunnel vision&quot;.

                    <span>Hi everyone, how are you today? Hope you all are doing well!
Today I&#x27;m going to explain how hell works and why it&#x27;s important in conditional structures in typescript. Initially the concept is relatively simple, but the implementation makes us question its real reason for use.
First, it is important to note that the use of hell is directly related to ternary conditions in the typescript. But why?

If we can infer T, G will be the result, if not, F will be the result
The purpose of inference is to test whether an inference is possible, see the example:

It turns out that when we use our custom type we will have never as an answer when trying to infer an object with no return.

Take one more example, if S cannot infer in the sentence pattern it will return never.
There is great power when using inference in conjunction with generics and conditional structures in typescript. They are very useful when in recursive conditional structures in typescript.
I tried to show you real use cases from hell and maybe you don&#x27;t get the theory at first, but if you have any questions just send me a message and I&#x27;ll be happy to answer.

Time is very important, thanks for sharing a little bit of yours with me üòä.</span>

Imagine you are working in a new application which is set to use GraphQL on client side. Most likely you will also work with GraphQL on server side. However, sometimes you need to call an old API or a third party provider API that is built is REST. That&#x27;s fine, you can reach the goal by using RestLink API from Apollo Client.
In this article I will describe how to consume REST APIs from a Typescript client project using React hooks and RestLink.
These are the REST APIS my GraphQL client will consume, just basic CRUD operations.

Writing TypeScript code feels great because you&#x27;re protected by the compiler. Every time you transpile the code, it gets checked for any and all potential mistakes you&#x27;ve made. It&#x27;s literally making you a better developer by helping you avoid simple bugs.
However, if you&#x27;re not careful enough, you can still force those mistakes and introduce bugs by incorrectly using some of the language&#x27;s features.

This one is a classic, especially for newcomers to the language, because they see it as a way of saying &quot;I have no idea what&#x27;s going to be inside this variable, so just let me use it alright?&quot;.
That happens because we think type declaration has to be done when you declare the variable and at that time, you may not know exactly the shape of the data you&#x27;ll b‚Ä¶</span>

Effects are a powerful model for handling side effects in your application. Commonly this means when you are making a HTTP request in a NgRx powered application you will use an effect to handle the communication with the service but they can do so much more than that. And frankly this is what I usually used them for until I read https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/start-using-ngrx-effects-for-this#handling-the-flow-of-a-angular-material-dialog . 
I became intrigued by the idea of offloading some component material dialog code into the effect and started viewing the life cycle as a series of events and using the effect to talk to other effects.

Building an app, especially an Angular Mobile App, will bring several advantages to your table. For instance, its profound Model-view control Architecture and extensive Dependency Injection. 
To build one of your own successful and robust Angular Mobile App, you need to get a basic idea about other angular example Apps to get ahead of this cut-throat competitive market.

                    <span>Time to set up a Linux container on top of Android OS.


This is significantly easier than I expected. Going pack to the zeroth post in this series, I am shocked at how far the community has pushed Android OS to become a desktop replacement OS.
Some of this work was undertaken by corporations. This is most clearly shown by Samsung Dex, a desktop skin of Android that is installed on most of Samsung&#x27;s latest devices. It is still Android under the hood, and it isn&#x27;t perfect either, but it provides a basic, Chromebook-Esque interface to Android. This software package is partly the reason why I chose the Samsung Galaxy S7 Tab as well.
The two apps to start developing in a Linux container on Android OS are:
Termux

                    <span>What is traditional desktop software?


It depends on who you ask. To me, it is simply:
Audio and video editing
Document processing
Password managers
Web browsers
Video games
Conference software
Development software
Some might add 3d modeling tools, content streaming tools, or maybe torrenting utilities to this list. But for my day-to-day use on a computer, I interact with these software packages the most.
For this tutorial, I won&#x27;t be covering Development software as I will get more involved in setting up and configuring these software packages on Android in a later tutorial. But I will briefly go over a few repositories that contain useful tools that I intend to use.
I also won&#x27;t be going over the specific tools that I intend to use for everything but development. Everyone has their favorite document processor or PDF reader, no point in trying to convince you otherwise.
Have the Google Play Store installed on your device.
Search for any of the keywords listed above in the Google Play Store search bar.
Profit.
And that&#x27;s it. That is the end of part 1 of this roadmap, which again was to install the &quot;vanilla&quot; software of Android. In the next tutorial, I will go over the development setup that I have done.
But if you want to jump the gun on what software I intend to use, checkout Termux on F-Droid.
Termux is the killer app that allows for desktop-class development to happen on Android OS.

                    <span>My story



  
  
  My laptop is dead for the most part.


The radio connections are dropping, the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as long as it used to, all the A/V inputs and outputs are broken, and the laptop doesn&#x27;t display out. Furthermore, the device is approaching its sixth birthday. Sure, I could sit here and debug and fix most of these issues but I just don&#x27;t have the time.
I also don&#x27;t need the power of a laptop as often anymore. I&#x27;m not gaming on it, I don&#x27;t run computationally intensive tasks on it as I have a proper desktop with some big-beefy specs to go along with it, and I never had any intention of holding onto it for this long.
I purchased a base model Samsung Galaxy S7 Tab, the additional keyboard, and a 1TB micro-sd card to try and replace my laptop. Also for Kindle readi‚Ä¶</span>

Docker is an ecosystem of services that are used to create, run and administrate containers.
In simple terms, a container is an isolated environment just for running a particular application. A container essentially contains the application along with all the dependencies and configuration files that it needs for running.
More on that later. First, let&#x27;s see why do we need docker or containerization in particular.
The era of cloud computing sprung up a challenge of managing and maintaining the application over various cloud and development environments. Regardless of the underlying platform the application should remain stable and operational. But because of the &#x27;unknown&#x27; associated with running the application on a foreign platform, possibility of environment-specific bu‚Ä¶</span>

Project Introduction
IBus Customize @openSUSE by Songlin Jiang (@HollowMan6)


Before GSoC 2021, the IBus theme follows the global GNOME-Shell theme in GNOME and the global GTK theme in other desktop environments, and IBus lacks customization for users in GNOME.
Main Focus
This project aims to make IBus themes separate from the current GNOME-Shell theme and GTK theme so that users can customize it with other GNOME-Shell themes and GTK themes.
Other Goals
Improve the UI usability for IBus in GNOME. That is, to add more features, including customization of orientation, animation, font, opacity. Support right-click to switch the input source or open the tray menu, scroll to switch among pages or candidates, fix candidate box and IME switch list o‚Ä¶</span>

Thanks to Volta, managing multiple versions of Node is no longer a pain.
Under the covers, all the Node version managers are doing the same thing: setting up symlinks to different versions of Node installed on your computer. The difference between them is how they manage those symlinks. If you know the correct version of Node for the project you are currently working on, you can use nvm to set it to the active version, and all is well, as long as you remember to do so. The problem here is that you need to know the correct version of Node. And if you&#x27;re switching from a project that has different Node version requirements, you have to remember to switch each time you open one of those projects. As Wes Bos would say, that&#x27;s no way to live your life. ‚Ä¶</span>

An API is an application programming interface. It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other. The developer creates the API on the server and allows the client to talk to it.

When it comes to security. There is a lot of guidance and also advice and commentary on why you should or should not use each approach. It&#x27;s hard to understand all the different options and security issues they have.
You also have different clients (mobile/web/app) and each has different security requirements for managing, storing and processing data in the form of tokens, cookies or sessions.
At the end, your app may scale and not all options can be deployed as multiple instance nodes without additional changes to the app and infrastructure.
This means that you really need to make decisions at the beginning and ask questions like: What are your customers? and What are your requirements? and What can be added to the system in the future? and How is it poss‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Would you like to get notified when someone opens your dev.to article or reads your email? Yea that will be awesome. Okay then lets see how we can do that?
Lets talk about Images they are pretty cool right? Imagers are everywhere including in Articles and Emails.
![alt text](https://yoursite.com/some_image)

Or in HTML you&#x27;d use the image tag


and of course the markdown above is later compiled to HTML So lets focus on that.
So when a webpage have an image the browser will send an http request to the URL which is in the src of the image(https://yoursite.com/some_image in our case).
https://yoursite.com will send us and image which will be later shown to us in browser.
https://yoursite.com/ could look something like this
app.get(&quot;/some_image&quot;, (req, res) &#x3D;&gt; {
     res.sendFile(&#x27;some_image.jpg&#x27;)
})

But the question is, is it that all we can do? Well its our code we can do whatever we want. So why not just notify our self that someone viewed this image?
app.get(&quot;/some_image&quot;, (req, res) &#x3D;&gt; {
     notifyUser() //You can implement it the way you want
     res.sendFile(&#x27;some_image.jpg&#x27;)
})

Now we will be notified whenever a user sees our image. That also means that if we use this image in our article/email we will know when a user opens it/reads it.
So if you&#x27;re seeing this image that means ...</span>

Encryption is a common method to protect data in the cyber world, which converts plain text into a long ciphertext constructed with random alphanumeric characters.
We are using AES Advanced Encryption Standard with 256 bits key length. The following image shows how symmetric key encryption works:

class secureToke
{
    private static $secretKey &#x3D; &#x27;Your Desired key(Alphanumeric)&#x27;;
    private static $secretIv &#x3D; &#x27;www.domain.com&#x27;;
    private static $encryptMethod &#x3D; &quot;AES-256-CBC&quot;;
    public static function tokenencrypt($data)
    {
        $key &#x3D; hash(&#x27;sha256&#x27;, self::$secretKey);
        $iv &#x3D; substr(hash(&#x27;sha256&#x27;, self::$secretIv), 0, 16);
        $result &#x3D; openssl_encrypt($data, self::$encryptMethod, $key, 0, $iv);
        return $result &#x3D; base64_encode($result);
    }
    public static function tokendecrypt($data)
    {
        $key &#x3D; hash(&#x27;sha256&#x27;, self::$secretKey);
        $iv &#x3D; substr(hash(&#x27;sha256&#x27;, self::$secretIv), 0, 16);
        $result &#x3D; openssl_decrypt(base64_decode($data), self::$encryptMethod, $key, 0, $iv);
        return $result;
    }
}

Encryption method:
$tokenencrypt &#x3D; secureToken::tokenencrypt($token);

Decryption method:
$tokendecrypt &#x3D; secureToken::tokendecrypt($encryptedtoken);

Voila! it‚Äôs done‚Ä¶ Now you can encrypt your entire data on the webspace and make them secure. üôÇ</span>

                    <span>RxJS 7 has shipped! For us Angular developers, it unfortunately did not ship in time for Angular 12.
I&#x27;ve summarized key takeaways from Ben Lesh‚Äôs talk from RxJS Live Asia and his slides below. Lesh is a member of the RxJS core team and formerly worked at Google on the Angular team.
Lesh said while RxJS 7 was ‚Äúa bit faster,‚Äù the big improvement for the new version is its bundle size. RxJS 7 is 53% the size of RxJS 6. If your app used every operator in version 6, that would require 52 KB, but the same thing in RxJS 7 requires just 19 KB.
‚ÄúThis was done via a refactor, a hundred-point improvement of going around and individually moving around code, keeping the same tests, keeping the same code, and moving things around slowly but surely until we got to a place where we could see daylight and‚Ä¶</span>

Having worked with BroadcastChannel in the past (see HERE), I set about creating a service to handle this functionality.
First, I needed an interface ...
export interface BroadcastMessage {

                    <span>When selling your computer or returning it to your employer, then you should make sure to securely erase the data of your hard drive to prevent unauthorized access to it.
Simply deleting your sensitive files via the system menu is often not sufficient as professional data recovery tools may be able to restore them. In order to guarantee irrevocable deletion, it is recommended to erase the entire contents of your disk and overwrite it several times with random data. 
There are several data erasure standards, like the DoD 5220.22-M from the American Department of Defense, that define how data is securely deleted. In this article, I am showing you how to nuke all of your data according to such a standard.
The variety of hard drive erasing tools makes it difficult to make a choice.

I&#x27;m new to Angular. I came across the code with three variants. I want to know what difference does these three makes implementing in the Reactive forms(Form group, Form builder, and Form control).
Is there any priority based on the application performance of one over the other way of doing‚Ä¶

                    <span>The article is originally published to my blog: Angular and RxJS Infinite Scroll
Infinite Scroll is the ability to scroll through a large infinite list without compromising the performance of application. It improves user experience of the application. In this article I will cover how to implement infinite scroll with API in Angular 12 with the help of RxJS Operators.
A question comes in mind that how it works internally. It works like there is a big list say 10k items are there. Displaying all those items in once is not possible as it will break the application. And you can not put numbering pagination as that will look bad on the place or you have dropdown (dropdowns can not number paginations).
In that case you need infinite scroll. It loads only 10 (size is provided in configuration) r‚Ä¶</span>
