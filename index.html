                    <span>In the past I had explained how to use redis as an external source to store and access cached data. If you are interested, read this article.
However, not all solutions require the use of an external source. In case you have no idea how big the application will reach in the early days, using an internal cache can save you a lot of deployment time.
But you have to pay attention to one thing, if your application grows fast or if you already have a good number of daily requests, I always recommend using an external source. This is because by storing data in your application&#x27;s cache, you will increase your application&#x27;s memory leaks.
I know a lot of people who don&#x27;t care about memory leaks, however, if your application consumes a lot of RAM, the system may interrupt the application&#x27;s execution…</span>

                    <span>Angular is a powerful feature-rich platform that you can use to create all kinds of single-page apps, ranging from simple sites to more intricate ones. With it, you can build efficient native, web, and mobile apps with a wide range of tools and libraries it integrates. However, there are still ways apps built with it can be improved. For example, using Angular Universal, you can render your apps server-side to speed up page loads and improve SEO and performance.
Server-side rendering involves converting an app to HTML on a server. When you send a request for a particular path to the server, it returns an entirely static HTML page as a response. No additional requests need to be made to populate the page with data and resources as it is all contained in the response. The page appears almost…</span>

Grayscale release, also known as canary release.
The term &quot;canary&quot; stems from the tradition of coal miners bringing caged canaries into mines. Miners use canaries to detect the concentration of carbon monoxide in the mine. The canaries would be poisoned by high concentration of carbon monoxide, in this case miners should evacute immediately. - DevOps Practice Guide
When we use &quot;grayscale&quot; or &quot;canary&quot; in software development. It refers to a small number of users&#x27; test before official release. So the problems can be detected earlier to prevent them from affecting most users.
Pipeline with grayscale release module is a very important tool and an efficient practice in DevOps, but I knew little about this when I was a student. After onboarding, I discovered the power of pipelines.

                    <span>Frameworks such as Angular, Vue.js, React or more recently, Blazor allow you to build highly dynamic applications based on a set of static files. Hosting these applications everywhere should be simple, but the catch is that the entry point will typically be an index.html file that holds the main application logic and connects everything together.
To work around this, you are usually forced to use a .htaccess file or special server configuration to route all of your requests to the correct destinations. This issue makes hosting frontend framework applications cumbersome in a cloud storage scenario.
However, we believe that bunny.net Edge Storage is a perfect home for these files. Not only is deployment extremely easy, but we also distribute and host these files in 5 different regions around…</span>

The main purpose of this file is to hold various metadata releted to the project and it is used to give information to npm that allows to identify the project and its dependencies.
To create a package.json file manually you need to run a command npm init which will ask you a bunch of questions that is not compulsory. Just hit enter to complete those.You can change it later.
npm init -y which will create a file named package.json with the defaults.

In this Navigation Menu, we used Angular Material components and also modify CSS classes. Here we used a menu with and ripple effects on clicks. Also, we used a responsive side Expansion Panel. To show all sub-links in expandable details views. To make a clickable toggle we used material icons and functions. These fully responsive and mobile-friendly elements.

A lightweight TypeScript library for creating particles. Dependency free (*), browser ready and compatible with React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, jQuery, Preact, Inferno
         
This library is available on the two most popular CDNs and it&#x27;s easy and ready to use, if you were using particles.js it&#x27;s even easier.
You&#x27;ll find the instructions below, with all the links you need, and don&#x27;t be scared by TypeScript, it&#x27;s just the source language.
The output files are just JavaScript. 🤩
CDNs and npm have all the sources you need in Javascript, a bundle browser ready (tsparticles.min.js) and all files splitted for import syntax.
If you are still interested some lines below there are some instructions for migrating from the old particles.js library.

For example:




function ascendingOrder(arr) {
  return arr.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  });
}
ascendingOrder([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]); // This would return the value [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

                    <span>Now that you have worked and looked through the posts using higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and reduce(), you now get to apply them to solve a more complex challenge.


Complete the code for the squareList function using any combination of map(), filter(), and reduce(). The function should return a new array containing the squares of only the positive integers (decimal numbers are not integers) when an array of real numbers is passed to it. An example of an array of real numbers is [-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2].




const squareList &#x3D; arr &#x3D;&gt; {
  // Only change code below this line
  return arr;
  // Only change code above this line
};

const squaredIntegers &#x3D; squareList([-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2]);
console.log(squaredIntegers);

Hint: 
You will need to filter() the squareList for positive integers (decimals are not integers) and you will need to map()the values from your filter() function to a variable.
Answer:




const squareList &#x3D; arr &#x3D;&gt; {
  let positiveIntegersSquared &#x3D; arr.filter(num &#x3D;&gt; {
    if (Number.isInteger(num) &amp;&amp; num &gt; 0) {
      return num;
    } 
  })
    .map(num &#x3D;&gt; {
      return num * num
  });

  return positiveIntegersSquared;
};

const squaredIntegers &#x3D; squareList([-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2]);
console.log(squaredIntegers);

squareList([-3, 4.8, 5, 3, -3.2]) should return [25, 9].</span>

                    <span>Array.prototype.reduce(), or simply reduce(), is the most general of all array operations in JavaScript. You can solve almost any array processing problem using the reduce method.


The reduce method allows for more general forms of array processing, and it&#x27;s possible to show that both filter and map can be derived as special applications of reduce. The reduce method iterates over each item in an array and returns a single value (i.e. string, number, object, array). This is achieved via a callback function that is called on each iteration.


Below is an example using reduce on the users array to return the sum of all the users&#x27; ages. For simplicity, the example only uses the first and second arguments.




const users &#x3D; [
  { name: &#x27;John&#x27;, age: 34 },

                    <span>A lot of people think like programming needs a much knowledge of maths, what&#x27;s an ironic idea, yes maths are basics but to become a good developper we need to practice
We need to know basics of algorithm (variables, structures,lists, trees, etc)
2.We need to think logically.
Practice , when learning a course about programming practice is the good way to preview and see the result of each code, but when practing try to use your own variables and don&#x27;t try to copy and paste, just practice!!!


After learning basics try to go to advanced and make projects, yes real projects of course



6.After all good teacher, good programmer, try to help, teach, train others, that&#x27;s the way you will get more confortable.

Google Domain does not provide API, and the other google DNS service Cloud Domain does not support transferring a domain.

                    <span>Undoing a Commit


Similar to unstaging, we occasionally may want to undo an entire commit. To clarify, when we say &quot;undo a commit&quot;, we mean remove that commit from our history, and revert to the point at which the files were staged (with the changes captured in the commit).
git reset --soft HEAD^

To break this down, HEAD refers to the current branch, and HEAD^ means one commit back, aka the &quot;parent commit&quot;. The --soft here specifies that we should reset the branch (to point at that parent commit), but otherwise leave the files in the working directory and the index untouched.
This has the effect of undoing the commit, taking us back to just before we made it. Note that it leaves our changes staged in the index.
While useful, this is a complex command to remember, so once again we can create an alias, mapping this operation to the intuitive &quot;uncommit&quot; alias name.
git config --global alias.uncommit &#x27;reset --soft HEAD^&#x27;

Occasionally we&#x27;ll find that after making a round of changes, we realize that some of the changes are entirely unrelated to others. 
git add ., but we then realize that we only want to commit two of the three files that are now staged.
git reset filename

To remove a particular file changes from working directory
git checkout filename

To remove all the changes from working directory
git checkout .

NOTE This is one of the few dangerous operations in Git. If you run checkout without staging or committing your changes, Git will destroy your work and you will not be able to get it back. Be sure to use caution with git checkout .!</span>

When we are talking about the eCommerce sphere, software providers who work with e-retailers must be able to have access to their online store info. Such info is related to products, customers, orders, categories, taxes, etc. 
The important thing is that e-stores are based on various shopping platforms like Magento, Shopify, WooCommerce, etc. It means that access to all the valuable information from stores is possible for software solutions only if integrated with those platforms. 
As a matter of fact, your software can access online store data only with the help of API data connection with eCommerce platforms.

Grayscale release, also known as canary release.
The term &quot;canary&quot; stems from the tradition of coal miners bringing caged canaries into mines. Miners use canaries to detect the concentration of carbon monoxide in the mine. The canaries would be poisoned by high concentration of carbon monoxide, in this case miners should evacute immediately. - DevOps Practice Guide
When we use &quot;grayscale&quot; or &quot;canary&quot; in software development. It refers to a small number of users&#x27; test before official release. So the problems can be detected earlier to prevent them from affecting most users.
Pipeline with grayscale release module is a very important tool and an efficient practice in DevOps, but I knew little about this when I was a student. After onboarding, I discovered the power of pipelines.

Let’s say that your company has multiple project teams, where developers are deploying their applications to K8s. A DevOps engineer, who is managing the K8s clusters in the company, wants every project team to follow certain rules and write K8s configuration files which follow the best practices. 
This way they want to prevent any misconfigurations or security issues from ending up in the cluster when the applications are deployed.

This is for if you have troubles downloading large files while on a company network, or want to download files faster using Linux or Mac. 
1). Download aria2
Through brew: brew install aria2

Other systems: https://aria2.github.io/

Ubuntu Example:




2). cd to your downloads directory.
3). Run the following command:
aria2c --file-allocation&#x3D;none -c -x 10 -s 10 $URL

4). Replace $URL with the download URL of the file you are trying to pull.
On the corporate network, downloading the docker for mac was taking upwards of an hour. 
Downloading with aria2c:

The download was much quicker due to multi-threaded downloads! 😄
Credit to Aria2 for an awesome downloading tool!
Credit to hmj6jmh on StackOverflow for the solution they posted to &quot;How to make wget faster or multithreading?&quot; which helped me solve my frustration downloading while on corporate networks.</span>

If you are a software developer then you must be familiar with Git. Git is vastly used for version/revision control for software development for controlling source code.
It is a distributed revision control system. Git is better than SVN for speed, data integrity and also support non-linear workflows. 
Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development purpose. Yes you read it correct.
he creator of the Linux kernel designed and developed Git. Git was initially used for updating source code of the Linux kernel from around the world. 
Like any other version control systems, every Git working directory has a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities.

                    <span>In this mini-tutorial, you will learn how to write a Makefile for automating stuff from project builds to whatnot, which is executed by the make command in Linux
Cause it&#x27;s used in many many projects for building stuff cause when you have to compile thousands of files for a project and ensure that each file is older than the compiled file, then Makefile saves the day!
Imagine you have a project which has tons of files dependent on one or another and they need to be compiled at once, compiling them manually is gonna take way too much time!
Also, if you are compiling a file that is already compiled from the latest version of the source file, then you would be compiling it again (what a waste of time and resources!).
You can write a script file for automating the whole process but for ensurin…</span>

                    <span>As a web developer, you may come up with the situation of needing to set up a Virtual Machine to host your website online. While it&#x27;s great that we have a variety of managed cloud services to lift this complexity for us, it&#x27;s not a bad thing if we want to learn about some basic knowledge of setting up your own server. In fact, I come across this situation, and having this kind of knowledge is essential to me, especially when running a small project all by yourself or run with a tight budget.
Without further ado, let&#x27;s start:
This is true, especially if you don&#x27;t familiar with the Linux tools or come from a Windows background. There&#x27;s a lot of setup and maintenance hurdles that come when you start to manage your own server. And definitely, you don&#x27;t want to memorize all the things using onl…</span>

A ideia aqui é mostrar os princípios do docker de forma muito breve trazendo um pouquinho de clareza na hora de construir uma aplicação seja ela na linguagem que for.
Ao final desse tutorial, vamos conseguir fazer um CRUD sem ter &quot;nada instalado na nossa máquina&quot;, único requisito que precisamos é ter o docker instalado no computador. 
Instruções de instalação podem ser encontradas aqui

Commit to One Hour per day to learn NodeJS
Finish Udemy NodeJS Course
Build API Project using Node as the back end, React as the front and Tailwind for styling.
Document my journey, which should help me and hopefully other gain a better understanding of NodeJS.
Pretty clear and straight forward. Wish me luck.</span>

                    <span>Our goal at Knock is to empower people to move freely. A large part of achieving that goal is to make real estate transactions as easy and seamless as possible for our customers. Real estate transactions are very complicated. Calling them a &quot;big ball of mud&quot; is being gracious. If we could sum up such transactions up in one image, it would be the image of Charlie Day explaining how a person named Pepe Silvia doesn&#x27;t exist:

For us as an engineering team, this translates into a lot of complex business logic. And we want to do our best to make sure that logic is sound. If our logic is faulty it can lead to thousands of dollars of disappointment. We do not want that. Thus, we thoroughly test our code via unit testing.
We are in a growth stage at Knock so we are regularly bringing on new engineers. During this process we have learned that it can be difficult for new engineers to come to grips with our testing code base while at the same time recognizing the patterns and strategies used in our unit tests. As a result, we have started a new open repository that provides lessons for any engineer to learn from and reference. We think this repository fills a gap in the community and are thus making it available for anyone to reference and contribute to: https://github.com/knockaway/unit-test-patterns-and-strategies.
Have we missed any patterns or strategies? We welcome pull requests to add more. And if you&#x27;re looking to join a team that cares about the quality of their code, we&#x27;re hiring!</span>

Strapi is a headless CMS(Content Management System) for Nodejs to build and develop APIs, and its content super-fast and accessible in a friendly UI.
It is also self-hosted, meaning you can build your APIs in the UI, and Strapi will still host and server the API endpoints for you. With this, you can push your Strapi server to any cloud host for the world to use your APIs.
APIs are built-in Strapi in the name of collections, although they now support single-type API. For example, this collection will provide endpoints on all the HTTP verbs: POST, PUT, DELETE, GET.
For example, if we create a collections Animals. Strapi will provide us wit…</span>

The main purpose of this file is to hold various metadata releted to the project and it is used to give information to npm that allows to identify the project and its dependencies.
To create a package.json file manually you need to run a command npm init which will ask you a bunch of questions that is not compulsory. Just hit enter to complete those.You can change it later.
npm init -y which will create a file named package.json with the defaults.
Let&#x27;s see the list of available options which npm has given us to make in this file.

                    <span>For a self-thought developer like myself who basically dabbled into backend development, php was probably a more welcoming language. A great community and an easy to digest syntax. I’m pretty sure when you wrote your first program that worked on the browser you felt pretty badass. 
Going on as you advance, from an absolute beginner to a beginner (lol), you probably start to get erky with the amount of extra software to run a server. Database management and server maintenance which comes with apache pretty much helps a lot in reducing the difficulty with setting up and maintaining a database. 
So if you are a frontend developer looking to learn backend technologies, php might be a great start, but if you are conversant with JavaScript, to reduce the extra time spent learning new syntax, it might be better to stick with Nodejs. 
Nodejs is a JavaScript framework that gives you more control in managing the backend of your web based application.

  Assert


Exibe uma mensagem caso a expressão passada resulte em falha. Sua mensagem pode ser tanto uma String, Array ou Objeto.
Detalhe, caso esteja usando Node.js, os efeitos são diferentes. Caso a expressão falhe, será gerado um AssertionError.
Exibe uma lista interativa das propriedades do objeto. Muito útil para analisarmos algum elemento HTML, checar propriedades.

Com Dir teremos uma interação melhor:

Exibe dados em forma de tabela de um Objeto ou Array. muito útil para termos uma visão melhor e limpa dos dados do que apenas o console.log() nos mostra. Veja exemplo a seguir:
A iteração do Array simples temos a coluna de índice e outra com valor, ja um Array multidimensional temos mais colunas de acordo com sua dimensão, ja um Objeto temos suas Chaves e Valores bem claros a vista.
Iniciar um cronômetro com console.time() e finaliza apenas quando for chamado console.timeEnd(). Muito útil caso tenha um aparte do seu código que você deseja saber quanto tempo leva de execução. Veja exemplo a seguir:
No final da execução será exibido tempo que o Time foi aberto ate TimeEnd ser chamado.
Similar ao Log, porem Warn exibe uma mensagem de alerta e Error exibe uma mensagem de Erro. Muito útil para especificar quando e uma falha maleável e quando ocorrer um erro de fato. Veja exemplos:

Por fim, o método Clear limpa o console, se o ambiente permitir.
Vemos que nem de console.log() pode viver um desenvolvedor Javascript. Espero que este conteúdo tenha agregado mais conhecimento.</span>

You can solve the problem a great deal by getting a security tool that automates the process for you. Additionally, it helps to revops your business.
That being said, there are steps that can help you in preventing security threats to a certain extent. Today, in this post, we are going to look at the different dimensions of e-commerce security and the proven measures that enhance it.
E-commerce security is one of the most important aspects of running a successful e-commerce store. While there is a whole range of e-commerce security threats one needs to watch out for, implementing a few measures does the trick in stopping them.

Cloud computing has seen a shift from traditional Java deployments to application servers like Tomcat to highly dynamic environments such as serverless and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
Many of the benefits of these new cloud platforms rely on their ability to quickly spin application instances up to meet additional demand and restart applications to adapt to infrastructure changes like operating system upgrades or virtual machine provisioning.
Deploying Java to these environments has been a challenge, though, largely due to the amount of time it takes even a basic Java web application to start, called the cold boot time. It is not uncommon to have to wait 30 seconds or more before your application can begin serving traffic, which becomes a problem on platforms that scale down to zero waiting for incoming traffic and expect to quickly launch an application to process a request.
Quarkus is a container native platform that addresses many of these performance issues, and in this blog post, we&#x27;ll take a look at a simple Quarkus web application exposing a REST endpoint protected by Auth0.
Quarkus has been designed to address the needs of serverless and container environments by reducing startup times and memory consumption. Perhaps the most exciting thing about Quarkus is its tight integration with GraalVM to allow applications to be compiled into native binaries.
Quarkus integrates with a huge range of libraries, giving developers access to many familiar platforms and allowing for the migration of existing code bases. These libraries are selected or customized to run seamlessly on Quarkus and to be able to take advantage of native compilation.
Of course, authentication is a central requirement of any modern web application, and Quarkus has out of the box support for OAuth, which in turn can be integrated into Auth0.

Only a confirmed user is permitted into the system, ensuring that the consumer&#x27;s identity is protected.

OWASP Top Web Application Security Risks is a must-follow guide for every web developer (and mobile as well). When you hire a software development company, make sure that they are not only familiar with OWASP but also follow it.
Of course, every app development process should include a code review. Nevertheless, it is wise to use automation security as well. Ensure that the developer team who works on your software, uses tools to double-check the security of your product. One of the most popular security tools is Sonar Cube.

                    <span>In this article, I will describe some problems you can encounter mutating objects in typescript.
I have noticed that few people on StackOverflow had issues with mutations in typescript. 
Most of the time, it looks like a bug for us, but it is not.
Let&#x27;s start from type system itself.
type User &#x3D; {
    name: string;
}

Is it possible to mutate this type?
How would you change the type of name property to number?
There are several ways to do this:
type User &#x3D; {
    name: string;
}

type User1 &#x3D; User &amp; {
    name: number;
}

type User2 &#x3D; {
    [P in keyof User]: P extends &#x27;name&#x27; ? number : User[P]
}

type User3 &#x3D; Omit &amp; { name: number }

As you might have noticed, non of them mutate the type, only overrides the property.
I think this is the most natural way of dealing with object…</span>

                    <span>NestJS es un framework para backend (inicialmente) que la está empezando a romper y me atrevo a pensar que se volverá estándar poco a poco en la industria. Basado en Express, pero dándole un upgrade importante con TypeScript. Si has programado Angular en sus versiones recientes creo que te será bastante conocido.

                    <span>Code Snippets extensions are gaining popularity with VS Code developers. These extensions help developers generate common blocks of code using easy-to-recall shortcut sequences. 
The Marketplace now offers a large number of extensions that contain entire libraries of ready-to-use snippets for different languages and frameworks.
These snippets can help declare code more efficiently, with:
Fewer keystrokes,
Fewer mistakes,
Reduced physical strain, and
An overall lower cognitive load.
Some of you may already be familiar with CodeRush for Visual Studio. Our snippets are called Code Templates in this product. CodeRush Templates generate code in a similar way, but also provide significantly more power than what you would find in a typical collection of snippets.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s say you need an object with the shape of Record. You fire up your IDE and write down something like this:
type A &#x3D; { s: string };
type B &#x3D; { n: number };
type C &#x3D; { b: boolean };

type MyObject &#x3D; Record;

Great, you can now type check your object literals:
const o1: MyObject &#x3D; {
  a: { s: 1 }, // error: Type &#x27;number&#x27; is not assignable to type &#x27;string&#x27;.
};

// all good
const o2: MyObject &#x3D; {
  a: { s: &quot;str&quot; },
};

Open in TS playground →
Some time later you decide that you need to know the type of o.a, but it can&#x27;t be inferred! Due to the MyObject type reference, the object literal type information is lost and all you are left with is A | B | C:
type T &#x3D; typeof o2.a; // &#x3D;&gt; A | B | C

Open in TS playground →
Moreover, because string is used as an indexed access type of Record, TS will not warn you about the non-existent property access:
// TS guess:      &#x60;A | B | C&#x60;
// Harsh reality: &#x60;undefined&#x60;
const value &#x3D; o2.j;

Open in TS playground →
The autocomplete is also not available in this case.
Fortunately, we can leverage the power of generics to both type check the object literal and preserve type information:
type Constraint &#x3D; Record;

function identity(x: T): T {
  return x;
}

const o &#x3D; identity({
  a: { s: &quot;a&quot; },
});

type T &#x3D; typeof o.a; // &#x3D;&gt; { s: string }

Open in TS playground →
The extends clause of the type parameter enforces the correct type of the object:
const o &#x3D; identity({
  a: { s: 1 }, // error: Type &#x27;number&#x27; is not assignable to type &#x27;string&#x27;.
});

Open in TS playground →
At the same time, the literal type information is preserved because the identity function returns exactly what it have received: T, which is the (literal) type of the object literal.

                    <span>Introduction


A strictly typed schema is one of the great benefits of using Graphql. This schema acts as a contract between the backend and the frontend. When working on products that use Graphql as the backend API layer, I observed 2 types of working arrangements between team members :
Same developer owns the backend work and the front end work. In this scenario the graphql schema evolves alongside the front end code and requirements.
Multiple (2 or more) developers of same or different teams collaborate on different parts of frontend and backend
This write-up aims to address the second point where developers working on different parts of the app or feature need to do the following things:
Understand the UI needs
Understand the data needs of the UI

                    <span>Custom Angular update schematics are executed in the alphabetical order by their names declared in migrations.json.
When maintaining a custom Angular library and making breaking changes in major version, you&#x27;d like to provide your library users with a smooth migration path (nobody likes to spend much time fixing problems after upgrading npm dependencies, right?). For that purpose you can leverage scripts (aka. Angular custom schematics) that will apply code modifications to fix the breaking changes directly in user&#x27;s codebase - when running a command, i.e. ng update @my/lib@2.0.0.
All the migration scripts of schematics are declared in a json file, i.e. migrations.json. And each of them is assigned to specific version (so you can have different schematics for migration from 1.x to 2.0, and different from 2.x to 3.0).
But you might have multiple schematics targeted for the same version, i.e. 2.0.0. In case  the order of schematics matter, you need to be aware that they are executed always in the alphabetical order by the name. That&#x27;s why we should care about the prefix convention in migrations.json declared in our lib, for example numbering -01-, -02-, ...:
{
  &quot;schematics&quot;: {
    &quot;migration-v2--01-components&quot;: {
      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.0.0&quot;,
      &quot;factory&quot;: &quot;./2/component-migration#migrate&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Migrate components&quot;
    },
    &quot;migration-v2--02-services&quot;: {
      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.0.0&quot;,
      &quot;factory&quot;: &quot;./2/services-migration#migrate&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Migrate services&quot;
    },
  }
}

To proof it&#x27;s not the order of keys in the JSON that determines the order, but the alphabetical order of the keys (migration-v2--01-components, migration-v2--02-services), see the GitHub @angular/cli source code - sorting schematics by name.</span>

                    <span>We are living in a world which is covered by lots of applications and we know that these applications are still growing every single day. When the competition is so high, you need to keep your application up to date or updated to meet the requirements of the users. Your application must be fast in terms of loading and moving from different sections, if users find it slow they will surely leave your application. 
You need to develop such applications which can handle the multiple requests without sacrificing the user&#x27;s experience. Let’s understand it by implementing Angular Resolver.
What is Angular Resolver
The main aim of Angular Resolver is to  pre-fetching data when a user switches between one route to another. It will be a very smooth approach for user experience and it loads the data before the user navigates.
In our article, we also discussed the General Routing Flow v/s Angular Resolver Routing Flow, read article for more details.
We also mention why one should choose Angular Resolvers and what is Resolve Interface.
Lets understand the quick steps of Angular Resolver - How to Implement?

                    <span>Today I wanted to write about how you can integrate OpenID Connect JWT token based authentication in your application stack, Asp.net Core Web API for the back-end and Angular for the front-end. Even if you don&#x27;t use these technologies, I hope the article will give you some idea of the steps involved.
Most code I have included here comes from the github repo that I have reference at the end of the article.
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a critical piece in OpenID Connect. The client application (such as an Angular SPA), obtains a JWT access token from the authentication server using one of the pre-defined OAuth flows. It then passes the token with requests to the Resource Server (such as Asp.net Core Web API). The resource server evaluates the token and accepts/rejects the request based on it. Giv…</span>

Fail2Ban analyses server logs and identifies a pattern where a suspicious user or bot is trying to access restricted areas on the server. Brute force attacks repeatedly fail and use combinations of login credentials on after another. Fail to ban can detect failed login attempts on SSH and Apache webserver.
Installation is straight forward update apt-get and run instal fail2ban as a root user. Theses are Debian/Ubuntu commands for CentOS yum would replace apt-get and paths/locations might differ for configuration files. Check this tutorial for non-Debian operating systems.

                    <span>Learning a new skill always begins with a simple &quot;how to&quot; guide. The same holds true for learning Linux.
If you&#x27;re interested in Linux, a complete and open source operating system, you&#x27;ve likely encountered some &quot;how to&quot; guides. But learning Linux is more than just following instructions—it&#x27;s about understanding why you do what you do, and not just what to do.
As a beginner, knowing how to get started with Linux can be tricky. You may find yourself overwhelmed by the sheer number of resources out there. How do you choose? What&#x27;s going to work for you and your unique set of skills?

Of course, the first step is to get Linux on a computer. For new users, it&#x27;s not that hard—Linux is now available on everything from Chromebooks to Raspberry Pis.

                    <span>When we create Docker objects such as images, containers, volumes, etc., all these objects are stored inside a directory in our local machine. By default, all the Docker objects are stored in the following directory.
/var/lib/docker/storage-driver
Moreover, the contents stored inside the /var/lib/docker path depend on the storage driver that you are using as well. Let’s first understand the docker storage drivers in short.
Docker Storage Drivers
In an ideal case, very little amount of data gets written onto the writable layer of a Docker container. And we use volumes in Docker to write such data. But there are some workloads that require us to be able to use the container’s writable layer to write data and this is exactly where storage drivers in Docker come in.

                    <span>When it comes to exploring a Docker container’s file system, it can be in two ways - interactive and non-interactive. In short, interactive exploration of a Docker container’s file system can be done by accessing the file system through the bash of the container. While on the other hand, non-interactive exploration relates to studying the filesystem without entering the container environment either through tar files or copying the filesystem of the container.
Let’s try to discuss both these ways in this article.
Interactive Exploration of a Container File System
A container can be in two states where we can explore its file system - non-running and running. By non-running containers, we mean that the container is either not yet created or created but stopped. To explore the file systems of…</span>

                    <span>Hi all,
It&#x27;s been close to 3 years (newbie in Linux standards) since I&#x27;ve made the switch to full time desktop Linux and I just want to put it out there that I&#x27;ve been really enjoying the whole  journey and learned a lot from the community than I ever did from anywhere else. It had helped me understand more about software and  computers and also improved my workflow and speed up computing tasks in general and my love for the terminal keeps on reaching newer heights.
I believe that Linux would be very interesting for those people who likes the DIY approach and since Windows 11 doesn&#x27;t offer decent support for older hardware that can be one of the many reasons for you to change to a much more free and privacy respecting more secure and open operating system build by the people without business intentions (*not all though).
Don&#x27;t blindly switch to Linux when someone says so! It&#x27;s not for everybody and I respect that. But for any of you interested in switching to full time Linux. Do watch this: linux-for-windows-users (The guy doing the video is not from a tech background!)
Do check out my blog (some things have improved from the time of writing): reasons-i-switched-to-linux
PS: Neither am I an activist nor trying to stir up any debate here Just the user!. I do respect other people&#x27;s effort. But I prefer Linux over other operating systems that&#x27;s all.

                    <span>Vim and Terminal!?


Vim was made to work with the command line. Many beginners do not understand what are the true capabilities of Vim, myself included:) Vim can run terminal commands without leaving the text editor, open an instance of a terminal, work with shell environments, and other things depending on the use case.
You can run the shell commands from inside of Vim by just using :! before the command, : means you have to be in command mode. Just after being in command mode, the ! or bang operator will execute the command typed after it from the terminal(Linux/ macOS) or your default shell(Windows -&gt; CMD/Powershell).
:!pwd

The above command from vim will redirect to the terminal and show the output of the command and return on pressing any key. In this case, it will execute the PWD c…</span>

But there&#x27;s one thing I am stuck on, and that is search functionality. I want this functionality at api level and not on client side for obvious reasons. Can anyone help me out? I know this is not a perfect place to ask questions but I also wanted to share this with you.
Here&#x27;s the link to the hosted app. 
https://keep-clone-api.herokuapp.com/
It uses MongoDB linked to my own account. Up untill now there&#x27;s no user authentication, but I am planning on doing this later once basic functionality is completed. 
And if you need github repo of the same, please ask me. I will share that as well. Any suggestions are welcome, but main topic is that how can I implement search feature on api side. 
Thank you.</span>

                    <span>This article assumes you have a fair knowledge of the basic setup of project and connection sequelize database.
Let&#x27;s make a sequelize-app Node application and install Sequelize. First off all,create a directory for our project, enter it, and create a project with the default settings:
$ mkdir sequelize-app 
$ cd sequelize-app 

Initialize a NodeJS application by running the following command:
$ npm init -y

This will create a package.json file with a basic config. You can manually add the configuration by omitting the -y flag.
Next we&#x27;ll create the application file with a basic Express server. Let&#x27;s call it app.js to and run the following command line within the project folder.
$ npm i express

Add the following codes in the newly created app.js file

Crea un archivo package.json por defecto (manera rápida):




npm init --yes
npm init -y

Tanto npm init --yes como npm init -y hacen lo mismo.

                    <span>Warning! We&#x27;re going to see some Functional Programming concepts like pure functions, side effects etc. and obviously higher order functions.
In the last post, we saw how we can create a middleware wrapper that can wrap any function and make it an express middleware.
//withMiddleware.js

//Higher Order Function
const withMiddleware &#x3D; (func) &#x3D;&gt; {
  return (req, res, next) &#x3D;&gt; {
    func(); //func has the EXECUTION LOGIC
    next();
  }    
}

module.export &#x3D; withMiddleware;

And we can use it in this way
const withMiddleware &#x3D; require(&#x27;./withMiddleware&#x27;);

const funcOne &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
  //YOUR BUSINESS LOGIC
}

const funcTwo &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {

With massive leaps in IoT technology and a rapidly changing landscape, IoT security is a budding concern. Here&#x27;s what you need to know about IoT security.

IoT security is tough to implement. A major contributing factor is the complexity of IoT and its many factors. Instead of the back end, there&#x27;s network security and physical device security to consider as well.
The current landscape values ease of use over security. As Manuel Pais points out in DZone&#x27;s guide to IoT, there&#x27;s an onus on plug-and-play capability. This prioritizes operability and usa…</span>

TL;DR: XSS vulnerabilities remain a top threat to any HTML-based web application. In fact, 75% of web vulnerabilities in Google&#x27;s reward program are XSS vulnerabilities! Fortunately, built-in platform defenses such as Content Security Policy and Trusted Types equip us with the tools to tackle XSS. In this article, we briefly look at modern XSS vulnerabilities, followed by a detailed look at using Trusted Types policies to mitigate such vulnerabilities. In the end, we provide you with a list of concrete developer guidelines to apply Trusted Types in your projects.

                    <span>It’s impossible nowadays to build software that is 100% secure. The probability of being a victim of an attack or being exposed to a security vulnerability is proportional to the effort developers put into protecting the applications created i.e. in React Native against any attacks.
Building a mobile app is not only about creating screens, making fancy animations and processing data from the API. One of the biggest challenges in the development process is security. Also, it is one of the most often overlooked aspects when building software.
When you want to build a secure React Native app, you need to pay attention to many factors. It may require some understanding of iOS and Android native platforms and general security rules in terms of programming.

The OAuth 2 game is a fun and easy way to learn about how to use OAuth to protect the most common types of applications.
The OAuth 2 specification lists different ways of obtaining access tokens meant to leverage the different capabilities and security characteristics of distinct client (application) types. We call those different ways grants through the years. The OAuth 2 family of specifications gained new methods, called extension grants, meant to provide guidance for new types of clients.

Partial is great if you want to create an object with some of the values from a given interface. However when the object is used (via property access or through some consuming type), the object still is a Partial - as in all properties are optional, even if you have provided a value.

In these cases, what we really want is a Picked object - an object with the properties we want &quot;picked&quot; out of the original interface.
Pick is perfect, it gives us the exact strict type that we want, however (as shown) it is very verbose.

If you haven&#x27;t heard of Deno (pronounced &#x27;dee-no&#x27;), it is a JavaScript and TypeScript runtime by the creator of Node.js Ryan Dahl. 
In a nutshell Deno allows you to run JavaScript on the V8 engine much like Node.js does, but there are a few key differences:
Supports Typescript out of the box
No centralised package manager like NPM
Aims to have a browser compatible API (e.g. fetch and web workers)
Is &#x27;secure&#x27; by default, you must explicitly enable network access, file access etc.
Built in tools for code formatting, linting, test running and more...

Has a set of standardised modules reviewed by the Deno team
Ryan Dahl himself has spoken about these decisions in a number of talks. I would recommend taking a look at thi…</span>

In this article, I will write how to generate dynamic Open Graph images with Next.js and TypeScript on Vercel.
For example, the OGI of https://ogp-sample.vercel.app/hoge is like below. (Sorry that I developed this app in Japanese, but you will see the OGI has this site&#x27;s path name: &#x27;hoge&#x27;.)

If you change the path to &#x27;fuga&#x27; like https://ogp-sample.vercel.app/fuga, the OGI is like below.

You will see the OGI is automatically generated by the path name of URL.

We will do so by examining a scenario where the lack of that fix prevents an intuitive solution from working, as well as understanding why the fix in question solves the problem.

The reader doesn&#x27;t need to have more than a basic knowledge of Angular Router. Although we will make use of some advanced concepts like UrlTree, UrlSegmentGroup, they will be briefly described before being applied.

                    <span>Enumerations are an awesome feature of typescript, you can create a set of distinct cases with numeric or string-based enums.
For example, if you&#x27;re working on a game of cards and figure out you could actully use enum to define the suits:
enum Suit {
  Clubs &#x3D; &#x27;♣️&#x27;,
  Spades &#x3D; &#x27;♠️&#x27;,
  Diamonds &#x3D; &#x27;♦️&#x27;,
  Hearts &#x3D; &#x27;♥️&#x27;,
}

Now, if you have a collection of objects and each object in the collection has a value represented by an enum, you can actually write a pretty neat function to split it into smaller collections, each limited to a certain enum value. In our case we could split a deck of cards into clubs, spades, diamods and hearts correspondently.
For the sake of simplicity our deck will have only 4 cards, namely 4 aces, one from each suit, here&#x27;s our small deck:

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
