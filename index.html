                    <span>When we use Angular&#x27;s schematics to generate components, unnecessary asynchronous code is added to the test setup hook for its test suite.
The following test setup is generated by Angular&#x27;s component generation schematic:
beforeEach(async () &#x3D;&gt; {
  await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  }).compileComponents();
});

component schematic.





Alternatively, we might be using Angular&#x27;s waitForAsync test function wrapper (formerly named async) as seen in the following code snippet:
beforeEach(waitForAsync(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  }).compileComponents();
}));

waitForAsync.





Here&#x27;s the deal: It&#x27;s only necessary to call the static TestBed.compileComponents method if we&#x27;re not using the Angular CLI to run our tests (who would do such a thing, Google? üëàüòè).
The Angular CLI compiles our application and tests before the tests are run so no asynchronous action is needed for setting up the declarables.
Let&#x27;s simplify the common test setup by leaving out async-await, waitForAsync, and even the TestBed.createComponent invocation as seen in this code snippet:
beforeEach(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  });
});

The following points are true for common Angular testbed setup for tests covering all types of Angular declarables:
No need to use async-await
No need to use waitForAsync (formerly named async)
No need to call TestBed.compileComponents



Of course, there might be other reasons for introducing asynchronicity to our test setup but compiling and linking declarables is not one of them.

                    <span>In this tutorial blog post, we are going to see how to deploy .NET 6 API to AWS App Runner using AWS Copilot CLI. 
AWS App Runner is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to quickly deploy containerized web applications and APIs at scale and with no prior infrastructure experience required. Start with your source code or a container image. App Runner automatically builds and deploys the web application, and load balances traffic with encryption. App Runner also scales up or down automatically to meet your traffic needs. With App Runner, you have more time to focus on your applications rather than thinking about servers or scaling. 

The features of App Runner are
Autoscaling: starting and stopping as demand changes, between configurable min and max limits.

                    <span>Problem


As a developer, We work on different projects. Some of the projects (having oAuth or constant ports) work on only specific ports. For example, I&#x27;ve a project which always run on 8080. If any other process is using this port, I&#x27;ve to stop that process and then restart the project. 
docker containers from other projects run 
We can stop specific container by going to the specific directory and then running the following command



docker-compose down // this will shut down all the containers running in that docker environment

Additionally, to prevent a specific container from auto starting when a system is powered on (started), we can run following command
docker update --restart&#x3D;no [container id] //without square brackets</span>

                    <span>In this article I&#x27;m going to assume you have a working Node js app locally. In a terminal you type in npm start and whoosh we have a working node app locally. However how do you deploy it to the internet? 
You could use Platforms as a Service (PAAS) sites like Heroku and you can link your github repo to Heroku and deploy from there. At the time of writing that costs $7/month (roughly ¬£5/month)
But there is a more Devops pro like way which may be more customisable. 
Digital Ocean (the lowest version is $5/month or ¬£3.65 /month) which also offers a PAAS or Infrastructure as a service (IAAS).

You can pay per month to run your code on one of their private virtual servers which they call &#x27;Droplets&#x27;. Hence the digital ocean...

The Raspberry Pi 4 offers an excellent upgrade to the preceding Pi 3B+, but keeping the new model from overheating can be a challenge. Users have tried many techniques to tackle this issue, from running the Pi in the open air to utilizing cooling rigs with fans attached. But as vertical cases are gaining popularity, can my DIY vertical case keep the Broadcom BCM2711B0 quad-core A72 SOC (system on chip)‚Äîcool? Spoiler alert: Surprisingly, yes.
First of all, why subject your Raspberry Pi to this level of stress? In the case of Raspberry Pi 4, the A72 CPU is so powerful that it can overheat if it doesn&#x27;t have enough cooling. This results in the CPU being thermal throttled (governed) to reduce the power consumption and in turn reducing heat generation. The ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>A private bug bounty program I am on had a scope increase recently.
*target.com

amass does not seem to have a feature that handles this sort of search, so I generated that list in bash/zsh:
for i in $(cat mylist.txt); do 
    echo $itarget.com &gt;&gt; potential-targets; 
done

This is for only one target. If your list containing multiple targets is in targets.txt, do:
for i in $(cat targets.txt); do 
    for j in $(cat mylist.txt); do
        echo $j$i &gt;&gt; potential-targets.txt; 
    done
done

This can yield a big file. To compress it after creation:
gzip -9 potential-targets.txt

To zip them during creation:
for i in $(cat targets.txt); do 
    for j in $(cat mylist.txt); do
        echo $j$i | gzip -9 &gt;&gt; potential-targets.txt.gz; 
    done
done

Once you&#x27;ve created the list of targets and zipped them, lets say we want to find all of the potentials yielding actual pages with content. Fire up httpx:
zcat potential-targets.txt.gz | \
httpx -no-fallback -o httpx.txt

Because this can take a long time, you might consider lowering the timeout, or using more or less threads:
zcat potential-targets.txt.gz | \
httpx -no-fallback -o httpx.txt -threads 200 -timeout 1

Lets say you didn&#x27;t zip potential-targets. That&#x27;s ok. httpx has an option to read directly from file. Everyone online is so obsessed with piping output because they think it is cool, but encouraging people to merely copy/paste data results in bad thinking and approach.
httpx -l potential-targets.txt -no-fallback \
-o httpx.txt -threads 200 -timeout 1

This will run for a long time. I was running it with default timeout and 8 threads on 300,000+ possible names and it had not completed after several hours. I&#x27;m running it now on a much larger namespace and even though it is taking a long time, I am already yielding new names that did not show up in amass.

                    <span>Hello there !
Simply, I want that very ancient one to one messaging based on logged users (not bound to any SMTP servers or APIs, even If I use users oAuth and I have emails).
Whatever keywords I search with, I find sockets and real-time messaging everywhere. No one mentions internal and private users messaging nowhere. Unbelievable üò°.
You could suggest any real-time many-to-many solution and assume theoretically we can limit messaging to one-to-one, private, but no, 
The only scenario possible: A user is interested in one listing, he/she sends a message to the author of the thread, then they can chat about that in a small time window (2 days or something). This is important as I don&#x27;t want my site to be a chatting platform.
So to sum up, I&#x27;m looking for an open-source NodeJS solution even some part of a NodeJS project that I can pick. Ready made to not reinvent the wheel, and because I&#x27;m tired of this project ;(
Many thanks !!!! and no open source solutions like Slack üò°üò° you now know why üòÇ

                    <span>In this article I&#x27;m going to assume you have a working Node js app locally. In a terminal you type in npm start and whoosh we have a working node app locally. However how do you deploy it to the internet? 
You could use Platforms as a Service (PAAS) sites like Heroku and you can link your github repo to Heroku and deploy from there. At the time of writing that costs $7/month (roughly ¬£5/month)
But there is a more Devops pro like way which may be more customisable. 
Digital Ocean (the lowest version is $5/month or ¬£3.65 /month) which also offers a PAAS or Infrastructure as a service (IAAS). 
Sign up here
You can pay per month to run your code on one of their private virtual servers which they call &#x27;Droplets&#x27;. Hence the digital ocean...

In this post, I will show you how to automatically generate types for your GraphQL APIs written in Typescript using GraphQL codegen.
Some GraphQL and Typescript knowledge is expected. NodeJS and Typescript must be installed on your machine.
Typescript is a static type checker for JavaScript. It is used as a development tool and helps writing better code and catching potential errors while developing instead that on runtime.
GraphQL is a query language for writing HTTP APIs. It is very flexible and can help optiming network load as well as the amount of endpoints that you would need in a typical REST API.
Apollo GraphQL is a framework/toolset for building GraphQL APIs. It provides solutions both for server and client.

                    <span>Hi Guys Good Day!


Today, we will make a Rest API using these two technologies. You may think that this is another Rest API like all the others but in this example, we will be using a lot of TypeScript advanced features that will be really helpful for this demo. But we will be more focused on using TypeScript instead of the business logic implementation. I suggest using VSCode in this example because it provides a lot of features with TypeScript.
The API we will be making will focus on Dogs. Our endpoints will look like this.
GET /api/v1/dogs
GET /api/v1/dogs/:id
POST /api/v1/dogs
PUT /api/v1/dogs/:id
DELETE /api/v1/dogs/:id


First, make a folder, you can name it whatever you want. I will name mine express-ts-api.
  mkdir express-ts-api

After that initialize a node project.

                    <span>The¬†cron¬†command-line utility, also known as¬†cron job,¬†is a¬†job scheduler¬†on¬†a Unix-like operating system. Users who set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs¬†(commands or¬†shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.¬†It typically automates system maintenance or administration‚Äîthough its general-purpose nature makes it useful for things like downloading files from the¬†internet¬†and downloading¬†email¬†at regular intervals.
A cron job is defined by using a series of asterisks (*****) which denotes different timing as indicated below.

                    <span>The Wikipedia description of a JSON Web Token (JWT) is:
JSON Web Token is a proposed Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption 
However, this definition says a lot without really saying a lot. When I&#x27;m trying to understand a concept, I like to play around with relevant libraries. We&#x27;ll try this out with JWTs using the popular javascript library jsonwebtoken.
The first thing the docs mention is that the sign function returns a 
secret.
const jwtLibrary &#x3D; require(&#x27;jsonwebtoken&#x27;);

// The only arguments we need are a secret value and some JSON
const json &#x3D; {&quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot;, &quot;key2&quot;: &quot;value2&quot;}
const secret &#x3D; &quot;shhhhh&quot;;

                    <span>Hey everyone! I&#x27;ve recently created an Elasticsearch Typescript template so you can get started using TS &amp; Elasticsearch. 
Elasticsearch is a open-source search engine built on Apache Lucene and developed in Java. Elasticsearch allows you to store &amp; search huge volumes of data very quickly in near real-time and give back responses in milliseconds. Yes you heard that right milliseconds... It&#x27;s able to achieve these fast search speeds/responses because instead of searching the text directly, it searches through an index. It uses a structure based on documents instead of tables and schemas.
I created this template because I haven&#x27;t seen many templates for Elasticsearch &amp; Typescript and even tutorials covering this so I decided to create one to make peoples lives easier.
You can get started here!, Just follow the README on how to setup your environment variables, and setting up the server.
‚≠ês are much appreciated! :)</span>

This time, I will try searching local files and returning them for getting requests.

TypeScript ver.4.4.4
Express ver.4.17.1
ts-node ver.10.4.0
I want to get files from these directories.

I can get directory and file informations by &quot;fs.promises.readdir&quot;.

async function getFilePath(): Promise {
    const directory &#x3D; &quot;C:/Users/example/OneDrive/Documents/workspace/express-sample/sample_files&quot;;

I was looking some good issues in repos that I have starred and I found the issue Update CreateEvent to deal with repository creation. 
This is the live feed of the website and it failed to display the message whenever someone would create a new repo in the organization. 

Let&#x27;s take a look at how the front-end component deals with the REST endpoint

      if (!targetType || !target) {
        return unknown;
      }
      return {action} {targetType} {target} in;
    }

and the data returned by the api

      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Check the health/status of ACM&#x27;s various websites/deployments!&quot;,
      &quot;pusher_type&quot;: &quot;user&quot;
    },

Since ref is null when a user creates a new repo, the code returns the default message unknown. Therefore, adding a condition should fix it.
      if (!target) {
        return {action} the {targetType} ;
      }
      if (!targetType) {
        return unknown;
      }

Though the issue wasn&#x27;t hard to solve, I found it more valuable getting to know the project&#x27;s workflow. I got to learn about husky, pre-commit hooks and how to make sure code linting has no error before passing the PR tests as well as GitHub API.</span>

Continuing our series on implementing permission checking tools in React application, in this article we take a look at the function that will drive the whole process.
But first let us create a React application for our check-permissions module to reside. Do not forget to add prettier not to be messy :&lt;

Now let&#x27;s create a folder for our permission-validation module with subfolder for our check-permissions function.

That&#x27;s all the challenges done! If you missed any of the challenges they&#x27;re all available in the Playground here. Let&#x27;s talk through the final answers to day 5&#x27;s challenges.
In this challenge we were working with an existing object literal which had been as constd. The goal was to use keyof and typeof to extract interesting sets of strings from the object. The first being the keys in the object:
- type SchemeNames &#x3D; &quot;background&quot; | &quot;textColor&quot; | &quot;highlightOne&quot;
+ type SchemaNames &#x3D; keyof typeof scheme

Idealy you might have noticed the &#x27;key of&#x27; in the comment, which could have led you to keyof, from there you needed to re-use typeof to extract the type from scheme. This gets all of the keys from that constant.

In this post, I will show you how to automatically generate types for your GraphQL APIs written in Typescript using GraphQL codegen.
Some GraphQL and Typescript knowledge is expected. NodeJS and Typescript must be installed on your machine.
Typescript is a static type checker for JavaScript. It is used as a development tool and helps writing better code and catching potential errors while developing instead that on runtime.
GraphQL is a query language for writing HTTP APIs. It is very flexible and can help optiming network load as well as the amount of endpoints that you would need in a typical REST API.
Apollo GraphQL is a framework/toolset for building GraphQL APIs. It provides solutions both for server and client.

                    <span>Hi Guys Good Day!


Today, we will make a Rest API using these two technologies. You may think that this is another Rest API like all the others but in this example, we will be using a lot of TypeScript advanced features that will be really helpful for this demo. But we will be more focused on using TypeScript instead of the business logic implementation. I suggest using VSCode in this example because it provides a lot of features with TypeScript.
The API we will be making will focus on Dogs. Our endpoints will look like this.
GET /api/v1/dogs
GET /api/v1/dogs/:id
POST /api/v1/dogs
PUT /api/v1/dogs/:id
DELETE /api/v1/dogs/:id


First, make a folder, you can name it whatever you want. I will name mine express-ts-api.
  mkdir express-ts-api

After that initialize a node project.

                    <span>One of the most powerful features when creating Angular components is the Async Pipe. The greatest thing about it is that it allows you to take advantage of asynchronous rendering in your templates, but without having to worry about subscribing and unsubscribing from Observables.
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;
import { of, Subject } from &#x27;rxjs&#x27;;
import { delay, startWith, takeUntil } from &#x27;rxjs/operators&#x27;;

@Component({
  selector: &#x27;my-app&#x27;,
  template: &#x60;
    
Async example
 
    
Items
 
    
{{item}}
Other Items
 
    
{{other}}
 this.otherItems &#x3D; other)
  }
  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.destroy$.next();
    this.destroy$.complete();
  }
}


Check it out on Stackblitz.
As you can see, in the first example, we are rendering a list (items) using the async pipe in the HTML template. There is no need for the additional handling after the component is destroyed, which you can see is not the case for the other list otherItems.   That is simply because the async pipe is going to take care of that for you.</span>

1. Ivy Everywhere
In Angular 12, View Engine is deprecated, and the community is working on ongoing delivery towards the goal of amalgamating the ecosystem of Angular on Ivy. Current libraries still use View Engine. But the library authors want to shift to Ivy. AngularJS development services become easy with Ivy as developers can compile all components independently and enhances development times.
2. Adios Protractor

                    <span>As we know multiple components share the common data and always need updated shared data. In such scenarios most of the time BehaviorSubject is used which acts as a single store to hold updated shared data.
BehaviorSubject is both observer and type of observable.
BehaviorSubject always need an initial/default value.
Every observer on subscribe gets current value.
Current value is either latest value emitted by source observable using next() method or initial/default value.
Let‚Äôs implement BehaviorSubject to understand a concept better!
For e.g In order tracking app, display total items in cart and total items in wish list on UI in header and dashboard section based on user action.
Now we have three components -

Run Live
When user add items in the cart/wishList, total count needs to be updated in the header and dashboard component.
1.First create a BehaviorSubject in order service which holds the initial state of order count ,so that it can be used by any component.




3.When a user performs any action, call the next() method of source observable. When the next() method gets called it will update current count with new count and notifies updated count to all observers(3 Components) who subscribed to source observable.

This way BehaviorSubject makes components communication more effective.

In Kubernetes, a service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. The set of pods targeted by a service is usually determined by a selector. Kubernetes services provide addresses through which associated pods can be accessed.
Take a look at the service.yaml file below:
app:myapp.

  
  
  Creating a Kubernetes Service




kubectl apply -f service.yaml

The minikube tunnel command can be used to expose LoadBalancer services. To keep the LoadBalancer active, it must be run in a separate terminal window.
minikube tunnel 

minikube tunnel runs as a process on the host and creates a network route to the cluster‚Äôs service CIDR using the cluster‚Äôs IP address as a gateway. The tunnel command gives any application on the host operating system immediate access to the external IP address.
kubectl get service myapp

You should be able to see the external ip; earlier it would have been pending.
minikube service --url myapp

You should be able to view this in your browser.
Welcome to myapp!
The section about services is incomplete without an analogy from the dev life. 
It‚Äôs Been a Long Article‚Ä¶ and I Hope To Tell You More About It Next Time!
With that, we come to the end of the series on K8s made relatable and the adventures of the fresher on the first day. However there is more to be learned, and more adventures to follow, so stay tuned!

                    <span>Hi everyone!
In the previous articles, we have discussed about containers &amp; images and how to run containers on docker. We discussed about the need for Kubernetes. In this article, we will take a closer look at K8s and why it is so essential.
Kubernetes is an open source container management and deployment platform. It orchestrates virtual machine clusters and schedules containers to operate on those virtual machines depending on their available computational resources and the container‚Äôs resource needs. 
They can be related with managers, who plan and coordinate developers to deliver projects and make sure they have all the resources required to do so.
We can use K8s to deploy our services, roll out new releases without downtime, and scale (or descale) those services. It is portable, exte‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Why do you need a Pull Request Template?


Pull Request(PR) are often when raised are not properly documented. The best way to document them is to use a consistent template. The Template will help the team to document the PR in a concise way. PR reviewer gets an idea about what to expect in a PR.
Create a file pull_request_template.md inside a root folder of the repository called ./github
./github/pull_request_template.md

This file is nothing but a template that will be shown on GitHub PR, when the PR is raised.

                    <span>Welcome back to the second part of this series. 
Docker is a well-known runtime environment for creating and building applications within containers. It deploys containerized applications or software in different environments, from development to testing and production, using Docker images.
Let‚Äôs create a basic Go application that we will use to deploy on our minikube cluster.
go mod init 
go mod tidy

To create the dockerfile for our application, we will refer to this:
For building the docker image, run the following command in the terminal:
docker build --tag myapp .
docker images

You should be able to see the newly created myapp image in the list.
To publish a port for our container, we‚Äôll use the --publish flag (-p for short) on the docker run command. The format of the --publish command is [host_port]:[container_port]. So if we wanted to expose port 8080 inside the container to port 3000 outside the container, we would pass 3000:8080 to the --publish flag.
docker run -d -p 8080:10000 myapp

Open localhost:8080 in the terminal; it should say
We saw how useful containers can be for running applications in an isolated way, on any environment. However, in production, hundreds to thousands of different containers may be required.
Container runtime systems like Docker benefit from the usage of additional technologies to orchestrate or manage all of the containers in use.
This orchestration is handled by Kubernetes.
In the next part, we will explore what Kubernetes is and how it works.

                    <span>Hi Developers,
Writing a script for the application deployment can be very interesting to ensure rapid deployment without forgetting anything.
Implemented features :
Set system settings.
Set security settings.
Enable services.
Configure namespaces, databases, mapping.
Export existing configuration.
All features are exposed with a RESTful API.
This library is focused on IRIS configuration to help applications deployment. So, config-api doesn&#x27;t import\compile code feature, considering it should be the role of your application installer module or the client registry.  config-api could be used with the ZPM client to configure IRIS settings on module deployment, we learn how to combine this library with ZPM in another article.

Though e-mail exchanges remain the official mode of written communication, face-to-face meetings have been replaced by video conferences. 
Video communication proves to be more effective than audio communication as 95% of people agree that face-to-face meetings foster business relationships. 
In this article, we are going to discuss the 7 best web video conferencing software in the world for businesses.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve recently come across Gitpod. Gitpod provides cloud-based development environments. They&#x27;re similar to GitHub Codespaces, but in my opinion offer a better experience. Setting up an environment is simpler and they are all about ephemerality. The idea is that each environment just lives for the duration of the task you&#x27;re working on, and then you throw it away. Like Codespaces, Gitpod uses the Visual Studio Code editor, which you can access with your browser.
I&#x27;m slowly adding Gitpod to all of my projects, because the development experience is much better than doing it on my local machine.
For one of my Rails projects, I had some issues getting the Rubocop linter to work. Here&#x27;s a short set up guide to so that others can avoid the problem I had.

                    <span>Hi everyone. I&#x27;ve been fighting with VSCode for almost two weeks now.
VSC keeps freezing my whole system randomly while working.
FiveServer
Pretier
Aura Theme
Tabnine (free)
I&#x27;ve tried working with and without extensions, with the same result.
I&#x27;ve even tried to run VSC from console with --disable-gpu attr.
Freezing is random. Sometimes while typing, sometimes when switching windows between VSC and FF.
First thought there is a problem with FF but then it froze wit only VSC lunched :/
Does anyone had the same problem?
I really liked working with VSC.
I&#x27;ve tried Atom as a replacement, but not like it so much.
WEBSTORM is cool but it&#x27;s overkill for me for now.</span>

                    <span>Hello Folks üëã , Ankit here so now let&#x27;s have a quick look at the most used and favourite command among linux users i.e the history command.
In your shell, there is a history of the commands that you previously entered, you can actually look through these commands. This is quite useful when you want to find and run a command you used previously without actually typing it again.
$ history
Some Shortcut tricks and Wow factors of history Command
‚Üë ---&gt; we can also use the upper arrow key to run the previous commands
!! ---&gt; if you want to run the command that you used earlier without writing the whole command you can just type in this !!
Next in the list is ctrl - R 
ctrl - R ---&gt; this is the reverse search command . so how it works is simple you have to press ctrl r and then you can write some parts of the command for e.g :- you write ls and then you pressed ctrl - R again so what it will do is it will show you the matches and you can just navigate through them by pressing ctrl -r again
our terminal is getting a little cluttered so to clear up the display we can use the below command üëáüëáüëá
clear 
So now if we are talking about so much useful features of the linux without tab completion how can my article be completed üòÖüòÖ
Tab-Completion ---&gt; So how it works is if you type chr or firef and then press tab it will autocomplete the command like if u typed chr it will autocomplete the command with chrome 

So that was all from my side . Have a great day ahead  ‚úå‚úå</span>

                    <span>Pada artikel kali ini Ruang Koding akan membahas tentang bagaimana cara generate SSH Key di Ubuntu 20.04 untuk dapat mengakses server secara remote. Hal ini dilakukan agar kita dapat mengakses server tanpa harus menggunakan password. Tentunya dengan menggunakan SSH Key, server kita akan jauh lebih aman.
SSH adalah singkatan dari Secure Shell Protocol yaitu merupakan protokol jaringan kriptografi yang memungkinkan pengguna untuk mengakses komputer jarak jauh dengan aman melalui jaringan internet.
Meskipun SSH mendukung otentikasi berbasis kata sandi, umumnya kamu disarankan untuk menggunakan SSH key. SSH key adalah metode yang lebih aman untuk login ke server Linux, karena tidak rentan terhadap serangan peretasan kata sandi brute-force.

There&#x27;s a lot of information out there about adding authentication to your app, which is helpful! But also overwhelming. It can be hard to find relevant and up-to-date information. Security best practices and technologies change, so refreshing your understanding and keeping up with current best practices is a good thing. Here are some notes I took while I reviewed my knowledge and applied my experience implementing auth.

If you&#x27;re implementing authentication to a new application, the best practice is to use OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect (OIDC). The combination of OAuth 2.0 with OIDC provides consistency across many integration providers, standardi‚Ä¶</span>

Hello, and welcome!
It&#x27;s another Friday. Let&#x27;s get down to business.
Most of the news that we&#x27;ll review this week is about vulnerabilities and bugs.
Popular NPM Package Hijacked to Publish Crypto-mining Malware


As a developer, reading articles like this makes me think twice before downloading a package from NPM, but sometimes, you might need that package so bad, you&#x27;ll forget about &quot;security&quot;.
Excerpt from the article:
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Friday warned of crypto-mining and password-stealing malware embedded in &quot;UAParser.js,&quot; a popular JavaScript NPM library with over 6 million weekly downloads, days after the NPM repository moved to get rid of three rogue packages that were found to mimic the same library

                    <span>Many people are concerned about how much personal information is stored on the internet and could be stolen or misused in today&#x27;s reality. You&#x27;re not the only one who feels this way. The issue of online privacy is crucial.
You can improve your online security against unwanted access to your data and privacy by taking several simple actions.
1 
Browse in private mode or use a browser, which doesn&#x27;t store and send your data.
Browsing in private mode can let you avoid your browser&#x27;s history from tracing. However, these private modes aren&#x27;t entirely private. Your ISP can observe your surfing behavior even if you&#x27;re using an incognito or private mode.
e.g.
https://www.brave.com/
https://www.beakerbrowser.com/
2 
Be cautious about where you click.
Phishing attempts are one of the ways how hackers can compromise your online privacy. They frequently accomplish this by sending fake emails that look like from banks, credit card companies, etc. 
3 
Change your search engine.
If you&#x27;re like most web users, you use Google as your primary search engine.
e.g.
https://www.duckduckgo.com/
https://www.startpage.com/
4
Use dedicated proxy servers. 
A dedicated proxy server acts as a private and secure connection point between users and the internet. It&#x27;s a server that acts as an &quot;intermediary&quot; between end-users and the web pages they browse on the internet. An IP address is used when a computer connects to the internet.
You can compare it to your home&#x27;s street address. It directs data to the appropriate destination while also providing a return address for other devices.
A dedicated proxy server is a machine connected to the internet that has its unique IP address and serves as a disguise for your computer.
There are plenty of companies that provide such services, here is my personal top of the most reliable ones:

From Key Vault access policy, assign certificate get permission (or any other additional required permissions) for the managed id.
From WebApp configurations menu, add WEBSITE_LOAD_USER_PROFILE application setting and set value to 1.</span>

Welcome to the fifth, and last, Type | Treat challenge! These challenges are a series of blog posts which have 2 code challenges in, one for beginners and one for intermediate TypeScript programmers. We&#x27;re on day five, which means going over the answers from yesterday and have 2 new challenges.
This challenge aimed to be generics 101, first introducing the concept of making your function pass a type from the function to the argument:
-  function getBowl(items: any) {
+  function getBowl(items: T) {
      return { items }
  }

The any acted as hint clue about where to look, and this example is almost the first code sample on the Generics chapter in the Handbook, so it felt like a good intro.
The second part involved understanding generic constraints, these are ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Introduction


In this blog, we are going to look at, How to set up Storybooks with React and my all-time favourite language(TypeScript). 
Storybook is a UI development tool that lets you preview your components in a very rich library design that will help you to change all props for the component and test out your component in different scenarios. 
Maybe you should only use storybook if you&#x27;re creating a component library(Open Source or for organisation). As for me, I created a component library for my organisation which is supposed to be used across multiple react projects. There I implemented Storybook(in component library project) so that everyone can have a preview of all components provided by the internal-component-library and use it according to the (kind of) storybook generated docs based on props.
Make sure you have installed or created a new react project with
npx create-react-app storybook-ts-blog

Now storybook can handle the setup part, just run the below command.
npx sb init

It will install storybook and add the necessary files for you to work with storybook.
Run storybook using below command
npm run storybook

Maybe you should also host the component library even if it&#x27;s an internal project as it will help anyone other than devs(designers, managers) to have a look at your messü§™(just kidding, I mean your components), just add basic authentication(username+password) before showing the hosted website.
To generate HTML files to host, run the below command
npm run build-storybook -- -o ./path/to/build

To run the build locally, use this command
npx http-server ./path/to/build</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a little side project and I just wanted to share it with you so that maybe you can find some use for it in your own projects. 
typed is similar to superstruct and zod in that it validates data at runtime and it is type-safe but what&#x27;s different about it is that it comes in a tiny package (1kb) with an ESM build and it also outperforms them by a significant amount.
Here is where my original post would have ended, but somebody mention in the comments that I should tease you with some examples (yes, my marketing skills suck!).
So before I show some examples let me explain why I made it in the first place. The first reason was curiosity: build it to understand how other libraries work. typed actually borrows some type definitions from superstruct because when I started wri‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Merge conflicts... Nobody likes them. Some of us even fear them. But they are a fact of life when you&#x27;re working with Git, especially when you&#x27;re teaming up with other developers. In most cases, merge conflicts aren&#x27;t as scary as you might think. In this fourth part of our ‚ÄúAdvanced Git‚Äù series we&#x27;ll talk about when they can happen, what they actually are, and how to solve them.

Understand what an alias is
Set your first alias and use it
Custom some other useful aliases
In the following, I will use the term &quot;terminal&quot; regardless of the type of shell, assuming a UNIX-like OS environment such as Mac or Linux.
As it turns out, aliases are like shortcut keys in the terminal.
command+x  to cut text and command+v to paste on Macbook, the terminal also has shortcuts.
git branch is one of the most common commands to see what branch you are on. However, typing git branch every time is a bit tedious, isn&#x27;t it? So, if you create an alias, ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>MedSec is a network and pentest utility that I developed so that I could perform different kinds of task using the same suite, instead of jumping from one tool to another.
Currently, this script can perform a good variety of tasks such as ifconfig, ping, traceroute, port scans (including SYN, TCP, UDP, ACK, comprehensive scan, host discovery (scan for up devices on a local network), MAC address detection (get MAC address of a host IP on a local network), banner grabbing, DNS checks (with geolocation information), WHOIS, subdomain enumeration, vulnerability reconnaissance, packet sniffing, MAC spoofing, IP spoofing, SYN flooding, deauth attack and brute-force attack (beta).
Other features are still being implemented. Future implementations may include WAF detection, DNS enumeration, traffic analysis, XSS vulnerability scanner, ARP cache poisoning, DNS cache poisoning, MAC flooding, ping of death, network disassociation attack (not deauth attack), OSINT, exploits, some automated tasks and others.

                    <span>Introduction


The security alarm system will use a bipolar junction transistor switch to detect security problems. Theft attempt and other security threats can be controlled by using this simple circuit.
For the purpose of this application, we will design a security system for one room in a house. The sensor used for each opening can be either a mechanical switch, a magnetically operated switch, or an optical sensor. Detection of an intrusion can be used to initiate an audible alarm signal. 
We will be using a mechanical switch as our sensor and use a transistor as a NOT gate, so that when there is an open switch in our room a transistor will show a signal that an intruder has entered.
Resistor
Transistor
Buzzer
Voltage source

Room sensor is normally in a closed position and it is connected to a DC voltage source. When a door is open it creates an open circuit.


Transistor switches are used for high power devices such as
The areas of operation for Transistor switch are known as the Saturation Region and the Cut-Off Region.
Cut-off Region: here there is a large depletion layer


Saturation Region: here the depletion layer is as




  
  
  NOT Gate Transistor


A NOT gate simply inverts its input. If the input is high, the output is low, and if the input is low, the output is high

The operation of this circuit is simple. The input is connected through resistor R2 to the transistor‚Äôs
When voltage is present at the input, the transistor turns on, allowing current to flow through the collector-emitter circuit directly to ground. This ground path creates a shortcut that bypasses the output, which causes the output to go low.
We run our simulation with a voltmeter connected to the output, in place of the buzzer .

In the normal state, the switch will be closed.

When intrusion happens, the switch will open and the alarm (buzzer) will go off.</span>

                    <span>In the ‚ÄúLeveraging Salesforce Using Spring Boot‚Äù article, I navigated the course for introducing a Spring Boot service that would leverage the well-established Salesforce RESTful API. The goal of this service was to act as a middleware layer; that way, clients not written in Salesforce could retrieve and update contact data stored in Salesforce. This backend service implemented its own caching layer to provide a faster response time and also cut down on the number of times Salesforce needed to be called.
In ‚ÄúLeveraging Salesforce Using a Client Written In Svelte,‚Äù I introduced a simple client written in Svelte, which made it possible to update the Salesforce data using an inline editor‚Äîagain, without actually using the Salesforce client.

                    <span>Today&#x27;s topic is Confirmation dialog box in Angular. It&#x27;s been a while since my last post, and this one might be pretty useful for Angular developers. In the following several passages I&#x27;ll try to answer several questions:
What is the confirmation box in Angular? 


What is the best confirmation dialog for Angular, and why? 


How to integrate it into any Angular project?


How it looks like?







  
  
  What is the confirmation box in Angular?


It is a simple popup that prevents unwanted actions, for example when the user clicks the delete button, the popup dialog should appear with the question: &quot;Are you sure you want to delete item data?&quot; and two buttons &quot;Confirm&quot; and &quot;Decline&quot;. That is an enhanced level of security needed in almost every professional application. 
It is the ngx-awesome-popup an open-source library made for Angular. It provides highly scalable options and styles to adapt to any angular project. The best part is it&#x27;s callable only from typescript so it can be used directly in services without HTML templates and it uses observables. 

npm i @costlydeveloper/ngx-awesome-popup



imports: [

    NgxAwesomePopupModule.forRoot(), 

    ConfirmBoxConfigModule.forRoot()

]



confirmBox() {

        const confirmBox &#x3D; new ConfirmBoxInitializer();

        confirmBox.setTitle(&#x27;Are you sure?&#x27;);

        confirmBox.setMessage(&#x27;Confirm to delete user: John Doe!&#x27;);

        confirmBox.setButtonLabels(&#x27;YES&#x27;, &#x27;NO&#x27;);



        // Choose layout color type

        confirmBox.setConfig({

            LayoutType: DialogLayoutDisplay.DANGER // SUCCESS | INFO | NONE | DANGER | WARNING

        });



        // Simply open the popup and listen which button is clicked

        confirmBox.openConfirmBox$().subscribe(resp &#x3D;&gt; {

            // do some action after user click on a button

            console.log(&#x27;Clicked button response: &#x27;, resp);

        });

    }

                    <span>Single page web applications built with the help of various front-end frameworks like angular, react and Vuejs have a large number of third party open source frameworks which can give great support towards achieving a lot of large functionalities and modules including user-interface, tables and grids, forms and validations, translations and a lot more..

The development approach refers to the model adopted by the owner, people and contributors. To look at the pattern and history of the contributors on how did they work on it or why have they designed this approach for the framework. For tech geeks it is easy to identify it as for open source repositories it is very easy to look into branches, codes and commits.

                    <span>Security is hard. It&#x27;s hard because there are so many things that can go wrong along the way. Attackers only need to find one small gap to make it through whereas developers and IT Pros have to think about all the possible attack permutations and potential security vulnerabilities every step of the way. That&#x27;s why we talk about &quot;security in layers&quot; when it comes to building systems that handle sensitive data. And unless you&#x27;re creating static marketing pages, it&#x27;s very likely that your solution will need to work with some data.

                    <span>Background


Ubuntu 21.10 can load on my computer through secure boot, and the shim version is 15.4. Then refer to the official tutorial, I installed rEFInd v0.13.2 (the latest version when I posted this blog) via PPA in Ubuntu 21.10. However, when I restart the system and load rEFInd, it always fails with the message Verification failed:(0x1A)Security Violation. I&#x27;m sure that both refind_local.cer and refind.cer under the EFI/refind/keys/ have been enrolled through MokManager (Although only refind_local.cer is needed through PPA installation).
From this post, I got that rEFInd currently (v0.13.2) lacks the .sbat section. For shim 15.3 and later versions, SBAT is mandatory, resulting in failure to start rEFInd.
The post also indicates that the author of rEFInd is currently studying how to ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Recently at work, I came across an interesting method to handle encryption at scale called envelope encryption. 
First of all, it increases security and helps you ease out the management of encryption keys. But it&#x27;s also a highly recommended pattern by PCI-DSS (Security Standard for Credit Card Processing) and results in much stronger data privacy and data protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). 
When we think of data there are 3 places we can think of encrypting data:
At Rest - On hardware storage devices like on a disk or in your devices 
In Transit - In moving data between different locations like server to server through API calls
In Use - While it&#x27;s being used by a server (New concept and still being researched)
We will be dealing primarily with encryption at rest and‚Ä¶</span>
