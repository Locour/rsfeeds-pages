At FlashDrive.io, we use every day and love modern, static frameworks like Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll, and others.
Gatsby, with its huge community and user base, is the first framework to have a complete build add-on developed on FlashDrive, and we love playing with Gatsby every day.
It&#x27;s also great that Gatsby comes with a large set of plugins to connect with various CMS like WordPress, Ghost, etc.
In this post, we&#x27;ll see why it&#x27;s popular (and actually a good idea) to mix a dynamic CMS like WordPress with a static website generator like Gatsby.
The main advantage to this setup is that you will keep WordPress what it does best: providing a good CMS with a ton of features and integration. Then use Gatsby to deliver a static version of your content without any risk of a hacked plugin and the ability to handle massive traffic even on small configurations like Dev (or ideally Web) FlashDrive instances.
We will install WordPress, add the GraphQL plugin, and install and Gatsby on FlashDrive.io to create a static website that rebuilds automatically each time your website is modified, all of that using FlashDrive&#x27;s unique network and security capabilities and only using FREE dev instances on FlashDrive!
FlashDrive.io is Free for developers, register today to try Gatsby with WordPress for free.</span>

Its database (Firebase Realtime Database) is a NoSQL database where data is stored in JSON like documents. In this tutorial, you&#x27;ll learn how to build an Angular application using Firebase as backend. So, let&#x27;s get started.
Let&#x27;s start by setting up Firebase by signing into the Firebase console. 

Click on the Add project to create a new project. 
You&#x27;ll be prompted to enter a name for your project. We&#x27;ll be naming our project js-scrambler-demo. Next, it&#x27;ll ask you whether to enable Google Analytics for this project or not. We’ll disable it since it&#x27;s not required for this tutorial and click on Create project.

                    <span>Brief insight on containers and VMs
Operating Systems keep track of memory, RAM, Disk and devices, and if you run multiple programs simultaneously, all these resources of OS will be shared among the programs as per their requirements.
Now let&#x27;s take an example where  1 of your programs is using port 80 and another program too needs to run on the same port, and if it tries to use the port, it will crash because port 80 is already in use.
It is one such example where containers and VMs come in use.
If you move your programs into containers or VMs each of them will have its own version of shared resources, files and network ports.
Containers provide the mobility, you can move and run your application easily.
Let&#x27;s take a scenario where you are working on an application on your machine. Now that application will have certain configurations, binaries and other files and if you ship the same application and try to run it on another machine, it won&#x27;t run if the machine does not fulfills the configuration requirements as per the application&#x27;s demand of it. But if you have containerized it and then ship, no such issue will arise.
There are some similarities and so many differences between containers and VMs
Let&#x27;s see that in the next post.
Enough of containers and stuff, let me make one revelation about you, You look best when you smile xD.</span>

The guide key features are: 
Install and run docker
Create and build images
Mount volumes
Create networks
Publish in dockerhub
Use Docker-compose.
After reading the docker official documentation, we understood that Docker gives us the freedom to run our applications everywhere, language and framework-agnostic, and unlock the following points.
Easy way to deliver an application. 
Make easy setup sandbox for development.
No version conflicts and environment consistency. 
Easy to know the dependencies and requirements of our apps.

Kinda kidding, but not really.

                    <span>You&#x27;ll hear the word &quot;DevOps&quot; everywhere these days. DevOps may appear to be a rather simple concept at first glance. Isn&#x27;t the term &quot;DevOps&quot; merely a mix of &quot;Dev&quot; and &quot;Ops&quot;?
However, since its inception roughly a decade ago, DevOps has become a catchall term for any and all trends in software development and IT operations. It&#x27;s understandable, given that DevOps is still expanding, covers a wide range of topics, and is changed and accepted based on a company&#x27;s individual business objectives, priorities, and current knowledge base. We&#x27;ll attempt to present our own principle-based description of what DevOps is at the end of this article, but before we do, it&#x27;s helpful to explore what DevOps is NOT, debunking some of the prevalent misconceptions about DevOps.

                    <span>Terraform is quite large. You have a lot of possibilities do to with, and here are some tips to help you with your scripts.
condition ? true_val : false_val

If quite simple, it looks like ternary condition in Java for example.
true_val will be used, otherwise it will be the false_val.
example
var.a !&#x3D; &quot;&quot; ? var.a : &quot;default-a&quot;

Terraform documentation : https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/expressions/conditionals.html
resource &quot;xxx&quot; &quot;yyyy&quot; {
  ....
  count            &#x3D; &quot;${var.a &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;a&quot; ? 1 : 0}&quot;
}

To create some elements depending conditions, or to create multiple instances of a resource, we can use count.
Mixed with a conditional expression we can defined how much elements the script needs to create. So if you&#x27;re defining a case were the script must create 0 instances, so you have a conditionnal resource.
Documentation : https://dev.to/tbetous/how-to-make-conditionnal-resources-in-terraform-440n
locals {
  service_name &#x3D; &quot;forum&quot;
  owner        &#x3D; &quot;Community Team&quot;

  name &#x3D; &quot;${var.env}-xxxx&quot;
}

locals is an object with static values (which can&#x27;t be overrided by variables) or can help to create some values from the variables inputs.
It can be really useful to avoid redefining a value in multiple resources.

                    <span>Firstly, this question had my attention, now it has my curiosity :) Since I dig into the full-stack monitoring niche, I would appreciate your opinion about the question above.
On the one hand, it&#x27;s always convenient to have a single monitoring solution for several purposes, e.g. IT infrastructure monitoring, log management, synthetic monitoring, etc. It doesn&#x27;t matter if your company is a startup or enterprise, the benefits of an all-in-one solution are obvious:
One place for monitoring, logging, user experience, etc., consequently, one console instead of multiple.


Observability. Explore why an application or system behaves in a certain manner.


Real-time metrics. Correlate application metrics, transaction metrics, and infrastructure metrics to see what’s going on in your apps.



Logically, such an option helps to save company&#x27;s budget and manager&#x27;s &amp; DevOps mental health :)
But, on the other hand, the vast majority of people I know are sure that the existing B2B solutions are not always capable to face all the processes and produce expected results. I don&#x27;t know why. Of course, we talk about solutions such as InsightCat, Elastic.co, Splunk, etc. The main argument is that &quot;there is no decent “full stack” option&quot;.
Perhaps, it depends on the company budget and tech people&#x27;s preferences. But, from my personal perspective, a single full-stack solution is a good option to think about, especially, if you have multiple clouds, SaaS, and a few hundred apps.
My company uses InsigthCat https://insightcat.com/ and we like it. So, I&#x27;m curious to know which side is preferable in your company and why.
Do you stick to all-in-one or splitting?
Thank you.</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s monday. You wake out and reach the office (which may very well be your sofa given the current times), turn on your laptop and open your email software.
A chill goes down your spine. &quot;Make it be not Jira&quot; is the first thought as you open the email.
Feels familiar? I guess everyone had a similar moment in their professional career.
I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to follow the rollout and administrate an Atlassian Jira Cloud instance for a couple of years for a small company, and I don&#x27;t think I have fully recovered yet. The complexity hidden behind that subscription is massive.
After self-reflection, my question is: was it Jira&#x27;s fault? Is the tool to blame for the complexity of the resulting process and the effort it required just to use it for day to day work? Would another tool change the out…</span>

                    <span>Question: Need help with what you guys feel would be the best path to take with my web dev/design a.a.s degree requirements. I tried talking to my academic advisor but he didn&#x27;t seem to know in the slightest honestly.
I will try to find the director of chair for the department and shoot him a message, but I wanted your guys opinions as well
https://imgur.com/a/FZ5fICV
I am finishing up (cpt 103) microcomputers applications and (cpt 165) programming logic this semester. Next semester the academic advisor has me for (cpt 105) ethics in technology and (cpm 120) intro to multimedia (adobe creative cloud) but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should be knocking them out in order or not. The academic advisor said my course does not need to be followed exactly how this list is, and as long as there are no pre class requirements like some of the classes in the 200s, it should be fine.
I wasn&#x27;t sure if just by looking at the titles of the classes if you guys think I should be taking other classes before the intro to multimedia, or if I am ok to take that class before basics of data communications and pc operating systems
Thanks so much!</span>

                    <span>Introduce the need for learning about Docker Networking and an overview of this series
Docker enables massive innovation in today&#x27;s fast-paced IT industry.
And a lot of this is made possible by connecting multiple containers together. 🔌
If you, as an Engineer or Developer, ignore the networking part of Docker, you will miss out on arguably one of its most powerful capabilities.
But, before we understand &quot;WHY&quot; it&#x27;s important, let&#x27;s first answer...
A network is formed when a group of devices is connected over a medium to share data.
The devices (or computer systems) would be connected to the network by some form of physical or virtual interface. 
The medium could be wired or wireless, be it cables, telephone lines or radio waves, etc. 
But the main purpose remains to connect multiple system…</span>

                    <span>A VPN can be a lot of things. You might think you know what a VPN is…but do you really? A virtual private network just sends private traffic over a public network. But where is that traffic going, and for what purpose? After all, networks come in all shapes and sizes.
In this two-part tutorial, we will discuss four “types” of VPN’s, which could just be considered use cases, and set them up with WireGuard® and Netmaker, a free networking platform, in under 10 minutes:
Personal (Private Browsing)


Remote Access


Site-to-Site


Mesh (virtual LAN/WAN)



WireGuard® is a new and very fast VPN technology. Usually, VPN’s make your internet slower. With WireGuard®, the difference is negligible. Netmaker uses WireGuard® under the hood, and can simplify setting up environments from homelab to ente…</span>

                    <span>In this simple tutorial, I will be explaining how to configure your windows subsystem for Linux efficiently and optimize your WSL performance when you&#x27;re running applications through them.
 Everyone has widespread access to windows but they may or maynot be savvy enough to run their favorite flavour of linux due to various constraints
WSL2 really makes life easy for those devs who can&#x27;t access linux through a cloud provider or locally run it on their devices.
WSL has support for various distros like Debian, Arch and Ubuntu.
Now coming to the interesting part, windows has all access to the CPU and memory resources in your device and it is built in a way which will optimize the resource utilization but how do you limit your linux subsystem, let  us say you&#x27;d like to manipulate the configuration to suit your needs the best, then you should follow these steps.
Shut your current running instance of WSL using this command
wsl --shutdown

Run this command through powershell as administrator
Create a configuration file for WSL on your user profile directory
notepad &quot;$env:USERPROFILE\.wslconfig&quot;

 This is the most important step in this project, so please follow carefully 
The following parameters define their corresponding resources:
CPU  &#x3D; &gt; cores dedicated to WSL
Memory  &#x3D; &gt; RAM allocated to WSL
AutoMount  &#x3D; &gt; Mount your default NTFS drive to your subsystem
Boot &#x3D;&gt; defines your booting options for services
Kernel  &#x3D; &gt; Custom kernel for linux
LocalhostForwarding  &#x3D; &gt; for port-forwarding your applications running on localhost
My configuration for CPU and memory:
[wsl2]
memory&#x3D;9GB  
processors&#x3D;4

This is how you can configure your resources for WSL 😀. Feel free to leave some comments down below⬇️.

Note that we skipped many error check and memory management for brevity which are must be included in working version of the code. Refer here for implemention.

                    <span>簡介


Cockpit 是一個由 Red Hat 所資助的開源軟體，做為一個 Linux 的 web 管理介面，讓我們可以用瀏覽器就能管理系統事務而無須動用男子漢的文字指令。
條列式 Cockpit 的功能與特色：
有美美的圖表即時顯示系統負載
顯示一些基本的軟硬體資訊
關機、重開機
顯示系統日誌
管理儲存空間
管理網路介面
管理帳戶
管理服務，不用碰 systemctl

內建終端機，Cockpit web 做不到的事可以在終端機做
模組化設計，可以安裝或自行開發擴充模組
以 Elementary OS / Ubuntu 來說，在出廠的 APT 庫已經內建了 Cockpit，所以只要一行即可裝起來：
sudo apt install cockpit

其它的 Linux 可以參閱 Cockpit 的安裝文件。
安裝之後 Cockpit 會以服務的形式在背景運作，服務的名稱就叫做 Cockpit Web Service。因為是服務，當然也會常態的佔據一部分的記憶體，有必要的話可以改成平時關閉，要用時再用 systemctl 把 Cockpit Web Service 叫起來。（不過我就是不想用 systemctl 來管服務才裝 Cockpit 的啊…）
另外在 Elementary OS / Ubuntu 的 APT 庫內還有一些模組可以安裝，包括 Docker 的管理等等的，可以自行選用。
Cockpit 會在本機的 9090 埠提供服務，所以只要 Cockpit Web Service 有啟動的狀態下，用瀏覽器開 http://localhost:9090/ 就會進到 Cockpit 的登入頁。

登入之後的各模組使用應該是一望即知，就不多做介紹了。
因為 Cockpit 是 web，所以就需要多考慮存取的控制，要禁止本機以外的機器存取到 Cockpit 的話，請在防火牆設定那邊確定沒有開放 9090 埠。
以 Elementary OS 為例，在 系統設定值 安全與隱私 防火牆 那邊可以做設定。

對 9090 埠做限制，禁止外部訪問，或只允許信任的 IP 訪問。</span>

                    <span>Why I switched?


So around 3 months ago I switched to Linux from Windows 10. I have a very low end PC so Windows 10 was lagging a lot so I thought to switch to Linux. 
I definitely ran a lot better than windows. But after some time, It&#x27;s UI also seemed a bit boring to me. So the I installed the KDE PLasma desktop environment on top of it. And I just loved it.
KDE has a lot of features and is very customizable
Very user friendly


Customisation
Noctis Round Theme




Keyboard Shortcuts


Addons 







System Wide Search
KDE has KRunner, which is a system wide search &amp; its much faster than  Window&#x27;s search. 

There are many other features in KDE that I like. 
Conclusion:


I just love KDE Plasma &amp; its a great alternative for Windows. 
I am not switching back to Windows anytime soon. 
So if you want to switch from Windows, try KDE plasma.</span>

For creating a default openssl.conf, Jamie&#x27;s amazing article would be a good start point.
There are many differences between original Windows certificates and those created with using OpenSSL on Linux:
 


  
  
  Difference 1 → Issuer:


Issuer is one of the most important field in the certificates. This must be interpreted correctly in order to make Windows accept our handcrafted certificate. 
Difference between certificate created with default openssl.conf and original Windows certificate:

Em poucas palavras, em comunicação web, é usado o protocolo HTTP (e também o que eu considero a sua variação para conexões &quot;seguras&quot;, o HTTPS), no qual os clientes e servidores trocam dados em vários pequenos pacotes em que cada uma das pontas juntam esses pacotes para formar o documento completo.

A voice-controlled virtual assistant is one step ahead of the legacy Touch-Tone/DTMF controlled one because of the flexibility it allows end users. They can just speak into their phone’s microphone to provide input to control the call.
Building a voice-controlled virtual assistant using Plivo’s automatic speech recognition (ASR) feature in Node.js using Express.js is simple. This guide shows you how to…</span>

                    <span>First things first, if you don&#x27;t know about the NestJS Caching module, It&#x27;s quite easy to understand, It will let you cache whatever you want through the CACHE_MANAGER and take control over it and make decision whether to keep or delete, and keep for how long etc.., Also allowing you to configure your own cache driver which could be Redis, Memcached etc...
First follow the docs for the installation,
https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#installation
here is a snippet to register your cache driver.
import {  CacheModule } from &#x27;@nestjs/common&#x27;;

                    <span>OAuth (stands for Open Authorization) is a standard protocol that allows an app to get delegated access to resources of a 3rd party service like Google, Facebook, Github, etc. OAuth is one of the most popular ways to authorize users in modern web apps because of its:
Security: OAuth doesn&#x27;t share passwords, instead, it uses authorization tokens to identify users. So the consumer&#x27;s password is safe from breaches.
Better UX: It&#x27;s more convenient for users to sign in with a few clicks than to fill out a giant form.
Better DX: OAuth is simple to implement and developers don&#x27;t have to worry about the complexity of authenticating users.
In this article, we will build a Node.js app that uses Google OAuth to sign in users and we will use passport.js which will make the whole process simpler. You c…</span>

This approach I&#x27;m going to outline probably won&#x27;t be worth it for all use cases, so I&#x27;ll focus on a solution for component libraries and design system monorepos that have many components that all share the same source code structure and therefore need the same core styles to use at dev/build time.

                    <span>Cryptography is the practice of concealing the meaning of something so that only those who can interpret the nature of the implemented cryptographic method can receive the original hidden message. 
Cryptography has its origins in the ancient world. Some say it was born in Egypt through the hieroglyphs used to hide messages for only the aristocratic literate scribes could read them. It was also found in Greece through scytales, which were used in battle to pass messages. A sender would tightly wind a leather strip around a stick and write a message that would span across the wound strips, unravel the leather and send it off. The recipient would use a similar stick to rewrap the strip and receive the message. From Rome, &quot;Caeser&#x27;s Cipher&quot; was a method which involved substituting each letter o…</span>

                    <span>Breached password detection protects your users by making sure they aren&#x27;t using passwords that have been seen in previous breaches. An easy way to provide it to your users is:
const {pwnedPassword} &#x3D; require(&#x27;hibp&#x27;);

async function hasPasswordBeenUsedBefore(password) {
    // HIBP asks that you identify yourself through the user agent
    const numTimesUsedBefore &#x3D; await pwnedPassword(password, {userAgent: &quot;whoami&quot;});
    return numTimesUsedBefore &gt; 0;
}

HIBP (or have i been pwned?) is a service that provides APIs on top of past breaches. In the code snippet, I used the library hibp, but there are existing libraries for pretty much every language. The API is easy to use if you prefer to not rely on a library here. Let&#x27;s test our function:

                    <span>This took me days to get the handle of, so here&#x27;s to hoping I can save anybody else the trouble.
so you want to expose some of your queries (but not all!) to public users, so that users can use/interact with your app before having to sign up.  Makes sense!!
Well, it&#x27;s a royal PITA.
Set your Appsync API to be protected by IAM



Create a Cognito identity pool, and create a role for unauthenticated users:



For the unauthenticated role, specifically assign the fields/types you want.



If you&#x27;d like to be confused by AWS&#x27; documentation of how to do this, start here, or here.
Alternatively, you can copy this template where I give access to two subscriptions only:
{
    &quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;,
    &quot;Statement&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;Sid&quot;: &quot;VisualEditor0&quot;,
            &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,
            &quot;Action&quot;: &quot;appsync:GraphQL&quot;,
            &quot;Resource&quot;: [
                &quot;arn:aws:appsync:*:*:apis/*/types/*/fields/onCreateOrders&quot;,
                &quot;arn:aws:appsync:*:*:apis/*/types/*/fields/onUpdateOrders&quot;
            ]
        }
    ]
}

Finally, in our JS code, I use the Amplify SDK, so here&#x27;s how I configure that:
const config &#x3D; awsRealtimeConfig: {
        aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint: &quot;https://.appsync-api..amazonaws.com/graphql&quot;,
        aws_appsync_region: &quot;&quot;,
        aws_appsync_authenticationType: &#x27;AWS_IAM&#x27;,
        Auth: {
            identityPoolId: &#x27;us-east-2:pool-id-here&#x27;,
            region: &#x27;us-east-2&#x27;,

    },

If you&#x27;re a developer, it&#x27;s important for you to have a personal portfolio website – especially when you&#x27;re applying for jobs.
After a few months of development, I have finally put together a multi-themed website that will greatly increase your chances of getting attention from recruiters.
Here is a link to my portfolio - https://www.adrinlol.com/
You can download the source code by going here - https://adrinlol.gumroad.com/l/cHsGL
You will find a detailed documentation inside the README fille on how to setup, make changes and run this website.
This template has several API calls, that is handled by the SWR (stale-while-revalidate), the list includes: 
Medium&#x27;s API to display my personal articles in this project.


Spotify&#x27;s API to show the current track as well as display my top 20 songs of the week. 


GitHub&#x27;s API to highlight most popular of my open-source projects.




  
  
  Technology stack


As for the technologies, here is a full list of libraries I&#x27;m using for this project:
Next.js


styled-components


swr


react-transition-group




  
  
  Lighthouse results


It should come with no surprise that Next.js coupled with SWR is blazing fast, and the results are no surprise.</span>

                    <span>If you write apps using Node.JS, you&#x27;ve probably ended up in then-catch hell.
This code below works, but when you have to do large operations that require you to chain many promises together, it can get super repetitive and hard to read and maintain.
//then-catch hell
somePromise(arg1, arg2, arg3)
 .then((result) &#x3D;&gt; {
   anotherPromise(arg1, arg2, arg3)
     .then((anotherResult) &#x3D;&gt; {

                    <span>Muchas veces tenemos buenas ideas y no la empezamos porque es muy ambicioso, o porque no tenemos dinero, contactos y principalmente por el miedo de fallar. 
Pues a hora pienso diferente, estoy en un momento de mi vida que veo el fallar como parte del proceso. Claro siempre intentando prever los problemas, pero sabiendo que por más que uno se prepare la tempestad vendrá mas tarde o temprano.
Actualmente tengo tres ideas de proyecto, entonces pensé en crear una arquitectura que se pueda pivotar sin afectar otras cosas ya desarrolladas.
Preguntas que me venían:
Como puedo construir un proyecto que se pueda reutilizar por diferentes proyectos?
Como puedo construir un micro servicio separando la reglas de negocio con la tecnología?
Como puedo comunicar mis microservicio de forma rápida?
Y para informaciones que no tengo tanga urgencia, como gerencias grandes cuantidad de mensajes de forma distribuida?
Como puedo multiplicar micro servicios si aumenta mi demanda?
Después de pensar mucho, llegue a esta arquitectura, onde cada microservice esta contenido en un Docker, y todo gestionado por el Kubernetes.

Voy a dejar el Kubernetes por ultimo, por a hora me voy a focar en crear los microservicios conversando por una camada intermediaria llamada Protocol Action. 
Un micro servicio ya esta disponible, dale estrellita y fork, eso me ayuda mucho. :)

Por a hora es esto, voy a intentar a medida que ir desarrollando poner código y más posts, si te interesasteis clica en subscribirte y corazón para saber que quieren más contenido como este.
Pueden entrar en contacto por linkedin para cualquier duda o sugestión.
Hasta luego y no dejen sus proyectos para después! 😀</span>

We chose React Query to handle state management in our React app, and, because our backend team was delayed providing the API that was needed for the projects, we used a fake API to get the library working, and demo its functionality.
All was going according to plan until we had a meeting with the backend team, and Connor, one of the engineers, set us up for a surprise: &quot;We have been thinking and discussing this for a while, and we consider that the best solution we can offer you is to build a GraphQL server you can use to query and mutate the data&quot;.

                    <span>Introduction


At Course Hero, we are starting to build our Apollo Federated Graph Services. For our local environment, we use Kubernetes to deploy our code. Keeping the advantages/disadvantages on the side, when it comes to building our local code it&#x27;s going to take time due that we need to bundle the binary and sync it to K8 to be able to see it.
Our goal is to bundle and ship that local code as soon as possible to reduce the waiting time. Saving seconds here are goals here.
Below we&#x27;re going go into details about how we were able to save around ~21 seconds when it comes to building the app binary, with esbuild 🚀
EsBuild build: Done in around 313ms
Webpack build: Done in around 21.07sec
To give a background on the current setup of the project;

                    <span>Pulumi is an open-source Infrastructure as code (IaC) SDK.
This article shows how to use Pulumi to create a Kubernetes infrastructure.

We&#x27;ll use NodeJs and npm, so install both:
Install NodeJS (10.x or later)
Install npm



You&#x27;ve to install Pulumi CLI:
https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/
install Pulumi on Windows:
$ choco install pulumi

or on Linux:
$ curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com | sh

or on MacOS:
$ brew install pulumi

Let&#x27;s start creating a folder and Pulumi project:
$ mkdir quickstart &amp;&amp; cd quickstart
$ pulumi new kubernetes-typescript

After, finish project setup on prompt:
Set the project name
Set the project description
Create a stack (in this case, we will use dev)

Change index.ts file with the below code:
import * as pulumi from &quot;@pulumi/pulumi&quot;;

                    <span>First things first, if you don&#x27;t know about the NestJS Caching module, It&#x27;s quite easy to understand, It will let you cache whatever you want through the CACHE_MANAGER and take control over it and make decision whether to keep or delete, and keep for how long etc.., Also allowing you to configure your own cache driver which could be Redis, Memcached etc...
First follow the docs for the installation,
https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#installation
here is a snippet to register your cache driver.
import {  CacheModule } from &#x27;@nestjs/common&#x27;;
import {ConfigModule} from &#x27;@nestjs/config&#x27;;
import { config } from &#x27;./shared/config/index&#x27;;

                    <span>I have this pubsub implementation and I was just curious about how would you reduce it any further.
I&#x27;m talking about the implementation, not the TypeScript part.
type Observer &#x3D; (payload: T) &#x3D;&gt; void;

export interface Publer {
  subscribe(
    channel: K,
    observer: Observer,
  ): () &#x3D;&gt; void;
  unsubscribe(channel?: K): void;
  publish(
    channel: K,
    ...a: T[K] extends undefined ? [] : [T[K]]
  ): void;
}

export const publer &#x3D; (): Publer &#x3D;&gt; {
  const eventMap &#x3D; new Map&gt;&gt;();

  return {
    subscribe: (channel, observer) &#x3D;&gt;
      (eventMap.get(channel)?.add(observer) ||
        eventMap.set(channel, new Set([observer]))) &amp;&amp;
      (() &#x3D;&gt; eventMap.get(channel)?.delete(observer)),
    unsubscribe: (channel) &#x3D;&gt;
      channel ? eventMap.get(channel)?.clear() : eventMap.clear(),
    publish: (channel, ...[payload]) &#x3D;&gt;
      eventMap.get(channel)?.forEach((observer) &#x3D;&gt; observer(payload)),
  } as const;
};

This is the smallest way I could come up with.
interface Events {
  login: { token: string }
}

const pubsub &#x3D; publer();

const unsubscribe &#x3D; pubsub.subscribe(&#x27;login&#x27;, ({ token }) &#x3D;&gt; {
  // Payload is inferred based on the event name
})

// Payload is required based on event name
pubsub.emit(&#x27;login&#x27;, { token: &quot;ABC&quot; });

I would love to see what other ways to make it even smaller you guys think of. Cheers!</span>

My name is Kirk. I like making small games with code. And today&#x27;s game is Tic-Tac-Toe. Specifically, this is a post about an alternative algorithm for finding winning combos in Tic-Tac-Toe using a concept called Magic Squares, but also about burnout, productivity, and finding joy in code. The code is all done in React and Typescript, and as always, full links and examples will be provided. If you just want to see the final solution, visit the sandbox here.
Now, normally we&#x27;d start a post like this at the beginning; we&#x27;d talk about the domain of the physical game, and what elements we&#x27;d need in our digital solution. But today we&#x27;re gonna start at the end; we&#x27;re gonna take an existing solution and look at what if we just changed a small bit in an interesting way. Like Marvel&#x27;s Wha…</span>

                    <span>OAuth (stands for Open Authorization) is a standard protocol that allows an app to get delegated access to resources of a 3rd party service like Google, Facebook, Github, etc. OAuth is one of the most popular ways to authorize users in modern web apps because of its:
Security: OAuth doesn&#x27;t share passwords, instead, it uses authorization tokens to identify users. So the consumer&#x27;s password is safe from breaches.
Better UX: It&#x27;s more convenient for users to sign in with a few clicks than to fill out a giant form.
Better DX: OAuth is simple to implement and developers don&#x27;t have to worry about the complexity of authenticating users.
In this article, we will build a Node.js app that uses Google OAuth to sign in users and we will use passport.js which will make the whole process simpler. You c…</span>

Los interceptors en Angular interceptan todas las peticiones http por defecto, pero hay ocasiones en donde deseamos omitir un interceptor para algunas solicitudes.
Antes de la versión 12 de Angular era muy común hacer esto de alguna de las siguientes formas:
Agregar encabezados http en la solicitud http y luego evaluar ese encabezado en el interceptor.
Crear un nuevo httpClient para esa solicitud.
Administrar sus inyecciones de HttpClient con tokens.
Utilizar httpBackend y saltarse todos los interceptors.

I was perplexed.
I know there used to be a need for trackBy.
Experience has shown me little need for it&#x27;s use recently.
Some quick research said that it is only needed if there are issues with performance with modern Angular.
So, I decided to test this out myself.
In my first iteration of testing, I tested loading data to see if there was a difference in load times when displaying them with and without the trackBy. Here are the first set of tests I ran that showed some hopeful results.
Basically, the data was 100,000 records with:

                    <span>As variáveis de ambiente permitem que nós possamos incluir no nosso código condições, parâmetros e valores diferentes de acordo com nosso ambiente. 
Imagine que você utilize uma API Rest de um serviço qualquer, seja ele criado internamente na empresa que você trabalha, seja ele de terceiros e que esse serviço ofereça um endpoint para homologação e outro para produção.
Uma abordagem inicial seria trocar os valores dessa api todas as vezes que quisermos publicar nossa aplicação em produção.
Uma abordagem muito mais elegante é configurar as variáveis de ambiente para que você não tenha que lembrar de trocar o conteúdo de nenhuma variável.
Aqui mostro como fazer isso utilizando o recurso de configuração de ambiente do Angular.
Projetos criados com Angular CLI possuem por padrão um arquivo de configuração chamado environment.ts disponível na pasta environments da sua aplicação.

environment.ts:
export const environment &#x3D; {
  production: false
};

environment.prod.ts
export const environment &#x3D; {
  production: true
};

Veja um exemplo de como usar o environment.
import { environment } from &#x27;../environments/environment&#x27;;

environment &#x3D; environment;

However, at a general level it’s simply describing a set of steps done in a specific order to achieve the desired end result.
Workflow as code simply means that we’re using code to orchestrate and execute a workflow, very likely in a distributed environment. In the site reliability engineering (SRE) or cloud engineering space, these workflows tend to deal with things like cost savings and incident resolution.
In the early days of SRE (when it was still called DevOps), the ability to chain together specified actions with code was a much more daunting task. Let’s take what seems like a simple example: a da…</span>

                    <span>One of the most important command line utility in Linux is sed which is a stream editor.
Essentially what it can do is it allows you to search for String of text or specific pattern and then replace it pattern with whatever you tell sed to replace with, so it is really kind of search and replace function.
sed &#x27;s/find/replace/&#x27; 
newfile

So we are telling sed that go search for the word find then replace it with the word replace and what it does is it searches every lines for its first instance of the word find. So it not gonna replace every instances of find, only the first time it appears on each line from oldfile and then writes it to newfile.
Sometimes you want to replace every find in oldfile you just need to add global substitution g for every instances find.

One of my most popular posts of all time was when I wrote about my beautiful Linux development machine in 2019. Since I got a new machine and a new setup, it naturally calls for a follow-up.
By now, I&#x27;m a die-hard Linux user. It&#x27;s been five years since I&#x27;m using Linux as my primary OS. I would take a Linux machine any day over macOS or Windows. I own a Windows gaming PC and a Macbook pro from work. Still, they are nowhere near the Linux experience, personally for me. My primary driver is my Linux laptop, and I can&#x27;t be any happier with it (well, I can, I&#x27;ll come to that at the end of the post).

                    <span>In this post, I will introduce how to set up the most basic Express server in Node.JS, and how to see that your server is ready to accept requests. We will also use CodePen to write a fetch GET request to your server so you can see a basic request and response from a frontend (built with CodePen) to a backend (built with Replit).
Replit.com and Codepen.io are tools I use all the time when I want to test some code or play around with something. If you want to practice writing HTTP requests, this is a great way to get you set up to do that.
Go to Replit. Click on the Create Repl button. Search templates for Node.js. Replit will assign a random name to your repl but you can change it to whatever makes sense to you.
Now we will set up the Express server.
You can use Node.JS by itself to create…</span>

It is common for many server-side services, including web services, to output and record logs about the behavior of the service. By continuously outputting logs, they can be used for troubleshooting, debugging, responding to security incidents, auditing, and clues for performance improvement. The more information contained in the log, the more clues to solve problems, so it is useful to post as much information as possible (although there is a limit), or to be able to increase the amount of information through configuration.
On the other hand, however, there is some information that is undesirable to output on the server side.

I couldn&#x27;t find a complete example of Next.js authentication with next-iron-session so I used all the little pieces I found online and created one to share.
Before talking about authentication we need to setup the model of the User. To do this we will be using mongoose for flexibility and ease of usage. You can ignore the usage of httpStatus and APIError. Here is the user.model.js inside a models folder at root level.
import mongoose from &#x27;mongoose&#x27;;
import httpStatus from &#x27;http-status&#x27;;
import APIError from &#x27;@/lib/APIError&#x27;;

                    <span>Welcome


Here&#x27;s a quick introduction/presentation so you know what this is and why you&#x27;re reading it. I&#x27;m Merk, a Software Engineering student that really likes reverse engineering (among other things).
In this series we will attempt to reverse engineer and complete challenges from the Reversing.kr website. In this particular case, we will be reversing the password of the challenge Easy Crack.
We&#x27;re given a Windows executable and must crack it. Using DIE we can see it is a 32-bit executable and is not packed.



We could straight up patch the program so that the flow of execution skips the error message and goes to the right place
This would be the cracker&#x27;s way; not the reverser&#x27;s, and would also not give us points since we don&#x27;t reverse engineer the password ;)
We could look for string references
Given that the executable doesn&#x27;t seem to have any protections, and knowing the string &quot;Incorrect Password&quot;, this method can prove to be useful 
We could set a breakpoint on the Win32 API GetDlgItemText/A/W
Because of how the program window looks, it is very likely that the Dialog reads its content using this function
We&#x27;ll test our luck looking for string references. Let&#x27;s fire up x64dbg, attach the executable and look for strings in the main module.

&quot;Congratulation !!&quot; - the good boy
&quot;Incorrect Password&quot; - the bad boy




returns 1, and makes the flow end up executing the bad boy. Taking a look inside, we can see it compares [EBP+C] which contains &quot;5y&quot; with our string starting from the third letter, which is stored in ESI. This is done via &quot;repe cmpsb&quot;, which essentially compares several characters.



return 0, and the flow of execution gets further into the program.

&quot;R3versing&quot; is stored in ESI before some comparisons.</span>

                    <span>Hawk is a network and pentest utility that I developed so that I could perform different kinds of task using the same suite, instead of jumping from one tool to another.
ifconfig, 
ping, 
traceroute, 
port scans (including SYN, TCP, UDP, ACK, comprehensive scan), 
host discovery (scan for up devices on a local network), 
MAC address detection (get MAC address of a host IP on a local network), 
banner grabbing, 
DNS checks (with geolocation information), 
WHOIS, 
subdomain enumeration, 
vulnerability reconnaissance, - 
packet sniffing, 
MAC spoofing, 
IP spoofing, 
SYN flooding, 
deauth attack, 
brute-force attack (beta).
Other features are still being implemented. Future implementations may include WAF detection, DNS enumeration, traffic analysis, XSS vulnerability scanner, ARP cache poisoning, DNS cache poisoning, MAC flooding, ping of death, network disassociation attack (not deauth attack), OSINT, exploits, some automated tasks and others.

Reading the content of the page, at the first glance, it tells us that there is a query parameter called html, which is capable of define partially what&#x27;s displayed to the user. When we define, for example, a 
 tag to this parameter, we are going to get returned a page with this tag being reflected, which is already an HTML injection. From now on, we will be working to make it become an XSS.

If we simply try to inject something like alert(document.domain);, this script tag will be reflected, but the code itself will not be executed. Why? Well, if we look at the head of the page, we are going to find something interesting:

Do you use functions / methods to implement various conditions and DOM manipulations in Angular ? If yes, trust me it will worsen your website performance. In this tutorial I will explain how pipes increase your angular website performance and what are the various benefits of using Pipe over Functions based on a case study.
Before diving straight into tutorial, let’s start with some basic questions.
The first question comes in mind- What is Pipe? A simple definition of pipe- it is a decorative function in Angular used to manipulate DOM. It takes an untransformed value as input and returns a transformed value as output.
Various built-in pipes are provided by Angular- AsyncPipe, CurrencyPipe,…</span>

                    <span>👋 hi all - this article is a continuation of a previous article that explains the goals of the DeRxJS pattern:
entirely de-couple state management code from presentational code (to the point where your state management code could be re-used across frameworks)
maximize the benefits of RxJS, while minimizing the negatives
next-level testing [and potential to hand over all our state-management code to AI at some point]
In that article, we did most of the heavy lifting - developing our state-management code and fully testing out every edge case with &quot;timeline testing&quot; (allowing us to assert not only &quot;what&quot; state looks like, but &quot;when&quot; it should look that way as well).

                    <span>Given


that I am dyslexic and also suffer from aphantasia, which is a fascinating quirk of the brain, one  can imagine I have sort of a love / hate relationship with reading. 
On the one hand, I must keep up with the news and trends of the software engineering industry but the serious and useful information I require, is in written form and that always drains my reading battery because of the above average amount of concentration I have to put forward.
daylight saving Weekend rolled around, I decided to do something useful with the &quot;additional&quot; hour, so I set out to improve this situation for people like me.

                    <span>When we use Angular&#x27;s schematics to generate components, unnecessary asynchronous code is added to the test setup hook for its test suite.
The following test setup is generated by Angular&#x27;s component generation schematic:
beforeEach(async () &#x3D;&gt; {
  await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  }).compileComponents();
});

component schematic.





Alternatively, we might be using Angular&#x27;s waitForAsync test function wrapper (formerly named async) as seen in the following code snippet:
beforeEach(waitForAsync(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  }).compileComponents();
}));

waitForAsync.





Here&#x27;s the deal: It&#x27;s only necessary to call the static TestBed.compileComponents method if we&#x27;re not using the Angular CLI to run our tests (who would do such a thing, Google? 👈😏).
The Angular CLI compiles our application and tests before the tests are run so no asynchronous action is needed for setting up the declarables.
Let&#x27;s simplify the common test setup by leaving out async-await, waitForAsync, and even the TestBed.compileComponents invocation as seen in this code snippet:
beforeEach(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  });
});

The following points are true for common Angular testbed setup for tests covering all types of Angular declarables:
No need to use async-await
No need to use waitForAsync (formerly named async)
No need to call TestBed.compileComponents



Of course, there might be other reasons for introducing asynchronicity to our test setup but compiling and linking declarables is not one of them.
Enjoy a little less boilerplate in your Angular tests 🌞</span>

                    <span>One of the most powerful features when creating Angular components is the Async Pipe. The greatest thing about it is that it allows you to take advantage of asynchronous rendering in your template without having to worry about subscribing and unsubscribing from Observables.
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;
import { of, Subject } from &#x27;rxjs&#x27;;
import { delay, startWith, takeUntil } from &#x27;rxjs/operators&#x27;;

@Component({
  selector: &#x27;my-app&#x27;,
  template: &#x60;
    
Async example
 
    
Items
 
    
{{item}}
Other Items
 
    
{{other}}
 this.otherItems &#x3D; other)
  }
  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.destroy$.next();
    this.destroy$.complete();
  }
}


Check it out on Stackblitz.
As you can see, in the first example, we are rendering a list (items) using the async pipe in the HTML template. There is no need for the additional handling after the component is destroyed, which you can see is not the case for the other list otherItems.   That is simply because the async pipe is going to take care of that for you.</span>
