La mayoría de aplicaciones que construimos no son páginas estáticas, hay un estado y hay diferentes tipos de componentes donde el estado podría vivir.‌

Muy conocidos como Dumb o componentes tontos. Usan Inputs/Outputs para su comunicación. 
Enviamos un valor al container, renderizamos los valores del container; emite un evento cuando está listo y algún otro componente administra el estado y hace las actualizaciones respectivas del estado.

                    <span>The Dog constructor from the last post worked well. However, notice that all Dogs that are created with the Dog constructor are automatically named Anakin, are brown in color, and have four legs. What if you want dogs with different values for name and color? It&#x27;s possible to change the properties of each dog manually but that would be a lot of work:




let husky &#x3D; new Dog();
husky.name &#x3D; &quot;Rex&quot;;
husky.color &#x3D; &quot;blue&quot;;

Suppose you were writing a program to keep track of hundreds or even thousands of different dogs in an aviary. It would take a lot of time to create all the dogs, then change the properties to different values for every one. To more easily create different Dog objects, you can design your Dog constructor to accept parameters:




function Dog(name, color) {
  this.name &#x3D; name;
  this.color &#x3D; color;
  this.numLegs &#x3D; 4;
}

let terrier &#x3D; new Dog(&quot;Ewok&quot;, &quot;tan&quot;);

Then pass in the values as arguments to define each unique dog into the Dog constructor: let terrier &#x3D; new Dog(&quot;Ewok&quot;, &quot;tan&quot;); This gives a new instance of Dog with name and color properties set to Ewok and tan, respectively. The numLegs property is still set to 4. The terrier has these properties:




console.log(terrier.name); // will print out Ewok
console.log(terrier.color); // will print out tan
console.log(terrier.numLegs); // will print out 4

The constructor is more flexible. It&#x27;s now possible to define the properties for each Dog at the time it is created, which is one way that JavaScript constructors are so useful. They group objects together based on shared characteristics and behavior and define a blueprint that automates their creation.</span>

                    <span>Here&#x27;s the Dog constructor from the previous post:




function Dog() {
  this.name &#x3D; &quot;Anakin&quot;;
  this.color &#x3D; &quot;brown&quot;;
  this.numLegs &#x3D; 4;
}

let hound &#x3D; new Dog();

NOTE: this inside the constructor always refers to the object being created.
Notice that the new operator is used when calling a constructor. This tells JavaScript to create a new instance of Dog called hound. Without the new operator, this inside the constructor would not point to the newly created object, giving unexpected results. Now hound has all the properties defined inside the Dog constructor:




hound.name; // when console.log it will print out Anakin
hound.color; // when console.log it will print out brown
hound.numLegs; // whem console.log it will print out 4

Just like any other object, its properties can be accessed and modified:




hound.name &#x3D; &#x27;Obi-Wan Kenobi&#x27;;
console.log(hound.name); // will print out Obi-Wan Kenobi</span>

                    <span>Constructors are functions that create new objects. They define properties and behaviors that will belong to the new object. Think of them as a blueprint for the creation of new objects.


Here is an example of a constructor:




function Dog() {
  this.name &#x3D; &quot;Anakin&quot;;
  this.color &#x3D; &quot;brown&quot;;
  this.numLegs &#x3D; 4;
}

This constructor defines a Dog object with properties name, color, and numLegs set to Anakin, brown, and 4, respectively. Constructors follow a few conventions:
Constructors are defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from other functions that are not constructors.


Constructors use the keyword this to set properties of the object they will create. Inside the constructor, this refers to the new object it will create.


Constructors define properties and behaviors instead of returning a value as other functions might.</span>

For this article I’m going to assume you already understand the basics of Angular routing and components. I won’t bore you with building an entire application. We’ll get right to adding animations so you can see immediate results!
The finished code for this example can be found here.
In your app.module.ts add BrowserAnimationsModule to the module imports.
...
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from &#x27;@angular/platform-browser/animations&#x27;;
@NgModule({
    imports: [
        ...,
        BrowserAnimationsModule
    ],
    ...
})
export class AppModule {}

For unit testing, import NoopAnimationsModule instead. This fulfills the contracts while isolating unit tests from having to deal with the transitions.

                    <span>Thanks to the Angular CLI and the Cypress Schematic, spinning up a new Angular 12 project with Cypress is incredibly easy.
Here&#x27;s how to do it in less than 2 minutes:
Install the Angular CLI if you haven&#x27;t and create a new project:




ng new angular-cypress-demo

Navigate to the newly created project directory and install the Cypress Angular Schematic via the CLI:




ng add @cypress/schematic

Once you&#x27;ve completed these steps, Cypress will be set up with a default config, and basic files and folders will be installed within your project in the cypress folder - including an initial test.

Snowtrack is an intuitive, easy-to-use, and super-fast version control software for graphic projects. Its purpose is to make version control accessible to graphic designers and 2D/3D artists with a non-technical workflow.
To get a better understanding of Snowtracks user interface check out the following screenshot:

                    <span>Today I was helping a new guy in angular with differences between the bind data in Angular, because it provides 2 ways to move data to DOM, One-way and two-way data binding it help us to build dynamic apps.
It binds the data from our component to the DOM, unidirectional from component to view or view to the component in few ways.
The interpolation is used with {{myproperty}} in the DOM.
{{myproperty}}



Angular understand bind events using parentheses like (click) for DOM element or (userSelected) components event trigger.
Close window


Angular two-way data binding is bi-directionally communication, using the directive (ngModel) with combination of square brackets and parentheses of the event binding.
The ngModel is part of FormsModule from @angular/forms, it needs to be import in your app.module.ts
import { FormsModule } from &quot;@angular/forms&quot;;
 @NgModule({ 
   imports: [BrowserModule, FormsModule], 
   declarations: [ AppComponent],

                    <span>Demo -

   
Step 1 - Install lightobox

Open your terminal and run below command -
npm install --save ngx-lightbox

Step 2 - Update your angular.json
{ &quot;styles&quot;: [&quot;./node_modules/ngx-lightbox/lightbox.css&quot;, ...],}

Step 3 - Add Lightbox Module to your app.module.ts
import { LightboxModule } from &#x27;ngx-lightbox&#x27;; @NgModule({ imports: [LightboxModule]})

You can do the next steps in your choice of components but I am assuming I need to make lightbox in app.component.html  
Step 4 - Add markup to html of your component

app.component.html
 

Step 5 - Add lightbox code to your component&#x27;s ts file,

app.component.ts
import { Lightbox } from &#x27;ngx-lightbox&#x27;; 

export class AppComponent { 
private _album: Array &#x3D; []; 

constructor(private _lightbox: Lightbox) {
 for (let i &#x3D; 1; i &lt;&#x3D; 4; i++) {
 const src &#x3D; &#x27;demo/img/image&#x27; + i + &#x27;.jpg&#x27;; const caption &#x3D; &#x27;Image &#x27; + i + &#x27; caption here&#x27;; 
 const thumb &#x3D; &#x27;demo/img/image&#x27; + i + &#x27;-thumb.jpg&#x27;; 
 const album &#x3D; { src: src, caption: caption, thumb: thumb }; 
this._albums.push(album); 
} 
} 

open(index: number): void { // open lightbox 
this._lightbox.open(this._albums, index); 
} 

close(): void { // close lightbox programmatically 
this._lightbox.close(); 
}}

Regardless of what kind of software it is, most apps use some sort of state. Whether it’s internal state or data fetched from an API, state management is a key element to building software. 
However, as an application grows, it becomes harder to track and manage those stateful variables. Updating the state in a predictable and effective manner becomes more difficult and can make it easier for bugs to sneak in. This is especially worse when there are no strict guidelines and code documentation.
A better alternative to managing state like this are state machines. State machines offer a predictable way to manage state by utilising a well-known mathematical concept called Automata Theory.
Let’s dive in a little deeper and break down what this means.

                    <span>The last post introduced a method to the dog object. It used dog.name dot notation to access the value for the name property within the return statement:




sayName: function() {return &quot;The name of this dog is &quot; + dog.name + &quot;.&quot;;}

While this is a valid way to access the object&#x27;s property, there is a pitfall here. If the variable name changes, any code referencing the original name would need to be updated as well. In a short object definition, it isn&#x27;t a problem, but if an object has many references to its properties there is a greater chance for error.


A way to avoid these issues is with the this keyword:




let dog &#x3D; {
  name: &quot;Anakin&quot;,
  numLegs: 4,
  sayName: function() {return &quot;The name of this dog is &quot; + this.name + &quot;.&quot;;}
};

dog.sayLegs();

this is a deep topic, and the above example is only one way to use it. In the current context, this refers to the object that the method is associated with: dog. If the object&#x27;s name is changed to husky, it is not necessary to find all the references to dog in the code. It makes the code reusable and easier to read.</span>

                    <span>Objects can have a special type of property, called a method.
Methods are properties that are functions. This adds different behavior to an object. 


Here is the dog example with a method:




let dog &#x3D; {
  name: &quot;Anakin&quot;,
  numLegs: 4,
  sayName: function() {return &quot;The name of this dog is &quot; + dog.name + &quot;.&quot;;}
};

console.log(dog.sayName()); // would print the string The name of this dog is Anakin.

The example adds the sayName method, which is a function that returns a sentence giving the name of the dog. Notice that the method accessed the name property in the return statement using dog.name. The next challenge will cover another way to do this.</span>

                    <span>The last challenge created an object with various properties. Now you&#x27;ll see how to access the values of those properties.


Here&#x27;s an example:




let dog &#x3D; {
  name: &quot;Anakin&quot;,
  numLegs: 4
};
console.log(dog.name); // would print the value Anakin
console.log(dog.name); // would print the value 4

Dot notation is used on the object name, dog, followed by the name of the property, name, to access the value of Anakin.</span>

                    <span>Think about things people see every day, like cars, shops, and birds. These are all objects: tangible things people can observe and interact with.


What are some qualities of these objects? A car has wheels. Shops sell items. Birds have wings. These qualities, or properties, define what makes up an object. Note that similar objects share the same properties, but may have different values for those properties. For example, all cars have wheels, but not all cars have the same number of wheels.


Here&#x27;s an example using these concepts to create a dog object:




let dog &#x3D; {
  name: &quot;Anakin&quot;,
  numLegs: 4
};

This dog object has two property/value pairs: a name of Anakin and a numLegs of 4.</span>

✅ YES, we can! And I will show you how I did it.
I recently had to deal with a legacy code base of a .Net Full Framework project.
The source code was versioned on GitHub and there was a pull request and code review flow for integrating source code into the main branch. However, there were no checks to verify the code that was being integrated, which would allow source code that did not compile, or that broke unit tests, to be included in our main branch without any alerts.
The absence of quick feedback on the health of the integrated source code created some sense of insecurity in the developers during the approval of the pull requests, since problems inserted through the addition of new code could take much lon…</span>

                    <span>What is Docker?


Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.
In a way, Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they&#x27;re running on and only requires applic…</span>

                    <span>This is the shopping.csv CSV file that we will be working with throughout this blog post.
item,price
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

The goal is to create a one-line bash script that prints the sum of the prices in the file above, which is 7.77.
Step: 1. Print the file content
$ cat shopping.csv

This command prints the file content without modifications.
Output:
item,price
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

Step: 2. Cut the first line
There are many ways to achieve it, but we use the tail +n syntax.
In our case, it takes all the lines until the end of the file, starting from the second line.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2

Output:
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

Step: 3. Cut the first column
awk splits each line by a separator defined by the option -F.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , &#x27;{print $2}&#x27;

Output:
2.49
1.49
3.79

Step: 4. Concatenate the prices
xargs is used to &quot;squash&quot; the lines into a single string, separating them by space.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , &#x27;{print $2}&#x27; | xargs

Output:
2.49 1.49 3.79

Step: 5. Replace spaces with pluses
The sed expression replaces the escaped space with + in the entire string (globally - g).
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , &#x27;{print $2}&#x27; | xargs | sed -e &#x27;s/\ /+/g&#x27;

Output:
2.49+1.49+3.79

Step: 6. Perform the calculation
bc is a simple calculator that you can use interactively or by piping an equation into it.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , &#x27;{print $2}&#x27; | xargs | sed -e &#x27;s/\ /+/g&#x27; | bc

Output:
7.77</span>

For a long time, I was just using the default software on Ubuntu but I was really frustrated, they were no way to annotate them to highlight a particular part. Moreover, I often felt the need to show things with an animated screenshot but just did not know how to do so.

to expose the nginx app on http://HOST_IP:8080 , or less commonly, attaching directly to the host’s network:
docker run -d --net host --name nginx nginx

where no port forwarding rule is required, because it will bind ports as required to the host network.

We all know database operations are costly and is always a good idea to have some sort of cache of it near our frontend application for faster access and operations and is also much better to have to interact with it through a rest api without the need to interact with all that drivers and connections stuffs.
What problem does i think it solve?

                    <span>Hi there 👋
Every application, you&#x27;ll agree, needs a back-end. And there are many languages and tools that can accomplish that. But, in this quick tutorial, I&#x27;ll show you how to set up the GraphQL backend server with Node, and PostgreSQL- a quite common stack for building robust back-ends that operate with large amounts of data. Be that as it may, I&#x27;m assuming you did your research, hence you decided on this tool combination.
First, let&#x27;s define the structure of the server.
▶ Paste this into terminal: npm init -y and create the required files and folders

Now, do install all the packages we&#x27;ll need: npm i apollo-server graphql graphql-tag pg
In the index.js, the entry point of our project, we paste this:
const { ApolloServer } &#x3D; require(&quot;apollo-server&quot;);
const typeDefs &#x3D; require(&quot;./graphql…</span>

Offering a suite of database tools and type safety for your database, it is a useful addition to the eco system for beginner or expert alike. There are already first party clients written in Typescript and Go by Prisma but there are other community driven clients written in other languages. Initial focus was on SQL database connections but work has begun on a MongoDB connector and in future other databases too. During this article, we will be connecting to a Postgres database so, if you don&#x27;t have Postgres installed, please install it.

Snowtrack is an intuitive, easy-to-use, and super-fast version control software for graphic projects. Its purpose is to make version control accessible to graphic designers and 2D/3D artists with a non-technical workflow.
To get a better understanding of Snowtracks user interface check out the following screenshot:

At some point you will probably need to store a user&#x27;s auth token on the device, so they won&#x27;t need to auth whenever they use your app. This is a solved problem on Android with EncryptedSharedPreferences and iOS with the Keychain Services API. But if you&#x27;re creating a mobile app using Kotlin Multiplatform, the KMP solution might not be as clear. Today we&#x27;ll go over how to store encrypted key-value data with KMP without having to reinvent the wheel.
Multiplatform Settings is a solid multiplatform key-value store, created by Touchlab&#x27;s own Russell Wolf, used extensively at Touchlab, as well as in Jetbrains&#x27; KMM Production Sample. There is a Settings interface that is implemented for Android, iOS, MacOS, and JVM platforms. At first glance, it doesn&#x27;t look like Multiplatform Settings o…</span>

There obviously is more of a complex process involved in setting up a social login but for a user its as simple as clicking a buttons to log in. The ease of not having to remember an ID/password and just being able to signup/login through the click of a button is extremely beneficial to the user

                    <span>Controlling the flow of events on a frontend can appear to be a simple task but it becomes significantly more challenging as there are more elements that need to be controlled in unison. In this post I&#x27;m going to discuss best practices for controlling many objects at once using a unified store of state. This technique is called finite state machines and it is frequently used with backend code because it can eliminate whole classes of errors by ensuring that the app never goes into combinations of states that are flat out prohibited from happening.
I found using a unified store of state immensely useful in developing the home page for an app that I just released called Source Compare which allows people version control images within their team to keep everyone on the same page.

                    <span>If you&#x27;re working with NodeJS applications, you probably has process.env.VARIABLE statements all around your code base. The most simple method to configure an application is installing dotenv and creating that lovely .env file on the root folder of your project.
This approach, however, has some pitfalls and is error prone. What if you don&#x27;t set that process.env port? You&#x27;ll probably have a default value (maybe 3000?), but you will need to run your application to discover such type of thing.
That same problem has been solved by typescript for almost anything. When you have the help of static typing, you can discover some errors a lot faster. That said, how can you use Typescript to have a type-safe way to access configurations?
Take a look at that short snippet:
export class EnvironmentService {

  public constructor(
   private readonly variables: Environment
  ) {
    // some logic to assign process.env to this.variables
    // you can use, for instance, 
    this.variables &#x3D; Joi.attempt(process.env))
  }

  public get(name: keyof Environment) {
    return this.variables[name];
  }
}

In a nutshell,
First, you need to define an interface for you environment;
Then, you do pass it as a type parameter to the EnvironmentService class when instantiating a new object;
Finally, use something like class-validator, Joi or you library of choice to assert if the process.env object has all required variables and assign its value to the variables attribute;
After those simple steps, you can use the method get to fetch all possible environment variables with the help of typescript to guide your choice - and if you need, you can cast the value to some desired type:

                    <span>How to handle live data using WebSockets together with React Query has been one of the most asked questions lately, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, play around with it a bit and report my findings. That&#x27;s what this post is about :)
Simply put, WebSockets allow push messages, or &quot;live data&quot;, to be sent from the server to the client (browser). Usually with HTTP, the client makes a request to the server, specifying that they would like some data please, the server responds with that data or an error and then the connection closes.
Since the client is the one opening the connections and initiating the requests, that leaves no room for the server to push data to the client when the server knows that an update is available.
That&#x27;s where WebSockets kick in.
Like with any other HTTP request, the b…</span>

                    <span>Fala dev, beleza ? Me chamo Hudson, sou desenvolver mobile com React Native e esse é o meu primeiro post aqui no dev.to. 
Normalmente utilizo a própria funcionalidade de artigos do Linkedln para fazer minhas publicações, porém como esse é o meu primeiro conteúdo mais técnico, decidi migrar para cá.
Espero que goste :D
Quando comecei a desenvolver com React Native, senti muita falta de uma etapa quase que obrigatória no desenvolvimento web com ReactJS e Styled-Components que era a declaração das fontes e cores globais da nossa aplicação. A alternativa que eu utilizava na web consiste em usar a funcionalidade createGlobalStyle como parte da nossa aplicação.

Minha maior dúvida era: como faço isso com react-native ? Visto que não consigo utilizar essa função createGlobalStyled.

                    <span>Prisma is a nodejs ORM written in Rust that is rapidly growing in popularity. Offering a suite of database tools and type safety for your database, it is a useful addition to the eco system for beginner or expert alike. There are already first party clients written in Typescript and Go by Prisma but there are other community driven clients written in other languages. Initial focus was on SQL database connections but work has begun on a MongoDB connector and in future other databases too. During this article, we will be connecting to a Postgres database so, if you don&#x27;t have Postgres installed, please install it.

                    <span>I developed a version control software for graphic designers and 2D/3D artists called Snowtrack in Angular and Electron. In this blog post, I will cover some technical challenges about file locks which I faced during the development of Snowtrack.
Snowtrack is an intuitive, easy-to-use, and super-fast version control software for graphic projects. Its purpose is to make version control accessible to graphic designers and 2D/3D artists with a non-technical workflow.
To get a better understanding of Snowtracks user interface check out the following screenshot:

For the UI application I used a combination of Angular and Electron. The underlying version control engine is called SnowFS, an open-source project I developed as a fast and simple alternative to Git and Git LFS. Feel free to check it …</span>

In addition, JavaScript is used by Angular, one of the most popular frontend frameworks. Around 65% of JS developers currently use TypeScript.
JavaScript has historically been the primary language for scripting web pages and applications on the Internet. However, with frameworks like Node.js and Deno, it is now feasible to utilize JavaScript on both the frontend and backend.
TypeScript is a programming language

                    <span class="article-reading-time">(3 min)</span>
                    <span>Demo -

   
Step 1 - Install lightobox

Open your terminal and run below command -
npm install --save ngx-lightbox

Step 2 - Update your angular.json
{ &quot;styles&quot;: [&quot;./node_modules/ngx-lightbox/lightbox.css&quot;, ...],}

Step 3 - Add Lightbox Module to your app.module.ts
import { LightboxModule } from &#x27;ngx-lightbox&#x27;; @NgModule({ imports: [LightboxModule]})

You can do the next steps in your choice of components but I am assuming I need to make lightbox in app.component.html  
Step 4 - Add markup to html of your component

app.component.html
 

Step 5 - Add lightbox code to your component&#x27;s ts file,

app.component.ts
import { Lightbox } from &#x27;ngx-lightbox&#x27;; 

export class AppComponent { 
private _album: Array &#x3D; []; 

constructor(private _lightbox: Lightbox) {
 for (let i &#x3D; 1; i &lt;&#x3D; 4; i++) {
 const src &#x3D; &#x27;demo/img/image&#x27; + i + &#x27;.jpg&#x27;; const caption &#x3D; &#x27;Image &#x27; + i + &#x27; caption here&#x27;; 
 const thumb &#x3D; &#x27;demo/img/image&#x27; + i + &#x27;-thumb.jpg&#x27;; 
 const album &#x3D; { src: src, caption: caption, thumb: thumb }; 
this._albums.push(album); 
} 
} 

open(index: number): void { // open lightbox 
this._lightbox.open(this._albums, index); 
} 

close(): void { // close lightbox programmatically 
this._lightbox.close(); 
}} 


With all that being said, I highly recommend you keep learning!

  name: &quot;the-car&quot;,
  props: {

the types/common/index.d.ts declaration file:

  Topics covered in this blogpost:



Architectural pattern that is used for creating custom hook with axios.get().
Implementation of custom hook.
Usage in the actual component.
More usecases for the custom hook like addition of adhoc redux actions, and multiple REST method implementation.
Every custom hook generally returns a state, it may or may not have a useEffect inside it. Let us name our custom hook as useFetch. According to the Rules of Hook every custom hook should have use as a keyword in front of it to recognize it as a hook.

                    <span>Dockerized applications and automated pipelines mean that you will eventually need a docker registry sooner or later.
It is essentially a place where you store Docker images organized in repositories. You can push images to the remote Docker registry and pull images where you want them.
Nifty service that Docker.com runs is Docker hub or a Docker Registry that has many things automated so you don&#x27;t have to bother with configuring it on your own server (which we will get to in a bit).
Free tier is also fairly generous at Docker hub because it provides you with unlimited public repositories and one private repository. More private repositories are available in paid tiers and you can find pricing info here: Docker Pricing

                    <span>I have an old HP 4050N. For a variety of reasons, I want to have it behind a print server instead of having our laptops print directly to it. Here&#x27;s how I set that up.
A Raspberry Pi (or honestly any Linux box) running docker. I like the Raspberry Pi and Odroid HC2 for this sort of thing because they have very low power consumption.
A printer that is supported by CUPS




  
  
  Setup


There are several docker images out there you can use, I made one (the source is on github at unixorn/docker-cupsd) because I wanted one that was multi-architecture - mine has AMD64, ARM7 and ARM64 all baked into the same image so you don&#x27;t have to change the image label based on what system you&#x27;re running it on. It works fine on Raspberry Pi, Odroids and Intel servers.
The unixorn/cupsd image is a bit on the large side because I crammed a lot of printer drivers into it, you may want to look for docker images that only support single printer families.
We&#x27;re going to store printers.conf in a directory outside the container so that we don&#x27;t lose our printer configuration every time we upgrade our container.
I run the cupsd server on an Odroid HC2 because I have /var/lib/docker on the 2TB drive attached to it. I could have put it on one of the Raspberry Pis in my cluster, but didn&#x27;t want it spooling print jobs and causing excessive wear on a rPi&#x27;s microSD card.
Make a directory to store your printer configuration. We&#x27;ll use /docker/cupsd/etc

export CUPSD_DIR&#x3D;&#x27;/docker/cupsd/etc&#x27;
touch $CUPSD_DIR/printers.conf
Run the cupsd server with




sudo docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 631:631 \
  --privileged \
  -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
  -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
  -v &quot;$CUPSD_DIR/printers.conf:/etc/cups/printers.conf&quot; \
  unixorn/cupsd

You can now connect to http://SERVER:631 and add printers using the web UI.
When adding the printers to your Mac, select Internet Printing Protocol and put in the IP or DNS name of your print server machine.
The queues are printers/printername, not printername.</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got an old HP laser printer in my basement. We barely print 10 pages a month between the two of us, so we only turn it on when we&#x27;re going to print. That&#x27;s a hassle though, because inevitably we forget to shut it off sometimes and it stays on overnight or even for days, and while it has a powersave mode, the 4050N is so old that even that burns a good amount of power.
Enter Home Assistant.
The watcher script and associated tooling all presume that we can send messages to a MQTT topic that HA is watching.
Your computers should be configured to print to the cupsd server instead of directly to the printer.
I run cupsd in a container on one of my Odroids. I could run it on the same Odroid HC2 that I run Home Assistant (HA) on, but there&#x27;s no compelling reason to do so and I&#x27;m reserving th…</span>

                    <span>This is a simple instruction to help you override the Armbian&#x27;s setup utilities that require your password to be long and not a dictionary word.

Think of a disposable, long password and write it down in Notepad or other text editor
Use it as your new root password
Create a primary user account and use the same password for the account password.
Finish and exit the the setup utilities
Now, you should be able to enter commands using the user &quot;root&quot;. Use the following commands to change the password for &quot;root&quot; and your newly created user




passwd root
(Follow on screen instruction to type in your less secure password)

passwd your_newly_created_user
(Follow on screen instruction to type in your less secure password again)


There might be some debate on why you would want your password simple instead of using a complex one to improve security. 
In my case, I am setting up an environment on ZeroPi that try to match the Raspberry Pi OS in which it is easier for students to get started with Raspberry Pi&#x27;s teaching materials (And one of them is the default user &quot;pi&quot; with password &quot;raspberry&quot;). But in general if you are using this system yourself, I would recommend a more complex and secure password for root instead.</span>

                    <span>MERN Stack 🚂


The MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack is very popular for making full stack applications, utilizing Javascript for both the backend and frontend as well as a document-oriented or non relational database (MongoDB), meaning that it&#x27;s structured like JSON rather than a large excel sheet like SQL databases are. 
This stack uses Express for the backend, and Express typically accompanies a view engine like Pug or EJS to render HTML dynamically. However, the MERN stack introduces a problem. React renders the frontend code with JSX, so you can&#x27;t use those view engines, and you instead need a new way to render backend data for the client. You might suggest using JSX as your backend view engine, but then you would be losing a lot of the functionality that React brings to t…</span>

                    <span>Trying to integrate with an E-commerce platform for a mobile app by sending PDF invoices through a node express app
So the idea was to fetch the PDF data and return it to the client
The url is not directly used in the client as the E-commerce app requires api-key which is only defined in the server app
const axios &#x3D; require(&#x27;axios&#x27;);
const url &#x3D; &quot;http://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf&quot;
axios.defaults.headers.common[&#x27;Authorization&#x27;] &#x3D; &quot;secret-key&quot;;

app.get(&#x27;/download&#x27;, async function(req, res) {
   try {
      // Fetch PDF from desired url
      const pdf &#x3D; await axios.get(url);

      // Set response header to pdf 
      res.setHeader(&#x27;Content-Type&#x27;, &#x27;application/pdf&#x27;);

      // Return PDF data to client
      return res.send(pdf.data);
    } catch (err) {

      // Throw if any error occurred
      return res.status(400).json(err);
    }
});

Testing this endpoint, a blank PDF document response was returned
Going through multiple forms and docs, trying different methods to achieve the same end result
Until I found the answer when I was just giving up where axios have a problem with requesting PDF
Where { responseType: &#x27;arraybuffer&#x27; } is provided to axios options api
      await axios.get(url,{responseType:&#x27;arraybuffer&#x27;});</span>

                    <span>Accessing wifi is not a problem while you are at home - it’s secure, easy to connect and no strangers are using your home network. However, when you are outside, using public Wi-Fi will give you a nightmare if you aren&#x27;t aware of the risk of security issues. So, if you are considering whether to connect to the public Wi-Fi network at the shopping mall, the airport, etc. beware of the potential risk to your device because hackers love public Wi-Fi!
The most effective trick to staying safe on public Wi-Fi is to use a VPN on your devices. Although virtual private networks are not infallible, they can protect your privacy. They encrypt data that passes through the network and connect your device to a secure server, making it harder for the hackers on the same network or anyone who controls the…</span>

                    <span>These days whenever we post a URL (Uniform Resource Locator / Link) on any social media site, it will be converted to a short URL with that specific site&#x27;s domain in it.
This is ok, because the shortened URL will reduce the number of characters in the post and also when you look at a post with a long URL (more than 25 characters in it), it will no look good.
But, we often receive messages over WhatsApp or other social media websites, sometimes even as SMS on our phone with short URLs in them, asking us to visit that URL to claim a gift or something else.
The main problem here will be that most of these short URLs will be created by using services which are free and you really cannot tell where you will be redirected by clicking on it.
There are a few websites and services which will tell you what is behind a short URL and where you will be redirected once you click on it.
One such service is ExpandURL - Link
First go to ExpandURL and there you will see a page like this,

Paste the short URL (which u received as a message) in the input text field and click on Expand URL
The service will check the short URL and will give you results of it. The results will be shown like this,

Results will include,
the number of redirects made from the short URL to the expanded URL (long URL)
Available Meta description, and keywords
Content-Type 
Whether the link appears to be safe or not (Google Safe Browsing)
This is only a way to check where the user will be redirected after clicking on the short URL and whether the URL is appearing to be safe or not.
After confirming that the URL is safe and clicking on it, you should also check the content on that website.
Sometimes, the URLs (long URL) of the phishing websites will also appear to be safe, ultimately it is us who should decide whether you can stay on that site or should leave immediately.</span>

Shift cipher is nothing but substitution of letters to their left or right by some specific number of letters, and that number of letters will be known as the key of the cipher. Once the key is decided and the plaintext is encrypted to ciphertext, we can send the cipher text to whomever we want. If he/she will have the key, then he/she will easily decrypt the message and read it and can reply to that encrypting the message with the same key.

                    <span>If you are familiar with Angular, you might already know how to use ng update, ng add or ng generate. Every time you execute those commands, a so-called schematic gets executed.
Schematics are a great way to save developers hours of work on reading migration guides or copying boilerplate code from one place to another. On top of that, they are a great way to ship best practices.
So, how do we write our schematics now? Unfortunately, it is not yet as easy as you might think. You can create a blank schematics project like this:
npm install -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli
schematics blank hello-world

The schematics-cli creates a pre-configured project for you with a ready-to-use ng generate schematic. Everything from that point on needs to be done manually and leaves a lot of open question…</span>

                    <span>I recently joined a team working on an Angular project (more about that later) but also had to deal with trying to find a place to live. Yes, at the moment, I am a nomad who decided I would travel to different cities before I settle down somewhere later in the summer. 
I recently had that feeling of having worked placed so much effort in learning something and finally have the opportunity to use this newly acquired skill. In my case, I was finally getting the hang of using NGRX for state management on an angular application until I realized that all of the state in the application I was working on was using Services and RXJS 🤯. 
And because I very well understood how to use NGRX, it was compelling to see how others had implemented state management without the need for an external library. Needless to say, this was one place I needed to take a step back in order to be reminded that there&#x27;s always more than one way to tackle a hurdle or issue. 
As of now, I will have to delay my desire to have the ideal workstation, and learn how to develop in any space I environment as I travel to different places - and much of this will require a certain level of unlearning and establishing habits that help me become a better developer and person. I have taken to early morning runs/walks to break the monotony of my sun-light deprived room and bumped into this little gift:

                    <span>Fuzzy finder is one of the best tool which you can use for speeding up your daily terminal work flow. In my daily workflow, I have integrated fzf in most of the tasks where I have many choices and have to choose one among them, whether be it changing a git branch, searching and opening a file, changing directory or changing a project.
Let&#x27;s get started to exploit some features of fzf 😈
Probably your package manager already has it. If it doesn&#x27;t, don&#x27;t worry, just clone the git repo and run the install script as directed here.
You can check if the installation has been successful by running the command whereis fzf. You should see the location of binary.
Make sure to read the README.md from the project&#x27;s Github. It explains fzf and some of it&#x27;s usage quite well. Specially the key-binding pa…</span>

                    <span>🎩 Exploit Website Databases Using SQLmap 🎩
✨SQLmap is one of the most famous tools for SQL injection. It is pre-installed in Kali Linux so no need to download it from anywhere.
What is a SQL injection attack❓
✨SQLi is a common attack where the attacker injects and executes malicious SQL requests in order to get hold of the web databases. These attacks are common in vulnerable websites that use SQL RDBMS to store databases
So today we&#x27;ll perform an SQLi attack on a vulnerable website
✅ Requirements
⭕️Kali
⭕️Knowledge on Google Dorking
✅ Steps
⭕️ Google Dork vulnerable websites
First of all we have to get a vulnerable website to perform the attack. So we&#x27;ll use Google Dorking. In simple words, it means that using Google search engine, we can use some special codes in order to get some secu…</span>

                    <span>Whats a Fuzzer?


A fuzzer now-days is a automated testing tool to find security bugs. It does so by generating many inputs to be executed until on of them crashes the target program. In other words the objective is to crash a program, but how can we guide the fuzzer in the right direction? 
AFL added to the objective a notion of code coverage: Any input that reaches an area in the code that was unreachable before is interesting. Even if it did not crash the program we can mutate that input to get even more coverage, we call this feedback. Over the past years coverage had proved to be a great feedback mechanism, but collecting it was not simple if one did not own the source code of the target binary.
AFL originally used compile time instrumentation to insert assembly instructions at the be…</span>

                    <span>TLDR with no explaination
As an IT / cybersecurity student, I heavily relied on searching online for guides and forums to help me with my assignments. So this is me giving back to the community 😄
In this post I will explain how to exploit a vulnerability in an older version of a NodeJS library to enable RCE. Many concepts and technologies used will require an
intermmediate level of hands-on knowledge of cybersecurity
I will not explain every term. The entire process is quite simple. If you are unfamiliar with anything, try read it up. Everything mentioned is fairly common.
This Proof of Concept (POC) is a simple example of RCE. Good for demonstrating RCE to an audience without technical knowledge. I doubt it can be used in the wild for penetration testing or for any malicious purposes. In…</span>

                    <span>Trick is, use TWO password managers
First one is server-based BitWarden
Second one is file-based KeePassDX, with passphrase generator (actually, I tweaked this myself)
Then, use the passphrase generator in second password manager, BUT DON&#x27;t use it directly.
Instead, modify the passphrase, or make variations to your likings; so as to make more memorable and funny. (Then store all master password variations.)
I do have a question, though.
How long should MASTER password, that you type in (not copy) often, be?
Next step, is generating PINs, probably - this one is also highly reused.</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
