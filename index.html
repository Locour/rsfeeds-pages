                    <span>Inheritance remains one of the most relied upon and misunderstood features of JavaScript to this day. Since ES2015 JavaScript developers have been able to ignore how the inheritance sausage is made by relying on the class syntax that hides the nitty gritty details, until they run into its mind-bending edge cases.
In this post we&#x27;ll explore the secrets of JavaScript inheritance: [[Prototype]] and constructors.
But first, put your knowledge to the test:
console.log(&#x27;Overriding getters and setters&#x27;);

class SuperClass {
  _value &#x3D; undefined;
  get value() { return this._value; }
}
class SubClass extends SuperClass {
  set value(to) { this._value &#x3D; to; }
}
const sub &#x3D; new SubClass();
sub.value &#x3D; 5;

// What gets logged?

console.log(sub.value); // undefined

Runtime Templates Using String Identifiers
Many of the applications I develop for clients most often involve mathematical sciences, ranging from physics and engineering to financial modeling to data analytics. These applications regularly employ components in which the majority of the component’s runtime display is driven by external data. We are all familiar with using binding to alter some portion of a component. A fully data-driven component will also have other aspects of its display controlled by external data.
For example, it is common in the utility industry to display, analyze, and even edit load profiles. Each profile contains one or more time series such as ‘raw data,’ ‘cleansed data’, ‘gross’, ‘AMI’, etc. Each of these series has some meaning t…</span>

                    <span>Schematics in Angular provide a way to automate common tasks, such as generating files, reading, and updating configuration files, and modifying your codebase. Angular Schematics are built using the Angular Devkit, which consists of many lower-level APIs, along with a few concepts to learn such as the Virtual Filesystem, Trees, Rules, Actions, Context and more. Learning these concepts and APIs can be challenging for developers looking to write schematics for Angular applications and libraries.

                    <span>I’m a big fan of Angular, I’ve been using it for years now, for a variety of projects. I’ve written about it and helped others learn it. One thing that I have noticed that a lot of developers who start using Angular who have come from a different technology stack, is that they try to apply the style and approach they have in another framework or language to Angular. This can lead to extremely messy code or Angular code that is hard to maintain as a project grows.
The reason I feel this happens is Angular is an opinionated framework, there is an approach you take to write Angular apps. If you try to ‘build’ an Angular app in a way that goes against this approach, then things can start to go wrong.
In Angular there are some things you should do:

&quot;When should I use NgRx&quot; is a question whose answers have changed several times over the years, and personally I find a lot of the guidance available online to be a little too &quot;does it feel right&quot; and “can something else handle what you are doing”. While informative and a great way to learn about some new libraries, this is largely not helpful for deciding when to say “yes, I would benefit from using NgRx for this project”. Over the last several years I’ve tried to come up with a mental framework for deciding whether or not a project would benefit from NgRx, and decided to share what I’ve come up with and see what others think.
Obviously this is subjective and I would love to hear what others have to say and see what the community would add or remove to t…</span>

Using SSH tunnel we can connect the VM, before pls install VNC viewer in your local - https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/
From Local Machine
ssh -L localhost:5900:VM-IP:VNC-Port-Number username@hostmachine.com

For Example
HostMachine: dhanesh.vm-test.com (Public IP)
ssh -L localhost:5900:192.168.100.100:5912 dhanesh@dhanesh.vm-test.com

Finally open the VNC viewer and type localhost:5900 you can able to see the VM from your local machine. 
Ensure that all the Network settings are working fine.</span>

                    <span>What are Azure Roles and Custom Definitions?


When you start working more and more with Azure permissions you will undoubtedly have used Azure RBAC (also known as IAM) and have most likely used some of the great built-in roles that have been created and provided by Microsoft, but sometimes you may come across a requirement or a need to have a very specific role tailored with a set of permissions that are more granular than what comes out of the box in a standard Azure (RBAC) built-in role.
Luckily Azure offers a great deal of flexibility when it comes to defining your own custom roles vs built-in roles. This is where Custom Role Definitions comes into play.
Today we will look at how we can utilize Github actions in creating and also maintaining our Azure (RBAC) custom role definitions fro…</span>

Understanding of AWS CDK (Cloud development kit)
Understanding of AWS Custom resources
All through the blog I will be mentioning terms custom resource lambda and custom resource. Both terms look similar but actually are different. Custom resource lambda refers to the lambda that is responsible for implementing the logic. Custom resource is the resource itself that is created by invoking the custom resource lambda.
In this blog I am covering a niche scenario related to AWS custom resources when all your custom resource lambda needs is to call an AWS API. Usual use case of doing so would be when cloudformation does not support a resource and it is only available with an API.
For all other use cases, please refer to my earlier blog Custom Resources with AWS CDK.

                    <span>The high-availability features of MySQL InnoDB Cluster in its open source (Community) edition have come a long way, and in recent years the 8.x versions have delivered immense improvements in this area over the veteran 5.7 versions. I&#x27;ve found that monitoring such a cluster with OSS tools to be more involved, and through this post I hope to shed some light and share what has worked for me and my team.
TL;DR



8.x InnoDB Clusters (single Primary) are more tolerant to network failures (Auto Rejoin)

5.7.x InnoDB Clusters can also be managed using MySQL Shell from the 8.x series, although you will miss some of the newest management features (e.g. Clone)
Prometheus  and MySQL Exporter will enable you to monitor cluster members as reported in the replication_group_members table.

                    <span>Computer Vision(CV) is a field of Artificial Intelligence(AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs- and make recommended output based on that.


If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.
CV trains their machine to do such work but it should do those work in lesser time with the use of cameras or algorithms as compare to retina or nerves.
48.6 billion by 2022.



  
  
  How does Computer vision works?


Computer vision requires lots of data for getting good accuracy.
openCV 
There are many research has done in this field, but apart from it there are many uses of CV in business, entertainment, transportation, healthcare and everyday life.
Image Classification:
It sees an image and can classify it (a dog, an apple, a person’s face).
Object detection:
It can use image classification to identify a certain class of image and then detect and tabulate their appearance in an image or video.
Object Tracking:
It follows or tracks an object once it is detected. This task is executed by with image capturing in sequence or real-time.
Content-based image retrieval:
It uses computer vision to browse, search and retrieve images from large data stores, based on the content of the images rather than metadata tags associated with them.(PS:This is most useful application of CV)
You can check out my github repository where I have made many projects based on CV.

                    <span>For the last couple of years, I have been in the Linux space and mostly tried to find the best distro, best file manager, best terminal etc. I was caught up in the loop of finding the best programs to handle a job. This approach, unless controlled, usually leads to low productivity in the long term.
How so you might ask ? Well, this behavior is really relatable for some people. When I am talking about this subject, some of you might probably say, &quot;Oh yes I have been there&quot;. In Linux world, there is even a term for this. Ricing.
Ricing means tweaking the configuration of your working environment to suit your personal needs. At particular level, one might consider this useful, and it indeed is. There are some workflow approaches, shortcuts and others that helps the developer access files and folders faster, learn by muscle memory and perform some set of actions quicker. Past that particular level and you are now in the over-ricing zone. Where you are essentially tweaking every aspect of each program, work environment to your needs, but at the same time you are never satisfied so you keep tweaking and changing settings, configs and what not. It reduces your productivity and at the end of the day when you look back, you realize you have done nothing but tweaking some stuff to find the best work environment.
This is what I call the loop (referring to the Bandersnatch here). You are in the loop. You need to get out and you need to get sh*t done. Don&#x27;t worry about using the best tool out there, don&#x27;t try to find the absolute efficient program. Just get it done.
This is in actuality a paradox. The paradox goes as such, &quot;The more choices you have, the less satisfied you are&quot;. Seems about right when you think for a bit.</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using Ubuntu/Debian/Nitrux/Manjaro ARM as my main go-to OS&#x27; for several years now. I absolutely love being part of this vast community of great individuals.
&quot;Linux is difficult&quot; - &quot;Packaging is hard&quot; was once the most predominant ways for software companies to tell users, why they didn&#x27;t support Linux. 
But these days we got things like AppImages[1], which I think is very underappreciated within the community (just a feeling, no figures to back it up). Actually I&#x27;m unaware why AppImages aren&#x27;t already part of all Linux distros out there. I guess it&#x27;s because everyone is trying to roll their own distribution formats?
Anyway, An AppImage is a container format much akin to Mac Applications. You just download an AppImage from e.g. AppImageHub[2], set the execute permission on the file and off you go. No installation required - you can even place the AppImage file where ever you&#x27;d like. If you want to skip the &quot;set execute bit&quot; step and need tighter GUI integration there&#x27;s a daemon called appimaged[3] that you can run beforehand which will take care of all this.

Host Machine should have the Public and Private Network and VM should configured via bridge network from Privat network. 
Using SSH tunnel we can connect the VM, before pls install VNC viewer in your local - https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/
From Local Machine
ssh -L localhost:5900:VM-IP:VNC-Port-Number username@hostmachine.com

For Example
HostMachine: dhanesh.vm-test.com (Public IP)
ssh -L localhost:5900:192.168.100.100:5912 dhanesh@dhanesh.vm-test.com

Finally open the VNC viewer and type localhost:5900 you can able to see the VM from your local machine. 
Ensure that all the Network settings are working fine.</span>

                    <span>For a couple of days, I was looking for a simple terminal-based text editor for taking simple code notes or basic code fixing kinds of stuff.
As an aspiring developer, I really like the concept of coding without touching the mouse.
So I downloaded the king of CLI text editors, Vim.
Now, guess what happened.
Yeah, you&#x27;re right. I stuck inside vim and couldn&#x27;t even quit from there.
Then, I started watching a bunch of tutorials and started reading vim&#x27;s documentation.
This tutorial from Ben Awad helped me to get started.
But then I realized, I have to learn a lot of things only to operate vim and it&#x27;s a pretty lengthy process.
At that time, I really needed a very simple text editor for doing basic stuff.
But, vim is not simple... you know :)
So, I had to come back to &#x27;nano&#x27; &amp; I was not happy …</span>

                    <span>Hi, first of all I would like to tell you what IRC is, I will explain it in simple words so that even non-technical people can start playing with IRC.
Today I will describe how to start chat with IRC with my favorite IRC Weechat client, it&#x27;s a terminal client, but don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s very easy to configure and use on a daily basis, and if you have your own server you can even set it up in screen -S weechat :)
Shall we get started? Here we go!
First we need to install our new IRC client, there are many ways to install it, depending on which system you use.
pacman -S weechat and on macOS brew install weechat.

                    <span>Vim is a  text editor which is highly efficient. It is an improved variant of the vi editor, that is distributed with UNIX systems. 
Vim is often called a &quot;programmer&#x27;s editor,&quot; and so useful for programming that many consider it an entire IDE. It&#x27;s not just for programmers, though. Vim is perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing configuration files.
The vim text editor is an extremely powerful tool for developers, but it can be difficult to master.  If you are new to vim, I recommend these exercises
If you&#x27;re using a Mac or a Linux machine, it&#x27;s likely that your terminal has vim built in, so it&#x27;s worth being familiar with to work on those systems. 
If not, you can install vim with your package manager or test if vi is installed.
To install vim for Ubuntu, follow these instructions.
1: Open a terminal window and type sudo apt-get install vim
sudo apt-get install vim

2: If you want to get updated version of vim, open a terminal window and type sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get update

3: Then type sudo apt-get install vim
sudo apt-get install vim

The installation process will take some time, after which all the commands of vim will be available.

To start vim, just type vim in the command line
vim

Then you can type ESC followed by :e filename to open filename.
To open a vim directly from the command line, type:
vim filename

Press ZQ to quit vim without saving. Press ZZ to save and exit.
To move the cursor, you can press ESC and use the keys h,j,k,l.  You can also use the arrow keys in vim.

Vim has modes. To switch to writing mode, press the i key or the insert key. To switch to command mode, press the ESC key.
To save your file press ESC followed by :w.
Press :Explore to open the file explorer. Use the j and k keys and press enter to open the file. You can also use :LExplore</span>

                    <span>Learning Linux commands is one of those things that help you in your everyday life as a programmer, systems administrator or IT professional. So today I compiled a list of everyday linux commands that you might find useful in real life.
Linux is solid, but you don’t realize how much you depend on it until something goes wrong. Whether it’s a simple fix or you have no idea what’s going on. We’ll start with the basics:
ls : List contents of directory
$ ls
public_html

$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 owner group 0 Jan 23 13:09 index.html

$ ls -l /tmp/
total 616
drwxrwxrwt 27 root root 4096 Oct 22 14:09 .

cd : Change directory
user@hostname:~$ cd /etc
user@hostname:/etc

user@hostname:~$ cd /usr/local/bin
user@hostname:/usr/local/bin

pwd : Show current directory
user@hostname:/usr/local/bin$ pwd
/usr/local/bin
user@hostname:/usr/local/bin$ 

sudo : run command as root (admin)
$ sudo ls
[sudo] password for user: 

run a program
$ ./app

As a Linux user, you have more commands than you can count at the tip of your fingers.
In fact, you have enough commands to do every day tasks, including:
Using git version control for your project
Connecting to your web server over ssh
Controlling your file system
Searching for files containing a particular word in the file path
Backup databases or interact with them
See your web server logs for security attacks
Opening up a terminal-based text editor either locally or remotely
To get to a Linux pro level quickly, I recommend this tutorial</span>

*nix shell is a powerful tool that can help you go about your work easily. At the lowest level, it can be It can seamlessly run binaries and this power combined with shell grammar, you can write scripts to automate processes on your system.
Shell has this feature where you can define aliases to existing commands. So, if I alias w to wget, then every time I run w, it will be interpreted as wget.
Shell aliases can be easily defined by the following syntax:
alias &#x3D;&quot;some long command&quot;

So, for the above example, I can write
alias w&#x3D;&quot;wget&quot;

This line goes in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc depending on the shell you use. After adding an alias, you need to reload your shell config. This can be done simply by restarting your teminal, or if you don&#x27;t want to close the current ru…</span>

Example...
adrian@asus ~/www.apachefriends.org/xampp-files/7.4.8 $ chmod 755 xampp-linux-*-installer.run
click next next next next until the installation begins 
//commands to use 
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp/lampp start //to start the service
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp/lampp stop //to stop it
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp restart //to restart the service
sudo /opt/lampp/manager-linux-x64.run //to access control panel
****Instalacion HeidiSQL*****
You will see a window indicating that the program is being configured. We wait until it finishes, or until we see a window asking for permission to install dependencies. We click on the &quot;Install&quot; button of all of them so that the wizard takes care of downloading and copying everything necessary, and when the process is finished, and everything is ready on our PC, we will see the Wine configuration window. This window has 7 tabs, through which we will be able to configure the different aspects of this tool.Wine allows us to simulate all versions of Windows. This way, if we have software that can only run on a specific version of Windows, we will be able to load the libraries of that version, and impersonate the version of the operating system, for each of them. We can configure a default version, which will be used in all programs, and add specific EXE files to give each one a version. To verify that it has been installed correctly we will use
NOTE: before starting the Heidi server make sure you have your xampp servers running.

                    <span>Cloudinary is one of the tools/platforms that can be used to upload your images. In addition to being quick and simple to use, it also has exceptional documentation.
Obviously, in many cases, having a bucket at the cloud provider is at a better cost and perhaps more predictable. Because it is easier to deal with fixed prices or even estimates than with credits.
But sometimes we like to take advantage of free plan limits or we just don&#x27;t want to deal with infrastructure. We just want to deal with an SDK and upload the images.
It was precisely for this reason that I decided to write this article, to show that we can use the tools we use in our daily lives in a simple and effective way.

                    <span>Introduction


Usually we work on different version for our nodejs project and its hard to manage them,but fortunately there is tool called NVM(node verion manager) which help to manage your node version and switch between them according to your projects.


  
  
  Windows installation


Unfortunately nvm project is only for linux/macos, but...but there is another very similar project by Corey bulter,known as nvm-windows. Click this link  download the nvm-setup.zip file and install it in a mundane fashion as on windows.


  
  
  Linux installation


In your terminal use curl to install
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/v0.34.0/install.sh | 

after installation you need to add a bit of configuration in your .bashrc file or .zshrc etc. So, open the file and append the below code.
$ export NVM_DIR&#x3D;&quot;${XDG_CONFIG_HOME/:-$HOME/.}nvm&quot;
[ -s :$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh&quot; ] &amp;&amp; \. &quot;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh&quot;

This sets the path to directory of installation.



  
  
  usage


So let&#x27;s jump into the terminal and look at some of the commands.
To Install latest version of node




$ nvm install node

Install specific version




$ nvm install {node_verion}

#example
$ nvm install 10.0.0

command to list out all the versions installed




$ nvm ls

Switching between different node versions




# to use latest version
$ nvm use node  

# for a specific verion
$ nvm use 10.0.0  

Deleting node versions




$ nvm uninstall {node_version}

As this was an introductory post, we looked at some of the most used commands, this is a very useful tool if you are working on multiple projects which requires different version of node. You can have a look at the official nvm https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm gitrepo to understand thoroughly.

                    <span>If you are new here, then please visit our earlier article over here for some context. 
After the last article we were trying to find out ways to improve upon the approach but at the same time didn&#x27;t want to do anything crazy either. 
That is when we found out about Buddy. Buddy is one of those easy DIY devops tools out there. Best part is the UI and how easy it is to create a deployment pipeline. 
Okay so back to our task. We added this line in our package.json file under the build script.
    &quot;build&quot;: &quot;nest build &amp;&amp; mkdir -p build &amp;&amp; node obfuscate.js &amp;&amp; find ./build -name &#x27;*.ts&#x27; -type f -delete &amp;&amp; cp package.json build/&quot;,

The above line creates a folder called build, obfuscates(make it unreadable) and remove all the .ts files. We also had to copy our package.json file into the build folder so that we can install our dependencies at our destination.
Then we setup a pipeline in Buddy. 

We made 3 actions. Actions are more like a sequence of steps.  
The first one &quot;Execute&quot; created a build folder and obfuscated code.



The second one copied the build folder to the client&#x27;s server.



The third one basically started the project.





  
  
  Feel good moment


Once the actions were setup we started our pipeline and kept looking at this &quot;feels good&quot; UI while it was running.

After the pipeline completed, we logged into our server and were able to see our instance running. Phew!!! And this is how our code looks now. Not the best of encryption, but pretty hard to read/modify.

This solved our problem to a major extent. The only drawback we found was the speed of execution. It takes around 2-3 minutes for the entire process to complete. But we are sure there are ways to optimize it. So we are looking forward to it.
Let us know your comments.
Happy programming!!!</span>

plus DevOps developers. They need to be theoretically sound in just about all aspects of development and technology.

                    <span>Fidel makes it simple to add card-linking capabilities to any application. The process involves setting up a program, along with the participating brands and locations. And then registering or helping your users register their cards on the Fidel platform. Once they are live, Fidel receives transactions from participating locations and will pass them along to your application using webhooks. You can register your webhook URLs in the Fidel Dashboard and start receiving the transaction data.
There are two main steps in the process, and this tutorial is going to walk you through building an application with a card-linking feature.

The first requirement is to register user cards on the Fidel platform. Fidel provides SDKs to use within your applications to help you register cards simply and sec…</span>

                    <span>I started looking into Heroku as an option for creating personal applications in my free time. In fact, I converted an existing application from the AWS ecosystem to Heroku which was captured in a series on DZone.com:
Moving Away From AWS and Onto Heroku
Starting with a brand new idea with Heroku, I was able to quickly create a fitness-based SaaS solution as well, which was documented in another series on DZone.com:
Using Heroku to Quickly Build a Multi-Tenant SaaS Product
Well over a year into using Heroku for several of my applications, I thought I would take a step back and describe how Heroku works and offer thoughts on why the Salesforce-owned solution should be a consideration for your next project.

So, I have created this tool to help you embed your Twitter profile on your personal websites.


I have used the Node, Express at backedn and VanillaJS at frontend.
Here is the product URL: https://embed-twitter-profile.herokuapp.com/

                    <span>O que é o Event Emitter?


Event Emitter é um módulo do NodeJS que nos ajuda a criar um padrão de publisher-subscriber.
Com um Event Emitter podemos simplesmente criar um evento de qualquer parte de uma aplicação, escutar este evento e tomar alguma ação baseado nele.

Para criar um event emitter é preciso instanciar o EventEmitter do módulo events no NodeJS.
const { EventEmitter } &#x3D; require(&#x27;events&#x27;);

const eventEmitter &#x3D; new EventEmitter();

Esse é o básico para criar um event emitter. Mas o que podemos fazer com ele? 🤔
A classe do EventEmitter têm uma série de métodos e podemos usá-los para publicar e ouvir eventos. Por hora, focaremos em dois deles:
emit(eventName...)
on(eventName...)
Para publicar um evento nós utilizamos o método emit(). Já para ouvir, utilizamos o método on(). E a …</span>

                    <span>A brief and useful content about the mechanics on Cross-Origin Read Blocking, Cross-Origin Resource Policy and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing against Meltdown, Spectre and CSRF Attacks.
By design, Cross-Origin Read Blocking validates browser requests before they even reach the server using their MIME type as a validation rule.
To enable it, send the HTTP header X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff  from the server.
Cross-Origin Resource Policy is a complementary CORB mechanism for validation applied to requests flagged with no-cors to invalidate them if they came from different domains or origin.
Send the header Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy from the server with values same-origin or same-site to invalidate no-cors requests from different domains or origin.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a logical context mechanism that ensures minimal security in the way that users consume web content using browsers instructing how the browser will validate the origin of the requests.
To define rules about how the origin of the request will be identified, send the HTTP header Access-Control-Allow-Origin using values like  and even a more generic approaches using *.
Hope that now you understand a bit better why to use these Cross-Origin Resource features
Try don&#x27;t disable or ignore them in your web applications. Spectre, CSRF, and Meltdown attacks are really dangerous.

                    <span>Recently I start to explore the Azure SignalR Service for one of my chat based web wpplication.
Azure SignalR Service simplifies the process of adding real-time web functionality to applications over HTTP. This real-time functionality allows the service to push content updates to connected clients, such as a single page web or mobile application. As a result, clients are updated without the need to poll the server or submit new HTTP requests for updates.
To put more simple word Azure SignalR is a PaaS helps us to update the Client (UI) without refreshing the Page - So Cool😎 Is it?
For that I need to come-up with a architecture, So I start doing a POC - &quot;How to securely connect a Azure SignalR Service from a simple ChatBased Application&quot; ?

Blame Netflix or Spotify.
In fact, take your pick of any of the digital brands that have made seamless and beautiful UX a staple part of daily life. From one-click checkouts on Amazon to Single Sign-On across all of Google’s services, consumers have never had it better for digital experiences….and they are now expecting it everywhere they go online. 

Login boxes are the first thing many people engage with on a website. Yet, the importance of them can sometimes be relegated to “as long as it works, it works.”
The challenge is consumers don’t just want things that work; they want things that work so well they never even notice it. 
And so here are five ways in which your login box is turning your customers away from your brand.

                    <span>Storing sensitive values in Octopus Deploy solves many problems. If your organization has standardized on a secrets manager though, that might mean storing sensitive values twice, making secrets management more complicated.
Octopus has supported the concept of sensitive variables since Octopus 2.0, but customers often ask about support for secret managers. One in particular is HashiCorp Vault.
In this post, I walk through a number of new HashiCorp Vault step templates designed to retrieve secrets from Vault for use in your deployments or runbooks.

Runtime Templates Using String Identifiers
Many of the applications I develop for clients most often involve mathematical sciences, ranging from physics and engineering to financial modeling to data analytics. These applications regularly employ components in which the majority of the component’s runtime display is driven by external data. We are all familiar with using binding to alter some portion of a component. A fully data-driven component will also have other aspects of its display controlled by external data.
For example, it is common in the utility industry to display, analyze, and even edit load profiles. Each profile contains one or more time series such as ‘raw data,’ ‘cleansed data’, ‘gross’, ‘AMI’, etc. Each of these series has some meaning t…</span>

                    <span>React is awesome, right? It&#x27;s fast, lightweight and comes with a relatively simple API... at a cost. Up until recently React didn&#x27;t have a built-in solution for application state management. For many years Redux was a go-to library which solved that problem. But things have changed, React evolved and now we&#x27;ve got Hooks! One of them is especially interesting. Everyone, welcome useContext!
If you&#x27;re building a small web app, you might not need to use Redux for managing your application&#x27;s state, React already comes with Context and in this tutorial I&#x27;ll show you how to handle sitewide file uploads, so that you can freely navigate in your app without having to worry that that 1GB file which you&#x27;ve been uploading for the last half an hour suddenly stops and you&#x27;ll need to upload it again... an…</span>

                    <span>I recently developed plugins and, migrated all the utilities of DeckDeckGo to build these with esbuild.
If you are looking to do the same, hope this tutorial helps you get started!
esbuild is “an extremely fast JavaScript bundler” made by Evan Wallace. It is its tagline and, according my tests, the least we can say is that it is true. It is blazing fast ⚡️.
Sometimes while migrating my libraries, I even found myself waiting for the end of a build because I did not notice that it was already finished. I assumed it would still need some more time, old habits die hard I guess 😅.
In addition, other things which make me really like this new bundler are its clean, flexible API and, its documentation. It is easy to follow and, clear.
To get started, let’s create a new empty project.

                    <span>TLDR: Logical operators actually return one of the operands, so you can refactor code using this feature.
Usually, you may see || and &amp;&amp; logical operators in if cases.
if (case1 || case2) { 
  doSomething()
}

So you may expect that || and &amp;&amp; returns a boolean value, but it is only correct if values on both sides of these operators are boolean as well. 
Actually, these operators return one of their arguments. E.g. if they were functions they would be implemented like this.
function or(a, b) {
  if (a) {
    return a
  }
  return b
}

function and(a, b) {
  if (a) {
    return b
  }
  return a
}

It may sound and look a bit confusing, but let’s dive into examples.
let obj &#x3D; { prop: 1 }

// boring part
true || false // -&gt; true
false || true // -&gt; true
true &amp;&amp; false // -&gt; false
false &amp;&amp; true …</span>

                    <span>TypeScript is 🔥 - this seems to be a common understanding now in the frontend community. Many developers expect libraries to either be written in TypeScript, or at least provide good type definitions. For me, if a library is written in TypeScript, the type definitions are the best documentation there is. It&#x27;s never wrong because it directly reflects the implementation. I frequently look at type definitions before I read API docs.
React Query was initially written in JavaScript (v1), and was then re-written to TypeScript with v2. This means that right now, there is very good support for TypeScript consumers.
There are however a couple of &quot;gotchas&quot; when working with TypeScript due to how dynamic and unopinionated React Query is. Let&#x27;s go through them one by one to make your experience with …</span>

Before creating Ditsmod, of course, I was looking for: &quot;Are there ready-made solutions for my purposes?&quot;.
I believe that the set of the following features is unique at the moment:
The framework is written in TypeScript (and under the hood there is no ExpressJS or Fastify ;).
Modular architecture with decorators.
Has a hierarchical Dependency Injection that allows you to use classes as a search token, rather than their names.
Clearly delineated providers arrays for DI injectors at the application, module, route, or request level.
Built-in support for nested routes, such as /api/posts/:postId/comments/:commentId.
Check for collisions when importing providers. This feature allows you to detect situations where you import two or more modules that export providers…</span>

                    <span>As an Angular developer, one of my biggest challenges was shifting my thought process from mutable-, to immutable state.
In an Angular service, you can simply assign a new value to a property, and like magic - the change detection would kick in and update any component using the property. 
Switching over to React, suddenly immutable state is the way to go! Then, suddenly Redux - actions, reducers, middleware, dispatchers, and the list goes on. 
The first time I saw Redux toolkit, the very first thing that hit me, in Reducers:
...
reducers: {
    increment: state &#x3D;&gt; {
        state.value +&#x3D; 1;
    }
}
...

Assignment operator in a Reducer? For a brief moment I thought I somehow ended up in the Vuex documentation, this is how you update state in mutations. But No, it was Redux Toolkit.

What is Component?
Angular Application. It allows us to mark a logic class, and additional metadata for processing at runtime. Components have a template (in above code is &#x27;./app.component.html&#x27;) and only one component can be instantiated per an element in a template. 
NgModule. So you should declare it in a NgModule:

II. Angular Service
What is Angular Service?

Angular Service is an JavaScript function that&#x27;s responsible for doing a specific task. Using Services to exchange and processing data then keeps Components focused on doing business logic on the view.  So it&#x27;s very helpful to organize a big project that makes codes more clear and clean for development and reusability.

                    <span>My whole career up to this point has been built around designing and developing applications for offline or isolated networks and working with severely outdated operating systems with no external dependencies allowed. So when I moved into a new role working on cloud deployments, I took it as an opportunity to learn cloud development and deployments. It didn&#x27;t take me long to run into a bunch of headaches that comes with working on these platforms.
While searching for solutions and documentation on the various problems I&#x27;ve come across, I would often see references to OpenStack and it got my curiosity going. What is OpenStack? What services does it offer and who owns it? How do I learn to use it? What are it&#x27;s costs and limitations?

I had to also update the Team Explorer Everywhere (TEE/TEE-cli) that was embedded in that to the latest version. And upgrade java to version 11.   But once that was done, it works well.  Its a tad on the large size for an image.  (1gb), but it seems ok on its memory and CPU usage.  See the kubebox graph at the bottom.

                    <span>Feature what?


Feature flags or toggles are often* used in application code to allow for rapid integration of new changes without necessarily enabling them in production.
*I have no real idea how commonly used they really are
Feature flags can prevent the dreaded long running feature branch that keeps accumulating changes that you hold off from merging because you&#x27;re not ready for it to go into production in the next release.
These same challenges can apply to your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) where having changes to shared resources you want to test in a lower environment but aren&#x27;t ready to promote to production can be a real problem.
Consider this scenario:
You&#x27;re making changes to your network in a cloud environment.
You&#x27;ve got your changes in a development environment and everything …</span>

                    <span>Motivation to create Ditsmod


Before creating Ditsmod, of course, I was looking for: &quot;Are there ready-made solutions for my purposes?&quot;.
I believe that the set of the following features is unique at the moment:
The framework is written in TypeScript (and under the hood there is no ExpressJS or Fastify ;).
Modular architecture with decorators.
Has a hierarchical Dependency Injection that allows you to use classes as a search token, rather than their names.
Clearly delineated providers arrays for DI injectors at the application, module, route, or request level.
Built-in support for nested routes, such as /api/posts/:postId/comments/:commentId.
Check for collisions when importing providers. This feature allows you to detect situations where you import two or more modules that export providers…</span>

Currently, we are storing the configuration for our application externally, in environmental variables. This is beneficial, because it allows us to change our app configuration without changing any of the code in our codebase.
However, we want to ensure that all of the environmental variables needed for our app to run are set when our app starts. Otherwise, our app might start initially, then crash due to an error when a variable is unexpectedly undefined.
It would also be nice to export a single config object that we can use throughout our application, instead of having to reference process.env.VARIABLE_NAME…</span>

Se você não tem paciência e muito menos vontade de aprender coisas novas, o VIM não é feito para você.Não é uma crítica, mas uma verdade.
A primeira coisa que você vai precisar aprender para usar o VIM é entender que tudo se baseia em uso de teclado e seu fluxo de trabalho é diferente, pois, não é simplesmente abrir e sair escrevendo código.

ESC, para retornar ao modo NORMAL e em seguida pressione a combinação de teclas :w nomedoarquivo.ts. O comando :w vai salvar o arquivo. Para sair do VIM, só pressionar a combinação :q.

I have read a lot of exciting, helpful and inspiring articles/posts on dev.to and have felt like giving something back for a long time. Additionally a colleague of mine have been pushing me to writing a blog post for a long time (thank you, Jonathan) so I thought this fuck up and how it was solved, might as well be helpful, interesting and inspiring for others.
Please don&#x27;t hesitate to give any kind of feedback for my first post!
As the title indicates, I committed and pushed a secret to git. I had to run some code locally relying on this secret and as I were eager to resolve the problem I was working on, I eventually forgot all about the secret.... So I staged the file files, wrote a commit message, committed them and pushed it all to GitHub, including the secret and boom! …</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s generally accepted that we should never simply trust a user&#x27;s input. Otherwise, we&#x27;re vulnerable to malicious input (CE-5). For a file upload from a user, it’s common to check their file size or type, especially when restricting them by those two attributes. But one that might get overlooked is the filename.
Checking the filename is especially important when it displayed on a web page to prevent HTML or XSS injection. That’s just on the frontend. On the backend, there are the other usual injections to worry about. Like SQL injection, when storing the name in a database. Or path injection, if storing in a path based on the name.
It might be tempting to dismiss this possibility as something that would never happen. After all, we must make the files first before we can upload them and th…</span>
