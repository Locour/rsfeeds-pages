                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to understand the Angular terms and philosophy. One of the most basic building blocks of Angular seems to be a directive.
The Angular glossary says that &quot;A [directive is a] class that can modify the structure of the DOM or modify attributes in the DOM and component data model&quot;.
Seems VueJS also has the concept of directive.
directive is some special token in the markup that tells the library to do something to a DOM element.&quot;
This includes a reference to the AngularJS framework, and, yes, it seems AngularJS also has this term.
AngularJS docs:  &quot;At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS&#x27;s HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children.&quot;
Ok, so it seems that the term originally comes from AngularJS, and Angular and VueJS just inherited it.
I guess, in Layman terms, a directive is a way of &quot;teaching the HTML to do new tricks&quot; (not mine). 
directive?
Still not sure, maybe the creators thought of this term because a directive it&#x27;s like commanding (giving directives/instructions/orders) to a static technology (HTML) in order to make it smarter.</span>

Today, I&#x27;ll be talking about which is better: React or Angular. Feel free to share your opinions in the comments below!
Let&#x27;s get it!

 ‚ú® Javascript is one of the most popular languages ‚Äã‚Äãamong developers today. There are many developers, newbies, and *seasoned aficionados* who build their application or project using Javascript, but still, there is confusion when choosing the right framework or library for their design. ‚ú® 

Soooo Angular and React are both popular but developers can&#x27;t really decide upon WHICH is good for their project. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Most learners and students want to learn a framework that could help in getting them a good job in the market. ü§ì
Alright I honestly think I&#x27;m wasting your time lets get to the point. üòÇ

Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code technology and it is used to create immutable infrastructure. It allows infrastructure to be expressed as code in a simple, human readable language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). 
Deliver infrastructure as code with Terraform using declarative .tf configuration files.
Plan and predict changes: Terraform provides an elegant user experience for operators to safely and predictably make changes to infrastructure. It reads configuration files and provides an execution plan of changes, which can be reviewed for safety and then applied and provisioned.
Extensible providers allow Terraform to manage a broad range of resources, including IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and hardware services.

Launch two instances in different regions( us-east-1 and us-west-1)
Create a volume in the first region (us-east-1)
Go to EC2, under Elastic Block Store (left pane), and click on Volumes
Create volume. The size of this volume would be 10 GB
Once it is successfully created, you will see its state set to available 



Now right on newly created volume and select ‚Äòattach volume‚Äô

                    <span>I have been using MySQL for the last 3 years. In the beginning, the data size was small and manageable.
The problem started occurring when one of our tables grew to a size of 15 GB.
But 15 GB is nothing for MySQL, right? That‚Äôs what we thought.
Digging deeper we found that our index size was also 15GB. This can be solved if keep on increasing the database systems‚Äô size and upgrade it.
To remove indexes, MySQL has drop index available with multiple options like
algorithm_option:
    ALGORITHM [&#x3D;] {DEFAULT | INPLACE | COPY}

lock_option:
    LOCK [&#x3D;] {DEFAULT | NONE | SHARED | EXCLUSIVE}

There are still things we need to consider before running this, like what will happen if the table is heavily used and updated very frequently.
Create New table
Copy data to the new table
Create procedures for inserts/updates in the original table
Drop index ( or any heavy operation, like optimize table )
Rename the table back to original
Drop old table
Drop procedures
Those are a lot of things. Wish we had a tool for this, so we could just automate it.
Percona Toolkit by Percona
More specifically for this change, we need pt-online-schema-change https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/LATEST/pt-online-schema-change.html
pt-online-schema-change --alter&#x3D;&quot;ADD INDEX big_table_name (some_column_name)&quot; \ 
--analyze-before-swap --recursion-method&#x3D;none D&#x3D;db_name,t&#x3D;big_table_name,h&#x3D;hostname,\
u&#x3D;user_name --ask-pass --preserve-triggers --execute

Above is a simple add index operation. Even if the table is big, in the options we can specify how much CPU should be maintained. How many resources could be consumed by this utility.
What if you had replicas, and the lag becomes higher than usual. We can skip checks for them to avoid interruption.

So every now and then i see something that catches my eye. Recently that seems to be Linux Distributions, over the last few months i have changed my distribution&#x27;s a few times to try and find one i&#x27;m comfortable with. I moved from my iMac (getting a bit sluggish) to Ubuntu originally and it worked but i didn&#x27;t &quot;enjoy it&quot;, i then tried Manjaro, then Pop!_OS and then finally thought id have a go with Elementary OS.
So far i am really enjoying it! it feels a bit &quot;Mac&#x27;ish&quot;, Looks nice and feels quick!
But compared to Ubuntu its a little bit different with the Setup of the dev environment, so i thought id write up a little tutorial on setting a Laravel Dev Environment on Elementary OS.
So as with any tutorial i do with Linux, we start with an update/upgrade.

One of the more common practices in software projects is to keep certain information separated but accessible from the codebase which uses it. This is usually done with secrets such as passwords or private keys, but is also commonly done with user or context-specific info pieces. However, management of environment variables can be confusing. The solutions to deal with it are many, and there are even built-in ones such as bash_profile. 
direnv, a shell extension which enables the definition of a list of environment variables scoped by a directory. After installing &amp; hooking the extension, direnv will execute every time you change directories, looking for an .envrc file in the same or in a superior directory tree level. It will then load the defined variables to the current en‚Ä¶</span>

  Development on Linux


I switched to Linux last year and shifted my development completely to the Linux ecosystem. Tried out arch, Manjaro, Pop OS!, Ubuntu, MX Linux. Development is really productive with a Linux environment.
A few months back I upgraded my potato to a gaming laptop which of course came with Windows pre-installed, I also started gaming. I ended up doing dual boot to run Ubuntu as my daily driver for development, but this eventually meant a redundant set of tools on Windows as well.
Windows released the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 in May 2019. WSL 1 was a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables on Windows. WSL2 built on top is built on the core technology of Hyper-V to provide better support and improved perf‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Node.JS is a technology that has transformed JavaScript, which is familiar to all web developers, from a client-side scripting language to a general-purpose language that has a large number of application use cases.
 
At the heart of how Node works.js is asynchronous. In addition to non-blocking I / O, this allows a server-side application on Node.js can handle much more client requests per unit of time than a similar application developed on most other server-side development technologies.
What does this mean for your business?
You can start your own project with relatively low costs for the server infrastructure.
With the right architecture, this allows you to scale your business without investing a lot of money.

There are many pages wich explain what the Spread Operator (also know as three dots) and Rest Parameters are. 
It is an operator that I really like and I would like to share with you some ways that I use it.
üìì Spread Operator
let numbers &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log( numbers );

// &#x3D;&gt; [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] (print as array)

When we use the spread operator we get the values ‚Äã‚Äãindependently:
let numbers &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log( ...numbers );

// &#x3D;&gt; 1 2 3 4

Add an array to another:
let customers &#x3D; [ &#x27;Claudia&#x27;, &#x27;Borja&#x27;, &#x27;May&#x27; ];
let otherCustomers &#x3D; [ &#x27;Sergio&#x27;, &#x27;Jose&#x27; ];

customers.push( ...otherCustomers );
console.log( customers );

// &#x3D;&gt; [ &#x27;Claudia&#x27;, &#x27;Borja&#x27;, &#x27;May&#x27;, &#x27;Sergio&#x27;, &#x27;Jose&#x27; ]

Node.js is not a Framework or Programming Language but a runtime environment built on top of Chrome&#x27;s V8 engine to execute JavaScript outside of the browser, SIMPLE!
I often read articles where the author mentions Node.js as a JavaScript Framework and even compares it with PHP Frameworks, Ruby Frameworks, C# Frameworks, and also with JavaScript frontend frameworks and libraries like Angular, React, and jQuery.
Kindly stop this and don&#x27;t misguide the people as this is really confusing for beginners who are trying to understand what Node.js is under the hood as Node.js has a lot to offer than just a Web Framework or JavaScript library.

I don&#x27;t know if I haven&#x27;t said it enough yet, but most of the functional programming concepts are inspired from mathematical concepts, probably that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re hard to grasp :&quot;
So what&#x27;s about this word &quot;closure&quot; and what makes this very concept so special that I talk about?
Well let&#x27;s first inspect the mathematical concept itself and maybe we can make a projection on typescript/javascript.
In mathematics, a set is closed under an operation if performing that operation on members of the set always produces a member of that set.
Yeah sure.. set? member? totally understandable yeh.

We needed three key things that fall outside of the Unity stack:
A website to host a free preview version of the game (https://wabbitsworld.com)
A service on that site that can share photos to Facebook that are uploaded from the game, even if from a mobile app etc

Basically I&#x27;m really excited about writing packages. I just created this small tool called bring-me! This basic cli tool just brings you libraries to your current working directory directly from its cdn! You can also add libraries to the repertoir of libraries you have saved for downloading later!
bring-me lib jquery -d /public/js you will have jquery already integrated in your project!
 / 
        bring-me
      
    
 
NPM CLI tool for delivering common front-end libraries, frameworks, stylesheets, etc. for lightweight and easy development without needing them stored in node_modules or when internet connection could be a problem in the future.
Install globally with NPM
npm install -g @devasolutions/bring-me
Or install in development
npm install --save-dev @devasolutions/bring-me
Bring-me is a CLI tool used to download popular frameworks from there CDNs so that you can use them offline when needed in mostly Front-End Development scenerios
Summary:
Bring-me scans a bmconfig.json file inside the module&#x27;s directory to get the most popular frameworks and libraries (bootstrap,bulma,jquery,lodash,phaser at the moment).
bmconfig.json example:
[
  {
    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.js&quot;,

The wildcard (*) in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is the primary change in this refactor work. It is time to restrict the origin to the hosting server (ID.ext-twitch.tv) of the Twitch extension.
Another change that should not add extra scope, is to remove DELETE from the Access-Control-Allow-Methods header.

Electron.JS, in its main purpose - is for creating desktop applications using Javascript. Most popular way of doing so is using React &amp; Node.js.
I will introduce a code architecture for building scalable Electron application - and on the fly - compile the code on chosen OS platform.
I am not going to focus on implementing it with an Electron application because there is no need for this tutorial, but you should know that the best application of this tutorial resides in Electron applications.
We are going to code the application to both Darwin and Windows platforms in one workspace - but as we&#x27;ll see, in compilation we will be compiling only one (chosen by us) platform code. Because in most cases, you will need to code a code for 2 (at-least) platforms. But, we of-course don&#x27;t want ‚Ä¶</span>

tl;dr
https://github.com/yugely/smooth_crawl]
I am currently building out my project for a deno/rust search engine with mellisearch. I needed a web crawler. I built 5 different prototypes, so I am now writing out the guide to make the one I made. 
Since this is a deno backend, I&#x27;m taking advantage of the ability to use typescript OOB. Its handy, especially with the ability to create interfaces that can extend others.
What should a web crawler do?
Crawl to a depth blindly
Be rate limited in the calling
Crawl unique links
Parse URLs
Handle edge cases
We are going to make one that does all of those.

We previously discussed the required folder structure for the posts service, to have a complete backend we will need some authentication also, we need the user model who will be the owner of the post. I don&#x27;t want this article to go long, So I will cut corners on the parts that I have covered previously.

See full example on repo: vue-ts-eslint-template.
Use the repo create-vue to get started, this will be the official way to set up a new Vue project with Vite in the future. After running npm init vue@next choose the options appropriate for your use case.
The first step is to enable the Volar extension and disable the Vetur extension.
If you chose the Typescript option offered by the CLI tool you should be good to go.
If you run into some issues regarding types try adding the following to your tsconfig.json
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
    ...
    &quot;types&quot;: [&quot;vite/cli&quot;], // add this
  }
}

You will need several packages, run the commands below in your terminal:

npm i -D eslint eslint-plugin-vue eslint-config-prettier

Typescript:

1) With angular 13 now its Ivy everywhere but we have Ivy from angular 9 (by default) so what is new here.
2) For Library authors earlier it is recommended to use enableIvy: false which now not doable as we have no Ivy but we have other option compilationMode: &quot;partial&quot; so they both are same?
3) If a new library is published with angular version 13. then can it be consumed in an application which is non-ivy?
4) Everywhere we have benefits of Angular 13 but in practical what will be disadvantages for already developed applications</span>

                    <span>How to create sticky columns in Angular using directives. Implementing tables with sticky columns can be tricky especially when you have to make multiple columns sticky. Using directives, we can easily implement sticky columns.
I can&#x27;t emphasize more the power of directives in Angular. I&#x27;ve written a couple of articles showcasing how one can actually use it to implement really cool stuff. You can check some use-cases for directives here:  Angular Directive Showcase.

We make use of the position: sticky CSS property to make an element sticky. Read more about sticky positioning at  MDN.
.sticky {
  position: sticky;
  left: 0;
}

For the sticky position to work properly, at least one of top, right, bottom, or left should be specified.
Making the first column in a table sticky is super simple‚Ä¶</span>

InterSystems IRIS 2019 is going to introduce new and¬†exciting features. One of the areas with new interesting must-to-know things is the API Management.¬†
OpenAPI initiative (https://www.openapis.org/) is the organization supporting a standard specification to define APIs (https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification). The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Simila‚Ä¶</span>

Nx leans for some, but not for all packages from this project. It does not use the builder to execute ESLint.
The following packages are included in your project.
@angular-eslint/builder:This package is used to execute ESLint in your project using standard commands such as ng lint.
@angular-eslint/eslint-plugin: This is the ESLint specific package that contains some specific rules that are specific for the Angular projects. It can be combined with other ESLint packages.

Open edX is an open-source platform you can use to create and host online courses. It was originally developed in 2012 by MIT and Harvard University and has since been adopted by organizations of all shapes and sizes to power a wide range of online learning use cases.
We use Ansible to provision and maintain our platform. If you are not familiar with Ansible, it&#x27;s an open source Devops tool that automates the software provisioning and configuration. It building blocks are:
Ansible Playbooks which has 1 or multiple roles. Imaging Playbook as full instructions on how to install your software, it&#x27;s components and how the set them up to work properly.

                    <span>Sometimes coverage badge is not updating at all and remains at the same value as it was in the past.
If you search in your setup of Gitlab and find a ¬´blocked¬ª pipeline ‚Äî exactly this type of pipeline is the main reason for coverage score staling.
my-job:
    when: manual

To fix this you need to add only one line:
my-job:
    when: manual
    allow_failure: true

And poof, you get lucky, your coverage badge is free of the evil witch curse and updates as it should.
Recently Gitlab guys fixed that behavior. How exactly? Just added default value allow_failure: true for manual pipelines automatically. This is a very good decision, because otherwise, a single manual step may ruin the whole CI/CD prosperity of your project.
my-job:
    when: manual
    allow_failure: false

and poof once again ‚Äî you are stuck with never-ever updating coverage badge. The fix is obvious ‚Äî add ¬´true¬ª for allow_failure or strip this line. But I have no answer to a simple question: what we should do if we need manual pipelines with disabled failure option and updatable coverage badge? Probably, this question should be addressed directly to Gitlab.
This may not be so easy to grasp from official documentation, so I decided to write this article. I hope it helped.</span>

Containers are not a fad. They‚Äôre never overkill for any project and they simplify many aspects of development, even when running locally. With a wide selection of relevant tools and resources, there has never been a better time than now to implement containers in your organization and get ahead of the curve.
What Are Containers?
Aren‚Äôt Containers Just For Larger Organizations?
What Can I Use Containers For?
Benefits Of Containerization
Since containers are designed to run alongside other containers, you can work on smaller aspects and microservices of a project while holding other containers constant. This also makes it easy to test a project with varying combinations of containers.

                    <span>H√° alguns dias atr√°s precisei criar ou recriar um ambiente PHP semelhante ao ambiente de produ√ß√£o, em produ√ß√£o era utilizado o PHP na vers√£o 7.2, com o Nginx na vers√£o 1.14.0 e tamb√©m o PHP-FPM que √© o cara respons√°vel por interpretar o c√≥digo PHP j√° que o Nginx n√£o consegue fazer isso, mais isso tudo diretamente pelo sistema usando unix sockets, tudo instalado diretamente no sistema. 
Por√©m tive algumas dificuldades para criar o ambiente usando o fastcgi e ent√£o resolvi escrever este artigo para ajudar outras pessoas que venham a precisar e tamb√©m para o meu eu do futuro que pode vir a precisar fazer algo semelhante.

This got me thinking... is Linux better for development? 
Do you use Linux for development? What do you develop? How has the experience been for you? What is your best advice for someone to get into developing in Linux? Are there distros to try out? Are there distros to avoid? Why did you move to Linux from MacOS or Windows?
I welcome all comments, questions, and suggestions! I may even turn this into a series where I try out Linux and report my findings.</span>

Now you realize I need to navigate to a directory inside another directory that is inside another. The chain continues for about 4-5 directories until you reach the required folder.
Such a mood spoiler, right! This potential move has the tendency to force you to get up from your desk and take a 5-minute break which can very quickly turn into a long break. 
See, the damaging domino effect it can have? Now you will argue, ah! You don&#x27;t know, I can keep pressing the &quot;up&quot; arrow and find the command I need because I used it just about a few hours ago. 
But is that the most efficient way or the best we can do?

                    <span>We can convert a specific container into a base Docker image, but that&#x27;s not the recommended way to create images because these could include useless cached or session data. 
Dockerfile.
üß† Remember that a Docker image has a read-only filesystem based on layers which works as a template to start containers in a preinstalled environment, and a Docker container uses this &quot;template&quot; to run isolated applications into a virtualized run-time environment with a normal filesystem.
No, you can run commands with other users using the Dockerfile as well. You can see an example here.
When you are testing a random software within a container you might need to publish a port on the host OS, or into another computer. In this case you can&#x27;t add a forwarding port rule to an already existing container, so here is when docker commit comes to save us:
$ docker commit my_container my_image
$ docker run -p 8080:80 -it my_image

Now we can access to the port 80 in the container using http://localhost:8080 in the host OS.
docker commit can also be used to attach new volumes to the container.
Remember that it&#x27;s a good practice to keep your Docker images as minimalist as possible. Also the reproducible way to create and ship images is the Dockerfile.
üí° You can inspect the layers of a Docker image using Dive, to optimize the size of your images.</span>

                    <span>I am an IT student with diploma in computer engineering and currently perusing my bachelors, I have been using windows from the day i saw a computer for the first time in my life.
i was a windows user for 11 years, recently switched to Linux Mint..
The Good.
the way WIFI connects within seconds contrary to windows make me literally drool.
like some times my laptop would be in sleep the whole night and as soon at i wake it in the morning it already would be connected to the WIFI
on the contrary windows takes 69 years to connect
software installation process with terminal was super straight forward, i loved it.
your imagination is the limit when it comes to customization
UI is ‚ù§Ô∏èüò© (or maybe windows UI is just too shitty)
The Bad
No Photoshop, No Office, No Vegas Pro
yes there are alternatives, like libreoffice, Gimph..
i hate them, they suck.
libreoffice works but best of luck with the formatting of files your friend sent you
random freezes, my laptop used to just freeze, nothing worked... tried everything under the sun to recover from this stuck phase and preventing it, even mad it to mint forums, nothing... only solution once there was to hard reboot.
poor software updates, third party software updates matter because the come baring bug fixes, third party software like slack, quickdock, even whatsaap for desktop, all plagued with bugs.
this one is not that significant but the booting time in Linux was a bit higher than the windows counterpart, not that noticeable in the long run but coming from windows immediately it caught my attention.
anywho, i came back into loving arms of windows in about two months into my Linux journey, do i regret it, No.
would i install Linux again, No.
do i feel line one os is superior than other, No.</span>

                    <span>Today I will show you how to install Docker in Linux Mint and Ubuntu. Docker is a very useful tool which every developer should know. Using Docker you can run many applications with special containers. They are beside your system. For instance you code in php and you need php in your system to run application. With Docker you can install and run many versions of php. Let‚Äôs start!
First of all we should update the package lists:
sudo apt-get update

Next we have to install dependencies:
sudo apt-get -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

Perhaps you have installed all dependencies. After installing dependencies we have to add GPG key:
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

and repository:
sudo add-apt-repository &quot;deb [arch&#x3D;amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release; echo &quot;$UBUNTU_CODENAME&quot;) stable&quot;

When we add a new repository we have to remember to update package lists. So one more time we run sudo apt-get update .
Then we can install Docker in Linux Mint and Ubuntu (we install also docker-compose):
sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose

After installing Docker we have to add our user to a docker group:
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

It is necessary in order to run Docker without root privileges (without sudo). In my opinion running Docker with sudo is not a good idea. Remember restart machine after adding your user to group!
We can check our installation:
docker -v
docker-compose -v
docker run hello world

You should see the version of docker and docker-compose.

I wrote a shell script which install Docker in Linux Mint and Ubuntu automatically:
You can get it on my GitHub.
You can see tutorial on YouTube.</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s five years of introducing myself as a Debian user in the OS world. But I have full respect for Windows as well. Well, my dad uses Windows, but that&#x27;s not the reason you should hate Windows OS.
Microsoft Windows is with us from the start of OS development, from 1985. But this is also not the reason you shouldn&#x27;t hate Windows.
The only reason I am stuck on Linux/Debian OS is that it is good enough to fulfil my requirements. Similarly, many people are stuck in Windows because it is good enough to fulfil their requirements. 
Well, one of my college friends tried Linux, he search for a piece of software to do some writing stuff, he got LibreOffice, and tried it. FOR HIM, LibreOffice wasn&#x27;t good enough. I told him to use Google Docs as well, but at the end of the day, it didn&#x27;t match with him.
Also, he was a Valorant player friend. He search how to install Valorant in Linux? And guess what, he got disappointed, Valorant isn&#x27;t playable in Linux, aka: BANNED
So, we need to keep in mind that if something fulfils our requirement why one should change he/her workflow.
In a nutshell, we all want our tasks to be accomplished as soon as possible. If something we currently own and does the task we want without any issue, we&#x27;re good to go with it.

Reactive programming provides advanced data flows with the ability to create and manipulate event streams in a predictable manner.
This article will teach Node.js developers how to apply reactive programming in Node as well as its benefits and trade-offs.
The following will be covered in this article:
 Fundamentals of reactive programming
 Why consider reactive programming in Node.js?
 When to use the reactive programming approach
 Benefits of reactive programming
 Drawbacks of reactive programming
 Introducing orchestration and its benefits/trade-offs
 Reactive programming libraries for Node
In simplified terms, a program is said to be reactive when an input change leads to a corresponding change in output without any need to update the output change manually. ‚Ä¶</span>

Schema
A description of the shape a unit of data should undertake. So for a house isn&#x27;t the data, but a description of what the data of a house should look like.

const mongoose &#x3D; require(&quot;mongoose&quot;)

const houseSchema &#x3D; new mongoose.Schema({
    street: String,
    city: String,
    state: String,
    zip: String
})


Schema
If we want to manage a collection of documents (a bunch of items) of this datatype we then declare a model. This creates a collection and becomes the conduit to add, update, delete and retrieve data from the collection.
const House &#x3D; mongoose.model(&quot;House&quot;, houseSchema)

// query for all houses
House.find({})

When you&#x27;re adding authorization to an application, there are two crucial questions:
Are users that shouldn&#x27;t have access actually out?
Are users that should have access actually in?
If you can&#x27;t answer with certainty both questions, how can you claim to have a secure application? This is something that you can test manually, but a better alternative is test automation. Concretely, I think the best methodology to get there is using Test-Driven Development (TDD).
This piece is about adding authorization to a Ruby on Rails API by following TDD. You can check out this article to learn in detail how to secure a Rails API with Auth0. Also, you can follow this article along with this repository.

                    <span>The global influx of digital transformation is creating pressure on infrastructure. All the while, threat actors are continually improving their attack techniques. If there is a vulnerability to be found, it will be exploited. 
This is why many teams are shifting security to the left, even going as far as evolving their dev methodology from DevOps to DevSecOps.
Developers still have remaining concerns, most of which focus on release time. However, you should not have to compromise fast releases in favor of security. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a question of either/or.

                    <span>THE EXPERIMENT: JAVASCRIPT SOURCE CODE SECURITY TESTING TOOLS


To begin our experiment, we chose 1,000 Javascript projects on GitHub that were recently updated and had between 50 and 200 stars in rating. Next, we went to UpWork.com and paid non-professionals ¬£5/hour to use the Uleska Platform to automatically run three Javascript source code security testing tools. We consolidated the results generated by the platform to the project teams and made sure they didn‚Äôt have security or programming skills.
We didn‚Äôt set up any of our cyber value-at-risk enumerations, as they would apply to how an open-source library is used within the end-user application (i.e. types of data processed, quantity of data, environment etc.).
We also made the decision not to triage the results, as the Uleska Platfo‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>(caption: Mrs. Tedesco writing a Todo Application in React with hooks)
It happens when we write useEffect hooks. We intend to just run some code when X changes, but then ESLint tells us to add Y and Z to the dependency list.
useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  setCount(count + 1)
  // eslint-disable-next-line
}, [])

Ignoring this rule is very bad. It opens up our code to a class of weird bugs (ex: count gets a value from the past). But most importantly, it hides bad design in other parts of the component.
I can strongly claim that EVERY useEffect can be made compliant with the ESLint rule while still mantaining the desired behavior. The solutions might not be straightforward, but it is always better to change other parts of the code than to add the rule. The overal benefit will be more consistent code.

                    <span>How to create sticky columns in Angular using directives. Implementing tables with sticky columns can be tricky especially when you have to make multiple columns sticky. Using directives, we can easily implement sticky columns.
I can&#x27;t emphasize more the power of directives in Angular. I&#x27;ve written a couple of articles showcasing how one can actually use it to implement really cool stuff. You can check some use-cases for directives here:  Angular Directive Showcase.

We make use of the position: sticky CSS property to make an element sticky. Read more about sticky positioning at  MDN.
.sticky {
  position: sticky;
  left: 0;
}

For the sticky position to work properly, at least one of top, right, bottom, or left should be specified.
Making the first column in a table sticky is super simple‚Ä¶</span>

Now that we are slowly merging the first parts of this migration we would love to share some insights into why we didn&#x27;t just go with TypeScript in the first place and why we have decided that the time was right now.
Before working full-time on Medusa we did agency work for a handful of different e-commerce clients; one of them wanted to migrate away from their solution back then and when we couldn&#x27;t find a new suitable platform for them we agreed to build a custom solution from scratch.

                    <span>A JavaScript superset, that builds up on JavaScript language, It adds new features to JavaScript, typescript cant run in the browser or even in NodeJS therefore it has a compiler that  compiles typescript to JavaScript. Added features in typescript include the use of types, it also helps us be more explicit and clearer about our code.
Lets look at two code snippets one with Plain Javascript and another in typescript .
Plain Javascript
  let inputA &#x3D; 1
  let inputB &#x3D; 2
  function sum(inputA, inputB){
     console.log(inputA + inputB)
  }
  sum(inputA,inputB)
  //this will return 3
  //Now what if we change the inputs to be
  inputA &#x3D; &quot;1&quot;
  inputB &#x3D; &quot;2&quot;
  sum(inputA,inputB)
 //this will return 12

Despite the second answer being wrong, we dont get an error notification at run time. Here is when typescript comes in with its additional type feature that guarantees we get the correct answer or an error.In typescript this would be written as(you can test this code in the TS playground):
    let inputA &#x3D; 1
    let inputB &#x3D; 2
    funtion sum(inputA: number,inputB: number){
     console.log(inputA + inputB)
    }
    sum(inputA,inputB)
    //prints 3
    //Now what if we change the inputs to be
    inputA &#x3D; &quot;1&quot;
    inputB &#x3D; &quot;2&quot;
    sum(inputA,inputB)
    //script.ts(6,9): error TS2345: Argument of type &#x27;string&#x27; is not assignable to parameter of type &#x27;number&#x27;.


Through the introduction of types in typescript, it easier to write more intuitive code. I will be writing a series of tutorial on typescript.
I will cover:

Typescript compiler
Classes &amp; Interfaces
Advanced Typescript features such as Generics &amp; Decorators

In this blog post, I will show you how to use Motion One in an Angular application. I will walk you through the installation process, create a simple animation, and use Motion One&#x27;s spring and timeline features.
Check out a live demo I&#x27;ve created that you can interact with as part of my Angular Animation Explorer.
First, we will need to add Motion One&#x27;s dependency via npm using the following command.
npm install --save motion

If you run into any typings issue from the library, try adding skipLibCheck: true to your tsconfig.json.

Actions
Reducers
Selectors
Effects


Effects that use Actions and Services
Effect tests rewritten with observer-spy
Effect tests and fake timers
Effects that don&#x27;t dispatch actions
Effects that use the NgRx Global Store
Effects that use the Angular Router
Components With Global Store
Component Store


Integration tests
Unit tests
Component store unit tests
Component unit tests that use the component store
Conclusion
Let&#x27;s start with the easiest one, which are the NgRx actions.
A reducer is a (synchronous) pure function that is invoked with the current state and an action.

                    <span>Install Certbot



  
  
  Full instructions are here


To install Certbot, you should have Snap installed as well. For instructions, follow this tutorial.

Then, update snap
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
To use Certbot you should have server_name in your Ngnix config. For example, this is a sample of how my Nginx config file looked like before Certbot.
server{
        root /home/pi/website;
        server_name example.slashtechno.com;
}

Once you have the config set up properly, restart nginx. On most systems it will be the following command.
sudo service nginx restart  
sudo certbot certonly --nginx  
sudo certbot delete</span>

                    <span>Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) is one of the most common forms of broken access control which OWASP recently listed as the number one application security issue in 2021. A quick search for &quot;IDOR&quot; on Hacker One&#x27;s Hacktivity feed shows that many top tech companies (and even the U.S. Department of Defense) have fallen victim to IDOR, in some cases paying out well over $10,000 per bug bounty. In this post, I&#x27;ll explain what IDOR is, what causes it, and ways to protect your application against it.
IDOR is an access control vulnerability that occurs when an application uses an identifier for direct access to an object in a database but doesn&#x27;t perform proper access control or authorization checks before querying or modifying the database.
