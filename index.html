                    <span>Sometimes it&#x27;s convenient to have one Next.js codebase serve multiple discrete sites. The sites might have different content and design but also share code - such as having the same React component to render the header or sidebar.
A typical example could be a web development agency that wants to put multiple customers on a shared platform, or a media house serving multiple brands.
This post aims to be an overview of methods to share code between multiple related Next.js projects.
Let&#x27;s dive into this topic and talk about the first big decision you have to make - multitenancy or monorepo.

Angular has allowed us to polyfill features back to browsers like IE 9, 10, and 11 for a while using the polyfills.ts file. With the introduction of Angular CLI 7.3 we get conditional polyfills, where we only ship the older polyfills to pre-ES2105 browsers. This results in a savings of about 56Kb. This won’t take you from average to superhero load times, but this is an easy optimization.
If you’re starting a new project, just make sure you have at least @angular/cli@7.3.0 installed globally via npm and ng new away!
If you have an older project there are a few more steps. Here is the outline:
Upgrade global CLI to 7.3
Upgrade project to CLI 7.3
Delete IE polyfills from polyfills.ts

Add flag to angular.json

Validate it’s working
First, upgrade your global …</span>

In this article I would like to talk about an often-used feature on a user-centric application - the scroll-to-top button for allowing a user to quickly scroll to the top of the page, without having to use the mouse. The end result would be something like this:

Let&#x27;s break up this implementation into 3 steps:
✔️ Set up the scroll-to-top button (with some nice styling).
I have used @angular/material for some easy styling. In order to display the button fixed to the bottom-right corner of the page (and some nice hover effects with opacity), I have used the below properties on the :host -

This is an interesting section. To begin with, we need to set up an Observable on the scroll event of the DOCUMENT. You may directly access the document object, or you may use an InjectionToken, provided by angular.
This observable starts emitting values as soon as the user starts to scroll up or down. Now we are not really interested in the actual scroll event, but we would like to check something important every time the scroll event is fired - and that is the scroll position. Angular makes this quite simple with the ViewportScroller service from @angular/common package. This service has few useful methods, and I am going to use two of them - getScrollPosition and scrollToPosition.

The getScrollPosition method returns an array of 2 numbers - the X and Y coordinate. I check if the Y coordinate is more than 0 (which means the user has scrolled down) and I enable the scroll-to-top button.
For this last part, I make use of the scrollToPosition method, which again takes in the X and Y coordinates, and I scroll to [0, 0].

However, before the companies could migrate from AngularJS to Angular, the pandemic arrived and disturbed all the arrangements. In light of the fact, AngularJS has extended the EOL for 6 more months i.e. till December 31, 2021,  after which AngularJS will not be providing support to the framework.

Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
Bootstrap is an open source CSS framework with many components for building responsive WEB interfaces.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)

So, Scale Set Agents in Azure Pipelines.
As the name says those are agents that you can install and run in Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, or VMSS.
As such, they can be scaled horizontally automatically, to make your build faster, more elastic, and eventually more flexible.

                    <span>Kubernetes has become the name of the game when it comes to container orchestration. It allows teams to deploy and scale applications to meet changes in demand while providing a great developer experience.
The key to handling modern dynamic, scalable workloads in Kubernetes is a networking stack that can deliver API management, a service mesh and an ingress controller. Kong Ingress Controller allows users to manage the routing rules that control external user access to the service in a Kubernetes cluster from the same platform.
This article will look at how you can use Kong for full-stack application deployments with Kubernetes. By full-stack, we mean Kong can handle:

                    <span>The popularity and demand of running containers in development is increasing day by day. The advantages of running containers over using the traditional methods of virtualization are known to all. But where does the data in the running container go. Let&#x27;s find out!
If we look at the image below-

There is a local machine which has a container running on it&#x27;s memory, and it wants to access data somewhere on the disk.
There are two ways by which docker allows us to do this-
Persisting state option 1- Blind mounts
Persisting state option 2- Volumes
Let us have a look at both of the methods-
If we look at the diagram above, on it&#x27;s left side, it shows a container on the RAM, which is accessing a mount on the DISK. This is a kind of quick way to access data on the disk of the machine.

                    <span>EBS is a storage volume for an EC2 instance.
By default while creating EC2 instance root volume is used 
Root volumes are set to deleted when instance is terminated.
Creating additional volume

After getting into volumes Click on Create Volume


Make sure you select the current available zone of which your instance is running.Select the additional volume size

Successfully volume created now it is available to attach to any instance

Now select additional volume and click on attach then select Attach Volume

Select the instance that you want to attach and click on attach 

Now volume status will be in-use

Now connect to your instance using ssh and execute following cmd
# sudo fdisk -l

you can see 

Its not enough that attaching a volume doesn&#x27;t make that additional volume usable.
# sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf

# mkdir myfolder
# sudo mount /dev/xvdf myfolder/


Now it is successfully attached and we can use it for read and write operations

Unmount additional volume
# umount myfolder/

Don&#x27;t detach additional volume directly from EBS please unmount it in specific instance
you can cross-check again 

Now go to the EBS volumes tab and select additional volume and detach it 

Now the detached volume will be available for use and data created in it will be also persisted and we can also attach it to another running instance 

Note: Please don&#x27;t use this below cmd if you want data to be persisted while attaching the volume to another instance
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf
If you use the above cmd again means data will be erased 
just use below cmds and mount the additional volume in any instance
# mkdir myfolder
# sudo mount /dev/xvdf myfolder/</span>

                    <span>Managing infrastructure on the cloud these days can be done in numerous ways, tools like Terraform, Pulumi, Cloudformation, and CDK have propelled the area of Infrastructure as Code(IaC) into new heights. While most of these tools require some basic programming knowledge or even learning new languages, like Terraform HCL, the true power lies in building a platform using these tools.
When building infrastructure, as infrastructure developers we tend to create it in ways where the author can create a new infrastructure easily, but not the remainder of the organization. This usually happens when as engineers we think the tool is built only for &quot;us&quot;, however this can be avoided by thinking about infrastructure as a product where our customer is the engineering team as a whole, this helps in en…</span>

                    <span>When building and running images locally for development purposes, many best practices are neglected. However, eventually the image gets deployed. For a real deployment we want to take additional steps.
I want to deploy a simple &quot;echo-server&quot; written in go.
This is a good example because it is a compiled language, and it spawns a long-running process with which we can interact via HTTP. That is usually the case when deploying application in container.

With the pace of change in the tech industry, modern organizations are experiencing the urgency to migrate from legacy apps to microservices to enhance digital customer experience. So now, more than ever, migration of legacy apps is crucial for enterprises to stay ahead of the curve.
Moreover, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on different sectors, the need to transform legacy apps is more prevalent than ever before. So, to respond to this new environment, enterprises must keep up with the technology and migrate the existing core business apps to microservices.

                    <span>Looking for ways to make sure that your deployments to different environments are identical and use the exact same package versions? Or does your company have requirements to be able to reproduce deployments and trace exactly what dependencies were used at a specific time? Great - continue reading!
Being dependent on open source 📦 npm packages means dependencies to the public npm registry and npm package maintainers &#x3D; constantly changing environment. This also means that you have the responsibility to keep track of what package versions were used in a specific deployment. This is a crucial task to reduce risks and make sure unintended changes have not been made.
Even without any change to package.json your builds may produce a different set of dependencies at different points in time (semver versioning and addition of new minor versions to public registries).
The slightest change in patch versions means your builds are no longer deterministic where you are guaranteed the exact same results - and deploying dependencies that have not been tested is never a good idea...
💡 For me, the way to go is to freeze your registry when you want to avoid accidental updates. Freezing a registry effectively locks down the state of your package versions and makes the registry read-only so that only intended changes are applied to code you trust.
The video below shows the easiest way to make your registry read-only using the Freeze policy in Bytesafe:




Benefits of using the Freeze policy in Bytesafe:
✅ Guaranteed exact same versions when testing and building your applications
✅ Deterministic and consistent results across all your environments such as Test, UAT and Production
🔗 This blog post also describes how to work with the Freeze policy to achieve consistent tests and builds.
I would love to hear what you think of this solution and how you avoid accidental updates today. I&#x27;d be happy to answer any questions you might have.</span>

                    <span>When building serverless applications, Lambda functions often form the backbone of the system. They might provide just a few lines of code, but these lines are usually what hold the whole architecture composed of many managed services together.
Event-driven architecture is what this style is called, and it&#x27;s most prevalent in serverless applications. API gateways collect requests from your users, convert them to events, and send these along the way. Sometimes an upstream service, like DynamoDB or SQS, can handle such an event directly to save on Lambda invocation costs.
More often than not, we need to apply some validation and transformation to an event so the service can handle it. That&#x27;s where Lambda comes into play, and that&#x27;s also one source of our timeouts.

I am learning Linux extensively from past couple of years which is helping me to learn more several Linux based tools. One of the frequent command is top among system administratots and engineers.
What is top command?
top command displays the Linux processes on the host. Here is the definition from the manual:
The top program provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system. It can display system summary information as well as a list of processes
or threads currently being managed by the Linux kernel. The types of system summary information shown and the types, order and size of information displayed for processes are all user configurable and that configuration can be made persistent across restarts.

                    <span>Linux is a popular operating system for servers, but it can also be used in other ways. You can install and run Linux on a regular computer, and the process isn&#x27;t that difficult. Once installed, you can run the Linux command line on that computer even if you don&#x27;t log in as root (the superuser).
For many people, the Linux command line can be a scary place. It looks different and feels different than what they&#x27;re used to. But I like to think of it as a tool that allows you to do very specific things, like nothing else can.

In the Linux command line, you type a command and get output in the same window. There are hundreds of commands and it can take a long time to master them. You can practice Linux and quickly master all the commands online.
The popularity of the Linux operating system, al…</span>

                    <span>The text editor I use daily is called vim (vi improved). It’s not a program for everybody, but it suits my needs well.
Vim is one of the most powerful text editor that exists. It&#x27;s a program that you can configure to make it do anything. It has a steep learning curve, and can take months or years to master. 
Vim can be used without the mouse, everything using key presses. My first experience with vi was really bad (I forgot everything about it) but once I got used to it and learned a couple of commands and a few ex commands I fell in love with vi.
You could wonder, when writing code why use a mouse at all?
Once you know the vim commands it&#x27;s very easy to use. It&#x27;s a great bonus that it can be used in the terminal, because it lets you quickly edit your system files or edit files remotely using ssh.
I was a fairly experienced computer user. I started using a computer around age 12 or so, taught myself basic programming when I was about 13, and eventually became rather adept at various aspects of the art of computing.

I found myself needing to do a lot of system administration, and in the past I would have used nano, but I decided to try vim. I’d heard good things about it in the past but had never really tried it, so I was curious.
Here are some reasons I switched to vi/vim : 
1) It is extremely fast 
Vim is probably installed on your computer, if you open a terminal you can type
$ vim

And to exit press ZQ. If in the rare situation it&#x27;s not installed, it is available in your package manager. However, even on a commercial OS like Mac OS X vim is available by default.
If you are new to vim, you can practice here</span>

                    <span>While preparing for my AWS DevOps Engineer Professional exam I had to understand and memorize the CodeDeploy LifeCycle hooks. As usual, AWS provides decent documentation. Here is an example about how the Run order of hooks is documented. However, I could not find a table with all three cased combined. So I created one and it did help me a lot during the study. And also, I had a question in the exam about the &quot;AfterAllowTestTraffic&quot; hook.

Note 1: The greyed out hooks in the table are reserved for CodeDeploy operations. They cannot be used to run scripts.
Note 2: Hooks on EC2 can be used to run scripts on instances, while hooks for Lambda and ECS can be used only to run Lambda functions.

Happy coding CodeDeploy lifecycle hooks!</span>

                    <span>In the past, I had already written two articles related to this topic. One was how to upload images to Cloudinary and the other was how to compress images with Node.js.
Today I decided to combine the knowledge from those articles. That is, I decided to compress the images and upload them to Cloudinary.
In this way, they will only spend credits on the space of the images and not on their compression and transformation.
Despite explaining step by step what we are going to do today, I recommend you go read the articles I mentioned.
Now with the introduction done, let&#x27;s code!
First let&#x27;s install the necessary dependencies:
npm install express multer cloudinary sharp

Now we need a basic API:

npm run develop watches config files


In previous versions of Foal, the develop command did not restart the server when a configuration file was changed. This was annoying and is the reason why, starting with v2.5, new projects generated by the CLI will watch configuration files.
createOpenApiDocument accepts an optional serviceManager


If you use createOpenApiDocument, in a shell script for example, the function accepts an optional serviceManager parameter from this version.
This can be useful if your OpenAPI decorators access controller properties whose values are manually injected.</span>

                    <span>Recently, I migrated a project I&#x27;ve been working on to TypeScript. I decided to use Webpack in combination with esbuild loader. The reason being esbuild ecosystem is still relatively new when compared to other bundlers like Webpack, rollup, parcel etc. in terms of plugins and loaders.
Code for this article is available here
At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. Basically it takes all your code, assets, dependencies and bundles them into static files that are easier to work with and deploy. You can read more about it here
ESbuild is an extremely fast JavaScript bundler, upto 10-100x fast. You can check the benchmark and read more here

In this blog post we will shed light on the server side.
Why do I need to handle i18n in my application&#x27;s backend?
Think of all user faced content not directly rendered in your browser...
For example you&#x27;re building a command line interface (CLI)?
You&#x27;re sending some emails?
Or you&#x27;re using server side rendering (SSR)?
etc.
We will show some examples that uses i18next as i18n framework. If you&#x27;re curious to know why we suggest i18next, have a look at this page.

Can we create a middleware out of any function, so that developers don&#x27;t have to worry about the tricky syntax and testing of middlewares
Well, the hardest part is over, defining the problem. Let&#x27;s get our hands dirty now. 
The generic syntax of a middleware is
//generic express middleware syntax
const middleware &#x3D; (req, res, next) &#x3D;&gt; {
  // EXECUTION LOGIC
  next(); // This is where the control leaves this middleware and moves to next item in the queue, which could be another middleware, or the final controller etc
}

Our intention is make it work in a way, that we should be able to inject the EXECUTION LOGIC dynamically. 
For this, we slightly move away from OOPS of JS and take help of a functional programmin…</span>

Managing secrets in cloud solutions can be a big challenge. Whether it&#x27;s a database password or a connection string to access a specific service — these values should be stored securely. In the Microsoft Azure cloud, there is a dedicated service called Azure Key Vault. It is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets. When thinking about secrets, we should have in mind that they can be in many different forms. A database password is a secret, a certificate is a secret, and a cryptographic key is also considered a secret.
Storing secrets in places like a configuration file can expose our application to vulnerabilities similar to the ones due to bad programming practices or bugs. Many developers struggle with managing secrets properly and looking for a solution to test the application locally without worrying about secrets management after deployment. This is where Azure Key Vault and Azure managed identities can help.
In this article, we will explore how to set up Azure Key Vault, store the secret in it, and access this secret from the ASP .NET Core application using Azure managed identity. We will learn how to combine using secrets locally and access them after the deploying to the Azure cloud.

                    <span>🔐 Passwordless authentication is a method to verify a software user without a password and can help increase security and reduce costs for any organization.



  
  
  
Passwordless authentication is the process of verifying a software user’s identity with something other than a password. The most common passwordless authentication methods include verifying the possession of a secondary device or account a user has or a biometric trait that is unique to them, like their face or fingerprint.
Passwordless authentication can reduce costs and security risks for any organization. And as Google Cloud’s director of product management Sam Srinivas explains, passwordless authentication usage will likely grow rapidly in the near future.

                    <span>In this article, we are going to highlight the importance of a fix that came with the 11th version of Angular Router. We will do so by examining a scenario where the lack of that fix prevents an intuitive solution from working, as well as understanding why the fix in question solves the problem.

The reader doesn&#x27;t need to have more than a basic knowledge of Angular Router. Although we will make use of some advanced concepts like UrlTree, UrlSegmentGroup, they will be briefly described before being applied.  
This article has been inspired by this Stack Overflow question.

                    <span>Enumerations are an awesome feature of typescript, you can create a set of distinct cases with numeric or string-based enums.
For example, if you&#x27;re working on a game of cards and figure out you could actully use enum to define the suits:
enum Suit {
  Clubs &#x3D; &#x27;♣️&#x27;,
  Spades &#x3D; &#x27;♠️&#x27;,
  Diamonds &#x3D; &#x27;♦️&#x27;,
  Hearts &#x3D; &#x27;♥️&#x27;,
}

Now, if you have a collection of objects and each object in the collection has a value represented by an enum, you can actually write a pretty neat function to split it into smaller collections, each limited to a certain enum value. In our case we could split a deck of cards into clubs, spades, diamods and hearts correspondently.
For the sake of simplicity our deck will have only 4 cards, namely 4 aces, one from each suit, here&#x27;s our small deck:

                    <span>Version 2.5 of Foal has been released! Here are the improvements that it brings.
npm run develop watches config files


In previous versions of Foal, the develop command did not restart the server when a configuration file was changed. This was annoying and is the reason why, starting with v2.5, new projects generated by the CLI will watch configuration files.
createOpenApiDocument accepts an optional serviceManager


If you use createOpenApiDocument, in a shell script for example, the function accepts an optional serviceManager parameter from this version.
This can be useful if your OpenAPI decorators access controller properties whose values are manually injected.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, End To End testing has become a regular topic of discussion in small team environments. The main reasons for this are the evolution of tooling and the need to shift towards high velocity product development. At Clerk , we use End To End testing to create bulletproof authentication flows across browsers.
In the past, End To End testing was almost exclusively considered a Quality Assurance Engineering topic. For one reason or another, the development of test automation pipelines and application workflow validation tests were not so popular with software engineers.
That view has gradually become dated and replaced with the growing popularity of tools like Cypress, Puppeteer, Playwright, and even the latest version of Selenium.

At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. Basically it takes all your code, assets, dependencies and bundles them into static files that are easier to work with and deploy. You can read more about it here

PropTypes provide built-in typechecking capabilities when writing a React app. Checking the type of prop in a React component in a large application helps catch bugs at run-time.
Typically in a React app, you will need to install the package yarn add prop-types. Then, inside a component, explicitly define the type of a prop.
import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import PropTypes from &#x27;prop-types&#x27;;

// A component that accepts &quot;color&quot; prop
function FavoriteColor({ color }) {
  return 
My favorite Color is {color}
;
}

FavoriteColor.propTypes &#x3D; {
  color: PropTypes.string
};

// Parent component

TypeScript provides a powerful system for working with types. There are the basic types you already know from JavaScript. For example, types such as number, string, boolean, object, symbol, null, undefined. This is not all TypeScript offers. On top of these types are also built-in utility types.

                    <span>A simple POC where Angular requests the URL of an image to the Quarkus back end and then renders the image in the screen. Quarkus returns the image in two ways: (1) a simple copy from the URL of the image; (2) the image encoded in Base64 with the Media Type.
The project is available on GitHub poc-http-copy-images.

Let&#x27;s imagine a hypothetical situation where only the backend have access to the URL of some images and you want to render these images on the frontend.
In this POC, I propose two ways of solving this problem:
The backend access the URL of the image and expose the same Response object;
The backend access the URL of the image, encode it into Base64 and expose it into a JSON object with the Media Type.
Optionally, you can run a Quarkus mock server which will provide three endpoints with the below images:
http://localhost:8090/image/earth.png
http://localhost:8090/image/moon.jpg
http://localhost:8090/image/solarsystem.svg
*** Optionally, because you can choose any image from the internet to run the test.
Enter inside the mock-server folder and type:
$ mvn quarkus:dev -Ddebug&#x3D;5006

The swagger will be available at:
http://localhost:8090/q/swagger-ui

Enter inside the quarkus folder and type:
$ mvn quarkus:dev -Ddebug&#x3D;5006

The swagger will be available at:
http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui

Enter inside the angular folder and type:
$ npm install
$ ng serve

The front end will be available at:
http://localhost:4200/
Ok, in this screen, just put the URL of any image you desire (of the mock or the internet) and click on Load Image:

After clicking in the button, the image will be displayed in two columns, the left one is the raw copy from the URL and the right one is the Base64 version:

Any new image searched will be shown and the previous ones will slide down:</span>

   Since LinkedIn has multiple functions, there is more than one way to answer this question depending on what purpose you want to utilize the platform for. Many people use it for exploring the jobs market and making themselves visible to potential employers. But my expertise is in using LinkedIn for B2B lead generation, and so I’m going to talk about the most effective ways to do that.

LinkedIn is an incredible tool for lead generation – there are millions of decision-makers regularly using the platform. But it is still relatively underused for lead generation given the massive potential for great leads it offers.
I’ve found that it’s important to conduct multiple activities on LinkedIn to really make the most of it and get those great le…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


In current days we host websites on Vercel and Netlify and we are automatically assigned a generated SSL to provide with Secured connection(HTTPS), but in the development period we are unaware of the process to run it with HTTPS and we miss out on some testing which works only on HTTPS like google apis, etc.
Configure creat-react-app project to handle https
Generate SSL Certificates for localhost
Add certificates to the project
Trust certificate in browser
Run the project secured
Add a file .env in the root directory of the project with the line
HTTPS&#x3D;true

Follow this article to generate a SSL certificate for localhost. and place the certificates in the root directory.
Generate an SSL Certificate With the Root Certificate for localhost

rootCA.key
rootCA.pem
rootCA.srl
server.crt
server.csr
server.csr.cnf
server.key
v3.ext

in the .env file add these two properties and there paths.
SSL_CRT_FILE&#x3D;server.crt
SSL_KEY_FILE&#x3D;server.key

Here you will be using the server.crt as your certificate file &amp; server.key as your key for certificate.
Follow this article to trust the certificate on your browser 
Hence you have HTTPS enabled for your project.

Conclusion
Okay so attempt #1 didn&#x27;t quite work, but all the package managers have a feature called Workspaces, which npm describes like this:
[Workspaces] provides support to managing multiple packages from your local files system from within a singular top-level, root package.
That sure sounds relevant, so let&#x27;s give it a try!



The npm documentation is so terse I&#x27;ve honestly no clue how to get anything working 🤷‍♀️. If you know your way around npm workspaces I&#x27;m happy to swap stories, but for now I&#x27;m giving up on this.



Documentation here is definitely a step up, with more examples to draw inspiration from. Still a bit hard to grasp though, but I also came across this nice &quot;actual complete guide to typescript monorepos&quot; article by @cryogenicplanet

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using sveltekit and svelte for over a year now. I&#x27;m also anxiously waiting for it to be matured enought to beat NextJs in terms of community. But I like them both.
So, on this weekend I wanted to turn one of my projects into a PWA. When I wanted to do with NextJs projects there were a lot of tutorials. But I couldn&#x27;t find many guides for svelte beginners.
That&#x27;s because svelte has pwa functionality built into it.
 A website
 manifest.json [ basic icons,names,shortcuts]
 service-worker [ for offline cache ]
So let&#x27;s get on with it.

We&#x27;ll create a demo Sveltekit project:
npm init svelte@next my-app


Then we&#x27;ll choose a simple config in vite for the sake of this article:

Choose typescript because ts &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; js:

Now we have a demo project setup with typescript, it will be straight-forward from here on:

Let&#x27;s get into our directory:
cd my-app

And run:
yarn


After that,
In the /static directory, We&#x27;ll create a manifest.json.
When svelte compiles the whole application the static files will be copied over to the build folder.

Then we&#x27;ll refer our manifest.json in src/app.html.

And finally we&#x27;ll create our src/service-worker.ts
Svelte will automatically detect the service-worker in the src folder&#x27;s root and then register our service worker during build.
Isn&#x27;t that neat?

Now we just need to build or app using yarn build:

Now we can preview our build using yarn preview:

&#x27;0&#x27; is that a &#x27;install app&#x27; button,

Svelte makes it easy to make PWAs.

The pwd command for to know you where you are now. For example your’re in download folder. Try the following type pwd and you will see that you’re in your download directory.
For Linux you can type clear or Ctrl+L to Clear the screen. It works in most terminal.
Command ls is equivalent to the DOS dir command, that it show lists files and directories. This command has some common attributes, example like:
ls -a for show all folders and files including visible and hidden.
ls -l for show the contents of the directory in full, starting from access rights, owner, group and the date the file or directory was created.
ls -i show directory contents and size.
For troubleshooting you can use command tail -f. Example like this tail -f /var/log/daemon.log.
If you want to see the previous commands, you can type history in your terminal. Meanwhile, to search command history in Linux, press ctrl+R, then just type the previous command you want to search or use.</span>

Example:

netstat -r: r stands for Routing. It will show kernel IP routing tables.
Example:

2. nslookup:
nslookup stands for Name Server lookup. It helps us to check the IP address mapped to DNS(Domain Name System) and vice versa. This is very useful when we want to troubleshoot the DNS related issue.

                    <span>Hi!We use smartphone,laptop and other devices. All of them access to the internet. Many files have malware, If you install or use these files, you will have many problems also hackers can access to your data such as accounts and passwords.I wrote name of some apps that you should not use these apps. I will introduce more secure apps.

*ngIf and *ngFor will remove elements from the DOM. There isn’t a CSS solution for animating a non-existing element in the DOM. But Angular provides us with a simple solution.
For purposes of brevity, wherever I refer to *ngIf it is equally applicable to *ngFor. The complete, working code can be downloaded here.
Let’s start with the default application generated by the CLI and just modify the nice Angular logo in and out of the view based on a button we add.
ng new ngifAnimation

You won’t need routing and can select SCSS for the styling.
Let’s add the button we want to use to toggle our *ngIf on the image. Open app.component.html and add a simple button: (this is the default HTML)

                    <span>Many people have been using this tool Metasploit. You came across on it on many tutorials and wondered how do you actually install this?
The Metasploit framework is a very powerful tool which can be used by cybercriminals as well as ethical hackers to probe systematic vulnerabilities on networks and servers. Because it’s an open-source framework, it can be easily customized and used with most operating systems.
With Metasploit, the pen testing team can use ready-made or custom code and introduce it into a network to probe for weak spots. As another flavour of threat hunting, once flaws are identified and documented, the information can be used to address systemic weaknesses and prioritize solutions.
Due to its wide range of applications and open-source availability, Metasploit is used by e…</span>

                    <span>Reverse Shells



  
  
  How do reverse shells work?


To make a connection to a typical remote shell, a machine controlled by the attacker connects to the remote network host and it requests a shell connection.
blind shell
But what if the remote host is not directly accessible, like it has public IP or is protected by a firewall?
In this situation reverse shells maybe shouldn&#x27;t be used, where the target machine initiates connection to the listening network host a shell is now established.
To start you need a listener process on their system to listen the reverse shell connections incoming to their IP address, Eg, 12.12.12.12
nc -lvnp 7070

The netcat listener will listen at port 7070. An attacker needs to execute the code to the listener. Many reverse shells needs programming langs

                    <span>Python is a great programming language, it has so many uses, but one thing that it doesn’t do well is help protect your hard work from others. Python source code is plain-text, which means that anyone with access to your files can see what you wrote. Not great when you’ve just written the latest advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) or the best machine learning (ML) algorithm on the planet.
Python has a great feature where it first compiles your source code into bytecode; this is a low-level platform-independent representation of your source code. Back in the days when computers were slow, this was helpful, but when trying to distribute secure code this is a problem. Most solutions for securing Python code involve the distribution of .pyc files. Now, this isn’t all that bad as it doe…</span>

                    <span>While companies increasingly look to cloud computing as a means to expand, modernize and stay competitive, so too do those companies expose themselves to new risks. In fact, Ermetic and IDC report that 80% of CISOs claim their company has had a cloud data breach in the past 18 months. Nearly half of those (43%) had experienced 10 or more breaches.
The benefits of cloud computing are numerous, but organizations cannot make the switch to this modern platform without understanding the risks involved and, more importantly, how to protect themselves, their staff and their customers.

                    <span>What is an Azure DevOps Personal Access Token (PAT)?


A personal access token (PAT) is used as an alternative to using a password to authenticate into Azure DevOps. When you&#x27;re working with third-party tools, APIs or the command line that don&#x27;t support Microsoft or Azure AD accounts or you don&#x27;t want to provide your primary credentials to the tool, you can make use of PATs.
PATs are easy to create when you need them and easy to revoke when you don’t.

When creating a new PAT you can select the organization where you want to use the token, and then choose a lifespan for your token. Say for example making it only active and usable for a period of 30 days. A PATs lifetime can be extended if needed, but cannot be longer than the maximum period of 1 year. You can also specify granular permissi…</span>

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
