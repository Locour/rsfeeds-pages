                    <span>Will I have to be on call?
In the last hour of Koan’s on-site interview we turn the tables and invite candidates to interview our hiring team. At face value it’s a chance to answer any open questions we haven’t answered earlier in the process. It’s also a subtle way to introspect on our own hiring process — after three rounds of interviews and side-channel conversations with the hiring manager, what have we missed? What’s on candidates’ minds? Can we address it earlier in the process?
So, you asked, will I have to be on call?
The middle of the night pager rings? The panicked investigations? Remediation, write-ups, post-mortems?
Patrick Collison’s been there, too:
And that&#x27;s how I ruined ducks for myself.

                    <span>A few days ago I asked Twitter how would one solve the task of implementing a button component that can also display an icon. Is it by adding an icon property to the button component or by having a separate icon component nested inside the button? I also asked why would one choose one approach over the other.

Quite a few people replied with their pros and cons for both options. In this post I’m going to try and summarize the points mentioned there. I think that’s quite valuable to have as a reference in the future.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s take an analytical look at several of the key library / frameworks and compare them to Vanilla JavaScript.
Basically, I want to explore these tools in various ways:
Installation Processes
Setup Processes
Code Management
Routing
Binding Props
Binding Events
Services (API Access, etc.)
Referencing Assets
Unit Testing
Code Execution (Build Process and Size)
To do this, four separate builds of the same project were implemented. There were three &quot;frameworks&quot;:
Angular
React
Vue
And, the fourth build was Vanilla JS.
The core logic was complex enough to use several parts of the frameworks, but simple enough I could build this in a reasonable time frame.

Moreover, here’s the complete step-by-step guide to hire AngularJS developers who would prove to be the perfect fit for your project.
Prepare the project description:
The first and foremost step is preparing the project description. Without a clear description, it’s difficult to find the right talents.  Also, make sure you have not missed any important details about your project. If you already have an existing developer team, you can get their assistance in this. This helps you determine what developer expertise you need. Besides, this will also assist the candidate to know whether they possess the necessary expertise to participate in your project.

                    <span>Building images in CI/CD pipeline can be quite different from builds on local machine. One major difference is availability of cache. In the local environment you most likely have all the resources, dependencies and image layers cached from previous builds and therefore your builds might take just a few seconds. In the CI pipeline on the other hand, there&#x27;s no local cache, which can cause the builds to take several minutes. There&#x27;s solution to this though, and in this article we will look at how we can solve it both with and without Docker and for any CI/CD platform you might be using.
The idea for the generic solution that would work in any environment is pretty simple - we need to somehow create or bring the cache to the pipeline. We have 2 options here - either we point the builder tool…</span>

As a former business owner, nonprofit board member, developer, and volunteer; I know of one consistent, daunting, universal expenditure all modern organizations face - their tech stack. While some items, such as hardware, have a front-loaded cost that can be justified and managed through a lifetime; taking an uncertain “digital leap” for philanthropic entities can be challenging. Even when it&#x27;s known and agreed that improvements to legacy systems and tools are needed, or that building something completely custom from the ground up to meet the demands of a digital-first economy is in order, there is always trepidation when it comes to modernization and understandably so.

Some of the common ES6 features are:
Supports constants/immutable variables.
The object-oriented features supported in ES6 are:
Classes: We can create classes in ES6. The class function essentially builds a template from which we may later create objects. When a new instance of the class is created, the constructor method is invoked.
ES5 ES6
What is the difference between let and const? What distinguishes both from var?
When declaring any variable in JavaScript, we used the var keyword. Var is a function scoped keyword. Within a function, we can access the variable. When we need to create a new scope, we wrap the code in a function.
Both let and const have block scope. If you use these keywords to declare a variable, it will only exist within the innermost block that surrounds them. If you declare a variable with let inside a block (for example, if a condition or a for-loop), it can only be accessed within that block.
The variables declared with the let keyword are mutable, which means that their values can be changed. It&#x27;s akin to the var keyword, but with the added benefit of block scoping. The variables declared with the const keyword are block-scoped and immutable. When variables are declared with the const keyword, their value cannot be modified or reassigned.
In ES6, arrow functions are introduced. The shorthand syntax for writing ES6 functions is arrow functions. The arrow function&#x27;s definition consists of parameters, followed by an arrow (&#x3D;&gt;), and the function&#x27;s body.
The &#x27;fat arrow&#x27; function is another name for the Arrow function. We won&#x27;t be able to employ them as constructors.
const function_name &#x3D; (arg_1, arg_2, arg_3, ...) &#x3D;&gt; {

    //body of the function

} 
It reduces the size of the code.

As you may know, JFrog Xray already allows you to scan the entire composition of your binaries and enables you to send alerts to your teams using webhooks, but now with our new Slack integration we make it quite easy for entire channels to be updated in real time. The integration further allows teams to discuss new CVE&#x27;s with developers on other teams as well.

                    <span>The fundamental rule to a secret is to not share a secret. Once shared it&#x27;s more likely going to be shared again and in an unsecure format, but how do we keep a secret a secret?
When it comes to Cloud technology we can use resources that store our sensitive information in a secure environment. For example, Azure Key Vault allows us to store secrets, certificates and keys where we can set access control using authentication methods like Azure AD.
But when we add secrets into a secure resource like Key Vault, how do we access them when running deployments?
In this blog post I will be covering how we get the secrets from an Azure Key Vault for a deployment in GitHub Actions.

Hybrid environments and emerging technologies are making it possible to meet customer demands while remaining effective in organizational expectations.

In the recent years, a lot of Python package developers moved their documentation pipelines from third party services like ReadTheDocs to GitHub Pages, but some useful features were missing in the process.
In this post, I&#x27;m going to describe how to write an -almost- complete RTD pipeline for GitHub Actions.
Support of pip and conda dependency files.
Build and deploy branches under /branches/

Build and deploy tags under /tags/

Secure build and preview of pull requests under /pull/ via labels.

The idea of this article is expalined in detail in the book Building Software Platforms. A Guide to SaaS Transition with AWS available on Leanpub and Amazon
The commoditization of cloud compute and the proliferation (and adoption) of managed cloud services during the first years of the past decade enabled the co-evolution of other software engineering practices that helped teams build and release software faster. This progression eventually led to DevOps, a technique that has helped reduce the dependency on a centralized operations team during the software development lifecycle.
But things have changed. We just don&#x27;t do cloud anymore. I mean, this is what we do 10 years ago when we spun up virtual machines on the cloud and installed We…</span>

                    <span>Motivação


Limitar o acesso aos metadados de uma instância faz parte de uma estratégia de segurança em camadas, que tem como objetivo impedir o acesso aos metadados por usuários/aplicações não autorizadas. 
Essa ação soma-se à utilização do IMDSv2.
Podemos utilizar regras de iptables para limitar o acesso, permitindo acesso a usuários ou grupos específicos.
O exemplo a seguir libera o acesso ao serviço de metadados da instância por todos os processos em execução na conta do usuário &quot;app&quot;.
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 --proto tcp --destination 169.254.169.254 --match owner --uid-owner app--jump ACCEPT

O exemplo a seguir impede o acesso ao serviço de metadados da instância por todos os processos, exceto os processos em execução na conta do usuário root.
sudo iptables --append OUTPUT --proto tcp --destination 169.254.169.254 --match owner ! --uid-owner root --jump REJECT

A ordem é fundamental, a regra de bloqueio deverá ser a última.
Obs.: O módulo owner do iptables só corresponderá à associação do grupo se o grupo for o grupo primário de um determinado usuário local. Outros grupos não são correspondidos.
Criei uma role Ansile para ser utilizada na configuração das instancias ou no processo de criação de AMIs
Repositório: EC2 Metadata Service restrict access
A configuração o acesso ao metadata está sendo limitado somente ao usuário root e/ou aqueles usuários que realizam sudo
As configurações foram feitas seguindo as seguintes documentações:
Documentação oficial da AWS
Apresentação sobre EC2 instance metadata

                    <span>SSH config ช่วยให้เรา config option ของแต่ละ host เอาไว้หลายๆอันได้ ทำให้ตอนเรียก ssh ใส่แค่ชื่อ hostname ใน config ก็พอแล้ว
เวลาใช้ ssh เพื่อ remote เครื่องอื่น ปกติแล้วจะสั่งประมาณนี้
ssh user@hostname

หรือถ้ามี port ที่ต่างจาก ssh ปกติ (22) ก็ใส่ option สำหรับ port เพิ่มคือ
ssh -p 2222 user@hostname

หรือถ้ามี IdentityFile ด้วย ก็ต้องเพิ่ม option ไปอีกแบบนี้
ssh -i identity.key -p 2222 user@hostname

ตัวอย่างเช่นผมจะ ssh เข้า Ubuntu ที่ลงไว้ใน Virtual Box โดยใช้ vagrant ปกติแล้วจะสั่ง vagrant ssh ก็ได้ แต่ถ้าจะสั่งด้วย ssh เองโดยตรงจะต้องสั่งประมาณนี้
ssh -i ~/vagrants/ubuntu/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key -p 2222 vagrant@127.0.0.1

ทีนี้ถ้าเราจะใช้ SSH config ช่วยเราก็สร้างไฟล์ config ที่ $HOME/.ssh/config
จากนั้นกำหนดค่าแบบนี้
Host ubuntu-vagrant
  HostName 127.0.0.1
  IdentityFile ~/vagrants/ubuntu/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
  Port 2222
  User vagrant

ลักษณะ config file ของ SSH ก็มี key เช่น Host, HostName, IdentityFile, Port และ User แล้วเว้นวรรคด้วย 1 ช่องว่าง ตามด้วยค่าที่กำหนดให้ key นั้นๆ 
แล้วก็มีการใช้ indentation เพื่อบอกว่าค่านั้นเป็น key/value ย่อยๆของ key หลักอีกที
จากตัวอย่างผมกำหนด Host คือ ubuntu-vagrant แล้วก็กำหนดค่า HostName เป็น IP หรือ Domain name ของ Host ที่เราต้องการต่อ แล้วก็ค่า IdentityFile ไปที่ path ของ private key ของ vagrant ที่กำหนดให้กับ VM ที่ต้องการ remote ตามด้วยค่า Port 2222 แล้วก็​ User คือ username ในทีนี้คือ vagrant
เสร็จแล้วหลังจากนั้นเวลาเราต้องการ connect ไปที่ Ubuntu ใน VM ก็แค่สั่ง
ssh ubuntu-vagrant

เท่านี้ก็ได้แล้ว</span>

                    <span>This blogpost is about linux memory management, and specifically about the question that has been asked about probably any operating system throughout history: how much free memory do I need to consider it to be healthy?
To start off, a reference to a starwars quote: &#x27;This is not the free memory you&#x27;re looking for&#x27;. 
What this quote means to say is that whilst the free memory statistic obviously shows free memory, what you are actually looking for is the amount of memory that can be used for memory allocations on the system. On linux, this is not the same as free memory.
Of course free memory is directly available, actually free memory, which can be directly used by a process that needs free memory (a free page). A free page is produced by the kernel page daemon (commonly named &#x27;swapper&#x27;),…</span>

I find it quite hard to find the right steps when you already have a set of technologies in your project, and as the title goes, my target audience are those who already know how to develop a backend application in Express + MongoDB but not how to write tests for it. If you are still with me, let&#x27;s get started. 
Node.js
JavaScript runtime environment outside of browser
Express
Backend application framework for Node.js
MongoDB
NoSQL database like JSON.
Jest
JavsScript testing framework maintained by Facebook
supertest
npm package that helps test HTTP
Prepare a mongodb in memory server for testing
Write tests with jest and supertest
(Optional) Set up NODE_ENV to test

                    <span>Providing captions for audio and video isn&#x27;t just a nice-to-have - it&#x27;s critical for accessibility. While this isn&#x27;t specifically an accessibility post, I wanted to start by sharing Microsoft&#x27;s Inclusive Toolkit. Something I hadn&#x27;t considered before reading this was the impact of situational limitations. To learn more, jump to Section 3 of the toolkit - &quot;Solve for one, extend to many&quot;. Having a young (read &quot;loud&quot;) child, I&#x27;ve become even more aware of where captions are available, and if they aren&#x27;t, I simply can&#x27;t watch something with her around.
There are two common and similar caption formats we are going to generate today - WebVTT and SRT. A WebVTT file looks like this:

I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re here, but I must confess that I am leading you down a path slightly different to what you would expect. Instead of transcribing video directly, this post will cover converting video files to audio files and then sending them to Deepgram. First, we will transcribe local files, and then we will download files programatically before transcribing them.
You will need:
Node.js installed on your machine - download it here.

                    <span>Here at Deepgram we run GRAM JAM - a series of internal hackathons to have Deepgrammers build cool projects using our own API. Sometimes the projects lead to product improvements, sometimes they get a laugh, and other times they are just super useful. This blog post is based on one of those projects - Bleepgram - built by the very interdisciplinary team of Faye Donnelley, Mike Stivaletti , Conner Goodrum, Claudia Ring, and Anthony Deschamps.
Sometimes we all let &quot;unprovoked or unintended utterances&quot; slip out of our mouth, and often it&#x27;s the job of an editor to go through recordings and overlay a bleep so no one has to hear the original word. Historically this has been a manual process, but with Deepgram&#x27;s Speech Recognition API we can work to censor them automatically.

First, we will download videos and convert them to mp3 audio files. Then, we will use Deepgram to generate a transcript.

My backend project, written in TypeScript/Express, uses dotenv for environment variables. dotenv package takes variables in from .env file, but when I looked for a solution, everyone had env or with inside workflow file, which never worked for me. So I had to figure out something else.
Add secrets to your repository
Add a step to create .env file inside your workflow
Go to repository&#x27;s Settings page



Go to Secrets from the sidebar menu



Click New repository secret to add secrets
GITHUB_.




  
  
  Add a step to create .env file in your GitHub workflow


Now that you have all secrets set up, you can access to them by ${{ secrets.YOUR_SECRET_NAME }}. Below is a working example workflow file.

                    <span>I struggled with this concept a lot, but let me save you the stress, and explain as simply as I can.
Typescript is just a secure way of writing JavaScript code. Do not get confused by the fancy terminologies people throw around it.
The good news is, if you know JavaScript, you already know ~90% of Typescript. The additional layer only forces you to be a lot more intentional about your variables and data types.
...
Simple answer? To catch errors early in your editor. 
...
let id &#x3D; 1
let company &#x3D; &quot;GYRO Design Lab&quot;
let isPublished &#x3D; true
let mandem &#x3D; [&quot;Dexter&quot;, &quot;Mide&quot;, &quot;Emmy&quot;]


But the unfortunate thing here is that, at some point later in your code, the variable company - for instance, could be re-assigned to a value of an entirely different data type, which would be unexpected behavior.

                    <span>In previous articles, we have talk about how to query with CouchDB Views and Mango Query. Both methods are working very well and able to cover a lot of use cases. Why Clouseau?
There are still very limited for CouchDB Views and Mango Query when we talk about search, there are a lot of complex searching required which makes the Views function and Mango Index more complex and harder to build, at the same time need to have a great search performance. You are still able to build your own search engine from scratch with Mango and Views. However it is very tough and you have to put a lot of resources to build a good search engine, ton of work like text preprocessing, tokenization, algorithm, ranking and etc...😰

                    <span>Many Node.js projects will reach a level of complexity where we&#x27;ll often find ourselves wondering what a certain object&#x27;s structure looks like. We&#x27;ll also have the need for early warnings about errors due to trying to access fields that don&#x27;t exist or assuming different types from what they really are. These are good indications that you would derive a lot of benefit from using a type-checking system such as TypeScript. This article will look into how to make the transition from JavaScript to TypeScript in an existing project.
TypeScript-support for Node.js is provided by the typescript NPM package. The best way to implement this package will depend on your project&#x27;s build tooling. If you have webpack set up, then the easiest way will be by using the ts-loader package (see the &quot;Setting up …</span>

Express Js Is Web Framework For Node.js
Most Popular Use Of Express Js In the Current Time Is To Create Web Apis.
Also Some People Are Using To Create Full-stack Web App With using Pug, Ejs, Or Basic HTML
here we are going to create a simple API to understand concepts of express
You need Node.js Installed In Your System. You can download node.js from Node.js


Open New Directory And Write This command to initialize a new project.
npm init -y



-Now install express as dependencies for your project
npm install express
Create index.js file and import express js &amp; initialize the app

Create an endpoint 
in simple term endpoint is a path where you are getting expected data
/users return all users
/products returns all products

/ where we are sending hello world as a response.
3 Open a port for connections

Run application
&gt; write node index.js to start the application

open localhost:3000 on browser





  
  
  hooray you made it 🥳

                    <span>Motivação


Limitar o acesso aos metadados de uma instância faz parte de uma estratégia de segurança em camadas, que tem como objetivo impedir o acesso aos metadados por usuários/aplicações não autorizadas. 
Essa ação soma-se à utilização do IMDSv2.
Podemos utilizar regras de iptables para limitar o acesso, permitindo acesso a usuários ou grupos específicos.
O exemplo a seguir libera o acesso ao serviço de metadados da instância por todos os processos em execução na conta do usuário &quot;app&quot;.
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 --proto tcp --destination 169.254.169.254 --match owner --uid-owner app--jump ACCEPT

O exemplo a seguir impede o acesso ao serviço de metadados da instância por todos os processos, exceto os processos em execução na conta do usuário root.
sudo iptables --append OUTPUT --proto tcp --destination 169.254.169.254 --match owner ! --uid-owner root --jump REJECT

A ordem é fundamental, a regra de bloqueio deverá ser a última.
Obs.: O módulo owner do iptables só corresponderá à associação do grupo se o grupo for o grupo primário de um determinado usuário local. Outros grupos não são correspondidos.
Criei uma role Ansile para ser utilizada na configuração das instancias ou no processo de criação de AMIs
Repositório: EC2 Metadata Service restrict access
A configuração o acesso ao metadata está sendo limitado somente ao usuário root e/ou aqueles usuários que realizam sudo
As configurações foram feitas seguindo as seguintes documentações:
Documentação oficial da AWS
Apresentação sobre EC2 instance metadata
PDF da Apresentação sobre EC2 instance metadata

                    <span>This repo is designed to convert any data, number and text into barcode. The barcode you produce is valid everywhere and when you read it with a barcode reader, it shows the data you entered. It is a very practical and fast way to encrypt or organize products.
Any data you convert to barcode will be valid everywhere. You can scan and save them with the barcode reader and organize the products in a shop.
In addition, you can use your passwords or data that you do not want anyone to see by converting them to barcodes.
It is not risky to make this conversion on the website. Because it is completely coded with vanilla JS. Since there is no database or registration network, you can use it with peace of mind. 
Also, your comments and interest are very important to me. I look forward to your feedback.
Take care and don&#x27;t forget to fork :)

                    <span>The fundamental rule to a secret is to not share a secret. Once shared it&#x27;s more likely going to be shared again and in an unsecure format, but how do we keep a secret a secret?
When it comes to Cloud technology we can use resources that store our sensitive information in a secure environment. For example, Azure Key Vault allows us to store secrets, certificates and keys where we can set access control using authentication methods like Azure AD.
But when we add secrets into a secure resource like Key Vault, how do we access them when running deployments?
In this blog post I will be covering how we get the secrets from an Azure Key Vault for a deployment in GitHub Actions.
We will need login to Azure using the Azure CLI. The first workflow step will be the following:

In this tutorial, I will generate a TypeScript client code based on the Swagger documentation and use it on a simple React application (it can be any front-end application).
Why we want to do something like this? First of all, it&#x27;s better to have one a single source of truth for the contracts in our server-client architecture. Otherwise, one change can break all our consumers.
For this process, I&#x27;m gonna use swagger-typescript-api. I&#x27;ve seen this tool constantly evolving throughout the last year, its maintainers are doing an awesome job.

                    <span>É possível converter os dados de um formulário HTML para JSON de forma muito prática.
Primeiro selecionamos nosso elemento form
Então criamos uma instância de FormData usando nosso form
Então podemos usando Object.fromEntries usando o método entries da instância FormData




const form &#x3D; document.querySelector(&#x27;form&#x27;)
const data &#x3D; new FormData(form)
const values &#x3D; Object.fromEntries(data.entries())
console.log(values)

Desta forma temos todos elementos do formulário mapeados num objeto JSON, como esperado.

Precisa fazer as seguintes etapas:
Criar o diretório com o nome do seu projeto
Criar o package.json
Criar o tsconfig.json
Instalar as dependências


esbuild
esbuild-serve
typescript
prettier
Criar o diretório src
Escrever o TypeScript inicial dentro de src

Criar o diretório public/styles
Escrever o HTML inicial dentro de public

Escrever o CSS inicial dentro de public/styles

Criar a configuração do ESBuild
Criar a configuração do prettier
Adicionar &quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot; ao package.json

Adicionar o script de build ao package.json

Adicionar o script de start ao package.json

Executar o npm start



Ou então compactar tudo isso em um script bash e usa-lo da seguinte forma
./create-project.sh meu-projeto

Segue o código do script
Ele é extremamente simples e resolve o propósito com excelência.
Espero ter ajudado, até a próxima.

                    <span>I struggled with this concept a lot, but let me save you the stress, and explain as simply as I can.
Typescript is just a secure way of writing JavaScript code. Do not get confused by the fancy terminologies people throw around it.
The good news is, if you know JavaScript, you already know ~90% of Typescript. The additional layer only forces you to be a lot more intentional about your variables and data types.

But the unfortunate thing here is that, at some point later in your code, the variable company - for instance, could be re-assigned to a value of an entirely different data type, which would be unexpected behavior.

                    <span>Pipeline operators are an upcoming feature to Javascript which gives us another way to pass values through a series of transformations. It gives more context to what developers were trying to achieve when they wrote their code, and allow us to do some cool things to boot. Here, we&#x27;ll take a quick look at pipeline operators, how they work, and how you can use them today.
Currently, no browser or server side ECMAScript implementation (like Node.JS) support pipeline operators. You can, however, get them to work using Babel 7.15. You can learn more about installing Babel here, but suffice to say this will allow you to add pipeline operators into your code.
Pipeline operators are simply another way to manipulate values in Javascript. The pipeline operator is |&gt;. Suppose we have 3 mathematical f…</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Hello, DEV World! 👋
This weekend I had time to refactor my old projects, where I found an interesting case of working with JWT in a Vue.js web application, which I&#x27;ll tell you about now.
🔥 Disclaimer: The article is intended primarily for advanced frontend developers, because it does not contain a beginner&#x27;s description of technologies in use. You should already understand how the Vue 3.x framework and Vuex 4.x works, and the basics of JWT.
OK, let&#x27;s go! 😉

A lyrical digression about the backend
The main component of the Vue app


The structure of the business logic
Function for updating tokens
Function for calling the background update tokens
The result we got

                    <span>Masonry views on a website are visually appealing. Let&#x27;s quickly create a carousel with you using TailwindCSS. This article assumes basic knowledge of Tailwind.
First of all, let&#x27;s add @layer to your index.css file in src folder. We create masonry layout class for 3 different screen;
.masonry         (1 column)
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer utilities {
    @variants responsive {
        .masonry {
            column-gap: 1.5em;
            column-count: 1;
        }
        .masonry-sm {
            column-gap: 1.5em;
            column-count: 2;
        }
        .masonry-md {
            column-gap: 1.5em;
            column-count: 3;
        }
        .break-inside {
            break-inside: avoid;
        }

    }
}

Now you can use these classes as standard TailwindCSS feature. You should use them inside parent div.

That is all. You now have a masonry layout that is simple to use and looks good.</span>

Have you ever faced an issue where you have many TypeScript files but want them all to convert into one Single JavaScript file so that you can reference it from your HTML? Then fear you not! Let&#x27;s get it done in the simplest way!! 
We&#x27;ll be using Webpack with TypeScript. Let&#x27;s start!
Create a folder and open it in your favorite editor (mine VS Code). Then type this command on your project terminal
npm init -y

(It&#x27;ll create a package.json file to track all the packages that you&#x27;d download and so on)
For those who are a bit lost on how to set up the environment and run the TypeScript files, check this one out TypeScript SETUP by SilvenLEAF
Well anyway, in short (for details, checkout the above link)

                    <span>Many Node.js projects will reach a level of complexity where we&#x27;ll often find ourselves wondering what a certain object&#x27;s structure looks like. We&#x27;ll also have the need for early warnings about errors due to trying to access fields that don&#x27;t exist or assuming different types from what they really are. These are good indications that you would derive a lot of benefit from using a type-checking system such as TypeScript. This article will look into how to make the transition from JavaScript to TypeScript in an existing project.
TypeScript-support for Node.js is provided by the typescript NPM package. The best way to implement this package will depend on your project&#x27;s build tooling. If you have webpack set up, then the easiest way will be by using the ts-loader package (see the &quot;Setting up …</span>

This article will introduce you to the concept of migrations in AdonisJs.
In the previous articles, we learned 2 approaches to working with events in AdonisJs. In this fifth installment of the everything you need to know about adonisJs series, we will familiarize ourselves with the concept of migrations. The aim is to have a broader understanding of how our database state will look like.

I will link the resources at the end of the article.
Let&#x27;s get started.
Just to remind you how our database should look like, we&#x27;ll reference this diagram.

There is an excellent feature called Marble tests from RxJS to test asynchronous code synchronously. We could easily use it in Angular unit tests. I have made a few basic examples about testing code by Marble tests in Angular.
My project is using Angular, so I have created a new project (using Angular CLI) by typing in console:
ng new marble-tests

My demo project is quite simple, so I answered no on

                    <span>Introdução


Provavelmente você já deve ter ouvido sobre &quot;processos&quot; enquanto estava mexendo em seu computador. A maioria de nós talvez só nos damos conta da existência deles em &quot;momentos ruins&quot;, por exemplo, quando alguma aplicação está travada e temos que &quot;finalizar o processo dela&quot;. Contudo, fora o conhecimento em saber como finalizar o &quot;bendito&quot; para você continuar exercendo suas atividades, algo importantíssimo também é entender qual é a real importância de um processo.
Quando estamos trabalhando em um ambiente multiprogramado/multitarefa, o Sistema Operacional (SO) é responsável por gerenciar diversos programas executados &quot;concorrentemente&quot;, controlando o compartilhamento dos recursos para cada um deles. Para que isso seja possível, todo programa executado deve sempre estar associado…</span>

                    <span>Introdução


Se você já faz parte ou tem interesse de entrar no mundo do hackvismo, provavelmente já deve ter ouvido falar do Kali Linux. Nessa postagem, eu pretendo falar um pouco sobre essa distribuição, e também, ensiná-lo como você pode estar criando um pendrive bootável no modo live com o mesmo, utilizando apenas a linha de comando do seu terminal. Sem mais delongas, vamos começar!
PS: Caso você não saiba o que é &quot;bootável no modo live&quot;, significa que você poderá inicializar o sistema operacional direto do seu pendrive, com isso, você não precisará necessariamente fazer a instalação do Kali Linux em sua própria máquina.
O Kali Linux é uma distribuição GNU/Linux baseada no Debian, totalmente open source, que é mantido e financiado pela Offensive Security. Ele é usado para pentesting, a…</span>

                    <span>It’s not that unusual to need to see/check/verify the binary output of a shell command in HEX format. Clearly, I mean without picking up a HEX editor or something like that. Last time, it happened to me a few days ago when I was to inspect the content of a base64-encoded string. The tool to the rescue is (of course not limited to) xxd. 🏅
Using xxd, to get the HEX representation for some binary content you just need to call it with no argument:
echo -n &#x27;Computer says: &quot;Hello World!&quot;&#x27; | xxd

Depending on the case it could be more insightful to also have the ASCII values column. That’s simply done by calling xxd with -C option:
echo -n &#x27;Computer says: &quot;Hello World!&quot;&#x27; | xxd -C

Which results in such a neat output:
00000000: 436f 6d70 7574 6572 2073 6179 733a 2022 Computer says: &quot;
00000010: 4865 6c6c 6f20 576f 726c 6421 22 Hello World!&quot;

Also, xxd can do things the other way. For instance, may you need to turn a HEX string into a binary content, just call xxd with -r option, like this:
echo -n &quot;0x48656c6c6f20576f726c6421&quot; | xxd -r

Which would result in:
Hello World!

There are more xxd options which you can find by checking:
xxd --help

or
man xxd

About Regular Encounters

I’ve decided to record my daily encounters with professional issues on a somewhat regular basis. Not all of them are equally important/unique/intricate, but are indeed practical, real, and of course, textually minimal.</span>

For example I want to make remaps to do things like open the current file in lookatme.

Before we start, it is assumed that you are:
Familiar with basic Linux commands and operation
Aware of what Hadoop is and how it works




  
  
  Initial setup


Set up a virtual machine (VM) or cloud instance (or physical machine, if you wish) with a fresh installation of Ubuntu 20.04. Ensure that the VM or cloud instance is reachable from the host (with ping or otherwise), and that the appropriate ports are open if a firewall is enabled. For the purposes of this tutorial, you may wish to disable the firewall (the default in Ubuntu 20.04) and / or enable all inbound traffic for the security group (or equivalent) associated with the cloud instance if you are using one, though note that you …</span>

                    <span>When you use Ubuntu server or other Linux server, you need configures IP Address using CLI interactive. Now i can show you how to configures IP Address in Ubuntu and Debian. Let&#x27;s start
Ubuntu
first, you should know where is the interface when you assign an IP. Type this command on your terminal:
$ ifconfig   
or
$ ip address

after that, so we can assign an IP to interface &#x27;ens33&#x27; by type this command:
$ sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml

then type this:
network:
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      addresses: [172.16.238.20/24]
      gateway4: 172.16.238.2
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8]
  version: 2


after all, you must apply or enable the configure:
$ sudo netplan apply
$ ifconfig

2: ens33:  mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:0c:29:77:41:f0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.16.238.20/24 brd 172.16.238.255 scope global ens33
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::20c:29ff:fe77:41f0/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

Debian
Okay, after that i think you should configure too in Debian side. First thing, type this command on your Debian terminal:
$ nano /etc/network/interfaces

after that, add this command to assign an IP:
auto ens33
iface ens33 inet static
address 172.16.238.10/24
gateway 172.16.238.2
nameservers 8.8.8.8

finally, save it by type ctrl+s to save then ctrl+x to exit. Let&#x27;s apply:
$ /ete/init.d/networking restart

[ ok ] Restarting networking (via systemctl): networking.service.

then check your IP configure:
$ ip address

2: ens33:  mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:0c:29:a0:41:4e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.16.238.10/24 brd 172.16.238.255 scope global ens33
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::20c:29ff:fea0:414e/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever</span>

                    <span>Çeşitli proje ve durumlarda ilk karşımıza çıkan önemli bir sorunun &quot;hangi sunucu işletim sistemini tercih etmeliyim?&quot; olduğunu düşünüyorum. Çünkü en basitinden üzerine kurulacak uygulamanın bağımlılıklarının belirlenmesi, güncelleme süreçlerinin yönetilme süreçleri için ortaya çıkacak cevap oldukça önemli. 
Her ne kadar bu soru &quot;konteynır&quot; mimarileriyle birlikte önemini biraz yitirse de sanal makine (VM) kullanımının hala ciddi oranda kullanıldığı alanlarda bu yapı devam etmektedir. Bu yazımda genel olarak konteynır sistemlerle ilgili bir yorum içermemektedir. Bu konu hakkında ayrıca bir yazı yazma düşüncem var.

                    <span>You have to understand what a shell is in relation to the kernel to understand what really happens when you run a command.

The Kernel is the most fundamental part of a computer operating system. It’s a program itself and it controls all other programs on the computer. It talks to hardware and software and is highly involved in resource management.
The Shell is an application that executes programs called commands through an interactive user interface with an operating system. It is the layer of programming that understands and executes the commands a user enters. In some systems, the shell is called a command interpreter.
Use the syntax below to write a command with an argument.

This time, I will try drawing line charts with specific design.
I have tried drawing line charts with Chart.js.
【TypeScript】Try Chart.js
[TypeScript][Chart.js] Play my own voice 3
But because I couldn&#x27;t find how to draw additional lines with specific format like dashed lines.
C3.js | D3-based reusable chart library
Node.js ver.17.0.1
TypeScript ver.4.4.4
C3 ver.0.7.20

                    <span>I only found lists polluted with dead/toy/component-library OSS projects. (or even containing AngularJS projects)
I want to find some real and alive open source projects which are using Angular. I&#x27;m sure some of us want to dive deeper and read some Angular code used in real life.
Feel free to mention projects in the comments and I will try to keep the list up to date.

                    <span>Do it
But how does Angular know how to deal with this (click) thing? 
It works because of the so called Event Biding. Basically it binds the target event name (click) to a method from the component (doSomething).
As explained in this nice article , Angular doesn&#x27;t have a list of it&#x27;s own event names, but it actually uses the names of the underlying DOM events.
So the event binding part of the Do it snippet is the equivalent of this vanilla snippet:
element.addEventListener(&#x27;click&#x27;, () &#x3D;&gt; { doSomething() });


This means the if I want to know which events I can bind to in Angular I can search them here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
What about the $event?
If the event is a DOM event, like click, mouseenter, keyup etc then the $event is the event itself. For example in the case of click, the $event is a MouseEvent.
EventEmitter) the $event is actually the emitted data.</span>

                    <span>How to deploy and angular app to GitHub pages and get it running under your own domain: username.github.io. Also you can use the GitHub API to get access to your repositories data as I did on my personal portfolio:
Live demo
Source code
Git
GitHub account
Angular CLI
Create a new public repository using your GitHub username and this form:
username.github.io

First, clone the newly created repository to a local folder:
$ git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
Navigate to the repository root folder:
$ cd username.github.io
Create a new angular project in the root directory of the repo:
$ ng new myApp --directory ./
Open angular.json file and change the buildOutput path to “docs”:
angular.json
…
&quot;architect&quot;: {
        &quot;build&quot;: {
          &quot;builder&quot;: &quot;@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser&quot;,
          &quot;options&quot;: {
            &quot;outputPath&quot;: &quot;docs&quot;,
…

Build the angular application in production mode:
$ ng build --prod
You can push the /docs folder only, or you can push the whole application /myApp (recommended):
$ git add .
$ git commit -m &quot;Init app&quot;
$ git push
Now navigate to your repository settings https://github.com/username/username.github.io/settings

scroll down to the GitHub pages section to change the build source to /docs. Few seconds later your site will be built and published and you should see the message “Your site is published at…”. If don’t, try refreshing the site.

Then you can view the deployments at the right side of the repository, under environments, pressing github-pages or at https://github.com/username/username.github.io/deployments

You can make changes locally, test them using $ ng serve and then build for production using $ ng build --prod and push your updated code to GitHub. The page will automatically re-build.</span>

                    <span>You are logged into your system. In this case, it&#x27;s macOS. You are facing just a simple question. Are you the only one who is logged in? I would like to give you an answer to this simple question with a bit of explanation. Here in upcoming lines, there will be a bit of theory background behind it.
In case your system is healthy (understand as an official system with applied updates), you are the only physical user logged in. You can check this logged in information with a simple command you will enter into the terminal. But there is a trick in that, will explain in next lines hereunder. Open your Terminal.app you&#x27;ll find out in Finder in the section Applications and Utilities. For more informations check official Terminal User Guide.
By entering uptime command you&#x27;ll be informed in one line output about the current time, number of days your system is up, number of logged-in users etc.
uptime

If you&#x27;ll enter this very same command into the terminal in capital form as UPTIME, you&#x27;ll receive a more readable summary of the logged-in sessions by the user.
UPTIME

The same output can be given by entering w command into the terminal.
w

Do remember you will always have a minimum of 2 logged-in users. By default when you open another terminal session it will be counted as another active user logged in. In other words, if you open four-terminal sessions, you will see 4 users logged in +1 as the default logged-in user I have written about.</span>

It&#x27;s really a great addition to any developer&#x27;s tool chain, because it lets you revise your local commit history—before you share your work with the rest of the team. Let&#x27;s see what you can do with an interactive rebase and then look at some practical examples.
