                    <span>Custom Angular update schematics are executed in the alphabetical order by their names declared in migrations.json.
When maintaining a custom Angular library and making breaking changes in major version, you&#x27;d like to provide your library users with a smooth migration path (nobody likes to spend much time fixing problems after upgrading npm dependencies, right?). For that purpose you can leverage scripts (aka. Angular custom schematics) that will apply code modifications to fix the breaking changes directly in user&#x27;s codebase - when running a command, i.e. ng update @my/lib@2.0.0.
All the migration scripts of schematics are declared in a json file, i.e. migrations.json. And each of them is assigned to specific version (so you can have different schematics for migration from 1.x to 2.0, and different from 2.x to 3.0).
But you might have multiple schematics targeted for the same version, i.e. 2.0.0. In case  the order of schematics matter, you need to be aware that they are executed always in the alphabetical order by the name. That&#x27;s why we should care about the prefix convention in migrations.json declared in our lib, for example numbering -01-, -02-, ...:
{
  &quot;schematics&quot;: {
    &quot;migration-v2--01-components&quot;: {
      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.0.0&quot;,
      &quot;factory&quot;: &quot;./2/component-migration#migrate&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Migrate components&quot;
    },
    &quot;migration-v2--02-services&quot;: {
      &quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.0.0&quot;,
      &quot;factory&quot;: &quot;./2/services-migration#migrate&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Migrate services&quot;
    },
  }
}

To proof it&#x27;s not the order of keys in the JSON that determines the order, but the alphabetical order of the keys (migration-v2--01-components, migration-v2--02-services), see the GitHub @angular/cli source code - sorting schematics by name.</span>

                    <span>We are living in a world which is covered by lots of applications and we know that these applications are still growing every single day. When the competition is so high, you need to keep your application up to date or updated to meet the requirements of the users. Your application must be fast in terms of loading and moving from different sections, if users find it slow they will surely leave your application. 
You need to develop such applications which can handle the multiple requests without sacrificing the user&#x27;s experience. Let’s understand it by implementing Angular Resolver.
What is Angular Resolver
The main aim of Angular Resolver is to  pre-fetching data when a user switches between one route to another. It will be a very smooth approach for user experience and it loads the data before the user navigates.
In our article, we also discussed the General Routing Flow v/s Angular Resolver Routing Flow, read article for more details.
We also mention why one should choose Angular Resolvers and what is Resolve Interface.
Lets understand the quick steps of Angular Resolver - How to Implement?

Pinterest once committed to paying a smashing $170 million for AWS services in advance and was then forced to buy extra capacity at a much higher rate, spending some $20 million more than estimated. 
How are you supposed to reserve capacity in advance when you have no idea how much of it your company is going to need one or three years from now?

                    <span>Learning a new skill always begins with a simple &quot;how to&quot; guide. The same holds true for learning Linux.
If you&#x27;re interested in Linux, a complete and open source operating system, you&#x27;ve likely encountered some &quot;how to&quot; guides. But learning Linux is more than just following instructions—it&#x27;s about understanding why you do what you do, and not just what to do.
As a beginner, knowing how to get started with Linux can be tricky. You may find yourself overwhelmed by the sheer number of resources out there. How do you choose? What&#x27;s going to work for you and your unique set of skills?

Of course, the first step is to get Linux on a computer. For new users, it&#x27;s not that hard—Linux is now available on everything from Chromebooks to Raspberry Pis.

                    <span>When we create Docker objects such as images, containers, volumes, etc., all these objects are stored inside a directory in our local machine. By default, all the Docker objects are stored in the following directory.
/var/lib/docker/storage-driver
Moreover, the contents stored inside the /var/lib/docker path depend on the storage driver that you are using as well. Let’s first understand the docker storage drivers in short.
Docker Storage Drivers
In an ideal case, very little amount of data gets written onto the writable layer of a Docker container. And we use volumes in Docker to write such data. But there are some workloads that require us to be able to use the container’s writable layer to write data and this is exactly where storage drivers in Docker come in.

                    <span>When it comes to exploring a Docker container’s file system, it can be in two ways - interactive and non-interactive. In short, interactive exploration of a Docker container’s file system can be done by accessing the file system through the bash of the container. While on the other hand, non-interactive exploration relates to studying the filesystem without entering the container environment either through tar files or copying the filesystem of the container.
Let’s try to discuss both these ways in this article.
Interactive Exploration of a Container File System
A container can be in two states where we can explore its file system - non-running and running. By non-running containers, we mean that the container is either not yet created or created but stopped. To explore the file systems of…</span>

It&#x27;s been close to 3 years (newbie in Linux standards) since I&#x27;ve made the switch to full time desktop Linux and I just want to put it out there that I&#x27;ve been really enjoying the whole  journey and learned a lot from the community than I ever did from anywhere else. It had helped me understand more about software and  computers and also improved my workflow and speed up computing tasks in general and my love for the terminal keeps on reaching newer heights.
I believe that Linux would be very interesting for those people who likes the DIY approach and since Windows 11 doesn&#x27;t offer decent support for older hardware that can be one of the many reasons for you to change to a much more free and privacy respecting more secure and open operating system build by the people without business intentions (*not all though).
Don&#x27;t blindly switch to Linux when someone says so! It&#x27;s not for everybody and I respect that. But for any of you interested in switching to full time Linux. Do watch this: linux-for-windows-users (The guy doing the video is not from a tech background!)
Do check out my blog (some things have improved from the time of writing): reasons-i-switched-to-linux
PS: Neither am I an activist nor trying to stir up any debate here Just the user!. I do respect other people&#x27;s effort. But I prefer Linux over other operating systems that&#x27;s all.

                    <span>Vim and Terminal!?


Vim was made to work with the command line. Many beginners do not understand what are the true capabilities of Vim, myself included:) Vim can run terminal commands without leaving the text editor, open an instance of a terminal, work with shell environments, and other things depending on the use case.
You can run the shell commands from inside of Vim by just using :! before the command, : means you have to be in command mode. Just after being in command mode, the ! or bang operator will execute the command typed after it from the terminal(Linux/ macOS) or your default shell(Windows -&gt; CMD/Powershell).
:!pwd

The above command from vim will redirect to the terminal and show the output of the command and return on pressing any key. In this case, it will execute the PWD c…</span>

                    <span>Hello everyone. Actually this post is not to tell anything to you, but more for some suggestions and ideas. I am trying to make Keep Clone Web App, with my own api. But there&#x27;s one thing I am stuck on, and that is search functionality. I want this functionality at api level and not on client side for obvious reasons. Can anyone help me out? I know this is not a perfect place to ask questions but I also wanted to share this with you.
Here&#x27;s the link to the hosted app. 
https://keep-clone-api.herokuapp.com/
It uses MongoDB linked to my own account. Up untill now there&#x27;s no user authentication, but I am planning on doing this later once basic functionality is completed. 
And if you need github repo of the same, please ask me. I will share that as well. Any suggestions are welcome, but main topic is that how can I implement search feature on api side. 
Thank you.</span>

                    <span>This article assumes you have a fair knowledge of the basic setup of project and connection sequelize database.
Let&#x27;s make a sequelize-app Node application and install Sequelize. First off all,create a directory for our project, enter it, and create a project with the default settings:
$ mkdir sequelize-app 
$ cd sequelize-app 

Initialize a NodeJS application by running the following command:
$ npm init -y

This will create a package.json file with a basic config. You can manually add the configuration by omitting the -y flag.
Next we&#x27;ll create the application file with a basic Express server. Let&#x27;s call it app.js to and run the following command line within the project folder.
$ npm i express

Add the following codes in the newly created app.js file
const express &#x3D; require(&#x27;express&#x27;);

1. Crear un archivo package.json 



Crea un archivo package.json preguntandote por la configuración del proyecto en la consola:




npm init

Crea un archivo package.json por defecto (manera rápida):




npm init --yes
npm init -y

Tanto npm init --yes como npm init -y hacen lo mismo.
2. Instalar una dependencia localmente

                    <span>Warning! We&#x27;re going to see some Functional Programming concepts like pure functions, side effects etc. and obviously higher order functions.
In the last post, we saw how we can create a middleware wrapper that can wrap any function and make it an express middleware.
//withMiddleware.js

//Higher Order Function
const withMiddleware &#x3D; (func) &#x3D;&gt; {
  return (req, res, next) &#x3D;&gt; {
    func(); //func has the EXECUTION LOGIC
    next();
  }    
}

module.export &#x3D; withMiddleware;

And we can use it in this way
const withMiddleware &#x3D; require(&#x27;./withMiddleware&#x27;);

const funcOne &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
  //YOUR BUSINESS LOGIC
}

const funcTwo &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {

                    <span>Sometimes it&#x27;s convenient to have one Next.js codebase serve multiple discrete sites. The sites might have different content and design but also share code - such as having the same React component to render the header or sidebar.
A typical example could be a web development agency that wants to put multiple customers on a shared platform, or a media house serving multiple brands.
This post aims to be an overview of methods to share code between multiple related Next.js projects.

                    <span>The internet of things (IoT) remains a popular subset of the information technology (IT) realm. However, despite its advancements, IoT is still in its infancy. By 2027, the global IoT market is estimated to be worth over $1,463.19 billion USD. 
With massive leaps in IoT technology and a rapidly changing landscape, IoT security is a budding concern. Here&#x27;s what you need to know about IoT security.

IoT security is tough to implement. A major contributing factor is the complexity of IoT and its many factors. Instead of the back end, there&#x27;s network security and physical device security to consider as well.
The current landscape values ease of use over security. As Manuel Pais points out in DZone&#x27;s guide to IoT, there&#x27;s an onus on plug-and-play capability. This prioritizes operability and usa…</span>

Partial is great if you want to create an object with some of the values from a given interface. However when the object is used (via property access or through some consuming type), the object still is a Partial - as in all properties are optional, even if you have provided a value.

In these cases, what we really want is a Picked object - an object with the properties we want &quot;picked&quot; out of the original interface.

                    <span>Hey guys 👋👋👋
In this article, I will write how to generate dynamic Open Graph images with Next.js and TypeScript on Vercel.
For example, the OGI of https://ogp-sample.vercel.app/hoge is like below. (Sorry that I developed this app in Japanese, but you will see the OGI has this site&#x27;s path name: &#x27;hoge&#x27;.)

If you change the path to &#x27;fuga&#x27; like https://ogp-sample.vercel.app/fuga, the OGI is like below.

You will see the OGI is automatically generated by the path name of URL.

Angular has allowed us to polyfill features back to browsers like IE 9, 10, and 11 for a while using the polyfills.ts file. With the introduction of Angular CLI 7.3 we get conditional polyfills, where we only ship the older polyfills to pre-ES2105 browsers. This results in a savings of about 56Kb. This won’t take you from average to superhero load times, but this is an easy optimization.
If you’re starting a new project, just make sure you have at least @angular/cli@7.3.0 installed globally via npm and ng new away!
If you have an older project there are a few more steps. Here is the outline:
Upgrade global CLI to 7.3
Upgrade project to CLI 7.3
Delete IE polyfills from polyfills.ts

Add flag to angular.json

Validate it’s working

In this article I would like to talk about an often-used feature on a user-centric application - the scroll-to-top button for allowing a user to quickly scroll to the top of the page, without having to use the mouse. The end result would be something like this:

Let&#x27;s break up this implementation into 3 steps:
✔️ Set up the scroll-to-top button (with some nice styling).
I have used @angular/material for some easy styling. In order to display the button fixed to the bottom-right corner of the page (and some nice hover effects with opacity), I have used the below properties on the :host -

This is an interesting section. To begin with, we need to set up an Observable on the scroll event of the DOCUMENT. You may directly access the document object, or you may use an InjectionToken, provided by angular.
This observable starts emitting values as soon as the user starts to scroll up or down. Now we are not really interested in the actual scroll event, but we would like to check something important every time the scroll event is fired - and that is the scroll position. Angular makes this quite simple with the ViewportScroller service from @angular/common package. This service has few useful methods, and I am going to use two of them - getScrollPosition and scrollToPosition.

The getScrollPosition method returns an array of 2 numbers - the X and Y coordinate. I check if the Y coordinate is more than 0 (which means the user has scrolled down) and I enable the scroll-to-top button.
For this last part, I make use of the scrollToPosition method, which again takes in the X and Y coordinates, and I scroll to [0, 0].

                    <span>Reactive programming in angular in the most basic form is the adoption of RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) to angular application development. RxJS is a powerful library adopted in Angular that makes asynchronous operations super easy. 
This article focuses on revealing to you the juice of reactive programming by providing you a reactive approach to solving one of the most common real world problems encounted by angular developers. 
Enough of the long talks, lets get our hands dirty...
Imagine you were assigned a task to create a users table(mat-table) that is populated mainly by making an asynchronous call to an endpoint that returns a list of users. The table should:
Have on it server side pagination.

                    <span>Worried about the nearing EOL(End of Life) of AngularJS?
AngularJS has already entered its Long Term Support (LTS) period, on July 1, 2018, which was expected to end in June 2021. However, before the companies could migrate from AngularJS to Angular, the pandemic arrived and disturbed all the arrangements. In light of the fact, AngularJS has extended the EOL for 6 more months i.e. till December 31, 2021,  after which AngularJS will not be providing support to the framework. It’s time to brace yourself for the change and upgrade from AngularJS to Angular.

                    <span>Introduction


Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
Bootstrap is an open source CSS framework with many components for building responsive WEB interfaces.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the application with the Angular base structure using the @angular/cli with the route file and the SCSS style format.
ng new angular-bootstrap
? Would you like to add Angular routing? Yes
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? SCSS   [ https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss                ]

                    <span>Today we are going to cover everything you need to know about the Scale Set Agents in Azure Pipelines, and how to use them to make your builds more elastic and flexible.
As usual, if you are a visual learner, or simply prefer to watch and listen instead of reading, here you have the video with the whole explanation and demo, which to be fair is much more complete than this post.

If you rather prefer reading, well... let&#x27;s just continue :)
So, Scale Set Agents in Azure Pipelines.
As the name says those are agents that you can install and run in Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, or VMSS.
As such, they can be scaled horizontally automatically, to make your build faster, more elastic, and eventually more flexible.

                    <span>Kubernetes has become the name of the game when it comes to container orchestration. It allows teams to deploy and scale applications to meet changes in demand while providing a great developer experience.
The key to handling modern dynamic, scalable workloads in Kubernetes is a networking stack that can deliver API management, a service mesh and an ingress controller. Kong Ingress Controller allows users to manage the routing rules that control external user access to the service in a Kubernetes cluster from the same platform.
This article will look at how you can use Kong for full-stack application deployments with Kubernetes. By full-stack, we mean Kong can handle:

                    <span>The popularity and demand of running containers in development is increasing day by day. The advantages of running containers over using the traditional methods of virtualization are known to all. But where does the data in the running container go. Let&#x27;s find out!
If we look at the image below-

There is a local machine which has a container running on it&#x27;s memory, and it wants to access data somewhere on the disk.
There are two ways by which docker allows us to do this-
Persisting state option 1- Blind mounts
Persisting state option 2- Volumes
Let us have a look at both of the methods-
If we look at the diagram above, on it&#x27;s left side, it shows a container on the RAM, which is accessing a mount on the DISK. This is a kind of quick way to access data on the disk of the machine.

After getting into volumes Click on Create Volume


Make sure you select the current available zone of which your instance is running.Select the additional volume size

Successfully volume created now it is available to attach to any instance

Now select additional volume and click on attach then select Attach Volume

Select the instance that you want to attach and click on attach 

Now volume status will be in-use

Now connect to your instance using ssh and execute following cmd
# sudo fdisk -l

you can see 

Its not enough that attaching a volume doesn&#x27;t make that additional volume usable.
# sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf

# mkdir myfolder
# sudo mount /dev/xvdf myfolder/


Now it is successfully attached and we can use it for read and write operations

Unmount additional volume
# umount myfolder/

Don&#x27;t detach additional volume directly from EBS please unmount it in specific instance
you can cross-check again 

Now go to the EBS volumes tab and select additional volume and detach it 

Now the detached volume will be available for use and data created in it will be also persisted and we can also attach it to another running instance 

Note: Please don&#x27;t use this below cmd if you want data to be persisted while attaching the volume to another instance
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf
If you use the above cmd again means data will be erased 
just use below cmds and mount the additional volume in any instance
# mkdir myfolder
# sudo mount /dev/xvdf myfolder/</span>

                    <span>Managing infrastructure on the cloud these days can be done in numerous ways, tools like Terraform, Pulumi, Cloudformation, and CDK have propelled the area of Infrastructure as Code(IaC) into new heights. While most of these tools require some basic programming knowledge or even learning new languages, like Terraform HCL, the true power lies in building a platform using these tools.
When building infrastructure, as infrastructure developers we tend to create it in ways where the author can create a new infrastructure easily, but not the remainder of the organization. This usually happens when as engineers we think the tool is built only for &quot;us&quot;, however this can be avoided by thinking about infrastructure as a product where our customer is the engineering team as a whole, this helps in en…</span>

I am learning Linux extensively from past couple of years which is helping me to learn more several Linux based tools. One of the frequent command is top among system administratots and engineers.
What is top command?
top command displays the Linux processes on the host. Here is the definition from the manual:
The top program provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system. It can display system summary information as well as a list of processes
or threads currently being managed by the Linux kernel. The types of system summary information shown and the types, order and size of information displayed for processes are all user configurable and that configuration can be made persistent across restarts.

For many people, the Linux command line can be a scary place. It looks different and feels different than what they&#x27;re used to. But I like to think of it as a tool that allows you to do very specific things, like nothing else can.

In the Linux command line, you type a command and get output in the same window. There are hundreds of commands and it can take a long time to master them. You can practice Linux and quickly master all the commands online.

                    <span>The text editor I use daily is called vim (vi improved). It’s not a program for everybody, but it suits my needs well.
Vim is one of the most powerful text editor that exists. It&#x27;s a program that you can configure to make it do anything. It has a steep learning curve, and can take months or years to master. 
Vim can be used without the mouse, everything using key presses. My first experience with vi was really bad (I forgot everything about it) but once I got used to it and learned a couple of commands and a few ex commands I fell in love with vi.
You could wonder, when writing code why use a mouse at all?
Once you know the vim commands it&#x27;s very easy to use. It&#x27;s a great bonus that it can be used in the terminal, because it lets you quickly edit your system files or edit files remotely using ssh.
I was a fairly experienced computer user. I started using a computer around age 12 or so, taught myself basic programming when I was about 13, and eventually became rather adept at various aspects of the art of computing.

I found myself needing to do a lot of system administration, and in the past I would have used nano, but I decided to try vim. I’d heard good things about it in the past but had never really tried it, so I was curious.
Here are some reasons I switched to vi/vim : 
1) It is extremely fast 
Vim is probably installed on your computer, if you open a terminal you can type
$ vim

And to exit press ZQ. If in the rare situation it&#x27;s not installed, it is available in your package manager. However, even on a commercial OS like Mac OS X vim is available by default.
If you are new to vim, you can practice here</span>

I do now have the vantage point I needed to move forward in a better direction. I scrapped months of work and PrEP trying to make something work that clearly wasn&#x27;t in the cards.
It&#x27;s a crypto-network not based on exit scams, tv personalities plugging stuff or general bad financial advice. Digital currencies are an inevitability and we have to accept the fact that we cannot physically print enough money to account for our debt.

                    <span>In the past, I had already written two articles related to this topic. One was how to upload images to Cloudinary and the other was how to compress images with Node.js.
Today I decided to combine the knowledge from those articles. That is, I decided to compress the images and upload them to Cloudinary.
In this way, they will only spend credits on the space of the images and not on their compression and transformation.
Despite explaining step by step what we are going to do today, I recommend you go read the articles I mentioned.
Now with the introduction done, let&#x27;s code!
First let&#x27;s install the necessary dependencies:
npm install express multer cloudinary sharp

Now we need a basic API:

npm run develop watches config files


In previous versions of Foal, the develop command did not restart the server when a configuration file was changed. This was annoying and is the reason why, starting with v2.5, new projects generated by the CLI will watch configuration files.
createOpenApiDocument accepts an optional serviceManager


If you use createOpenApiDocument, in a shell script for example, the function accepts an optional serviceManager parameter from this version.
This can be useful if your OpenAPI decorators access controller properties whose values are manually injected.</span>

                    <span>Recently, I migrated a project I&#x27;ve been working on to TypeScript. I decided to use Webpack in combination with esbuild loader. The reason being esbuild ecosystem is still relatively new when compared to other bundlers like Webpack, rollup, parcel etc. in terms of plugins and loaders.
Code for this article is available here.




I&#x27;ve also made a video for you, if you&#x27;re a visual learner like me!
At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. Basically it takes all your code, assets, dependencies and bundles them into static files that are easier to work with and deploy. You can read more about it here
esbuild is an extremely fast JavaScript bundler, upto 10-100x fast. You can check the benchmark and read more here.

                    <span>📘 How to securely access secrets stored in the #Azure Key Vault service using the new Azure #SDK and managed #identities.



  
  
  
TL;DR: Managing secrets and credentials used to secure communication between the different components of a cloud solution can be challenging for developers. This can be simplified with managed identities available in the Microsoft Azure cloud. Let&#x27;s see how to deal with secrets management in ASP .NET Core applications hosted on the Azure cloud.
Managing secrets in cloud solutions can be a big challenge. Whether it&#x27;s a database password or a connection string to access a specific service — these values should be stored securely. In the Microsoft Azure cloud, there is a dedicated service called Azure Key Vault. It is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets. When thinking about secrets, we should have in mind that they can be in many different forms. A database password is a secret, a certificate is a secret, and a cryptographic key is also considered a secret.
Storing secrets in places like a configuration file can expose our application to vulnerabilities similar to the ones due to bad programming practices or bugs. Many developers struggle with managing secrets properly and looking for a solution to test the application locally without worrying about secrets management after deployment. This is where Azure Key Vault and Azure managed identities can help.
In this article, we will explore how to set up Azure Key Vault, store the secret in it, and access this secret from the ASP .NET Core application using Azure managed identity. We will learn how to combine using secrets locally and access them after the deploying to the Azure cloud.

Passwordless authentication is the process of verifying a software user’s identity with something other than a password. The most common passwordless authentication methods include verifying the possession of a secondary device or account a user has or a biometric trait that is unique to them, like their face or fingerprint.
Passwordless authentication can reduce costs and security risks for any organization. And as Google Cloud’s director of product management Sam Srinivas explains, passwordless authentication usage will likely grow rapidly in the near future.

                    <span>Enumerations are an awesome feature of typescript, you can create a set of distinct cases with numeric or string-based enums.
For example, if you&#x27;re working on a game of cards and figure out you could actully use enum to define the suits:
enum Suit {
  Clubs &#x3D; &#x27;♣️&#x27;,
  Spades &#x3D; &#x27;♠️&#x27;,
  Diamonds &#x3D; &#x27;♦️&#x27;,
  Hearts &#x3D; &#x27;♥️&#x27;,
}

Now, if you have a collection of objects and each object in the collection has a value represented by an enum, you can actually write a pretty neat function to split it into smaller collections, each limited to a certain enum value. In our case we could split a deck of cards into clubs, spades, diamods and hearts correspondently.
For the sake of simplicity our deck will have only 4 cards, namely 4 aces, one from each suit, here&#x27;s our small deck:

                    <span>Version 2.5 of Foal has been released! Here are the improvements that it brings.
npm run develop watches config files


In previous versions of Foal, the develop command did not restart the server when a configuration file was changed. This was annoying and is the reason why, starting with v2.5, new projects generated by the CLI will watch configuration files.
createOpenApiDocument accepts an optional serviceManager


If you use createOpenApiDocument, in a shell script for example, the function accepts an optional serviceManager parameter from this version.
This can be useful if your OpenAPI decorators access controller properties whose values are manually injected.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, End To End testing has become a regular topic of discussion in small team environments. The main reasons for this are the evolution of tooling and the need to shift towards high velocity product development. At Clerk , we use End To End testing to create bulletproof authentication flows across browsers.
In the past, End To End testing was almost exclusively considered a Quality Assurance Engineering topic. For one reason or another, the development of test automation pipelines and application workflow validation tests were not so popular with software engineers.
That view has gradually become dated and replaced with the growing popularity of tools like Cypress, Puppeteer, Playwright, and even the latest version of Selenium.

The growth of those tools should not be seen as …</span>

                    <span>Recently, I migrated a project I&#x27;ve been working on to TypeScript. I decided to use Webpack in combination with esbuild loader. The reason being esbuild ecosystem is still relatively new when compared to other bundlers like Webpack, rollup, parcel etc. in terms of plugins and loaders.
Code for this article is available here.




I&#x27;ve also made a video for you, if you&#x27;re a visual learner like me!
At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. Basically it takes all your code, assets, dependencies and bundles them into static files that are easier to work with and deploy. You can read more about it here
esbuild is an extremely fast JavaScript bundler, upto 10-100x fast. You can check the benchmark and read more here.

PropTypes provide built-in typechecking capabilities when writing a React app. Checking the type of prop in a React component in a large application helps catch bugs at run-time.
Typically in a React app, you will need to install the package yarn add prop-types. Then, inside a component, explicitly define the type of a prop.
import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import PropTypes from &#x27;prop-types&#x27;;

// A component that accepts &quot;color&quot; prop
function FavoriteColor({ color }) {
  return 
My favorite Color is {color}
;
}

FavoriteColor.propTypes &#x3D; {
  color: PropTypes.string
};

// Parent component
function App() {
  return (

}

                    <span>TypeScript can be difficult to understand for many developers. One area causing troubles are advanced types. Part of this area are utility types built in TypeScript. They can help you create new types from existing. In this article, you will learn how some of these utility types work and how to use them.
TypeScript provides a powerful system for working with types. There are the basic types you already know from JavaScript. For example, types such as number, string, boolean, object, symbol, null, undefined. This is not all TypeScript offers. On top of these types are also built-in utility types.
It is sometimes also these utility types that can be the most difficult to understand for developers coming to TypeScript. This is especially true when you see these types for the first time. The g…</span>

                    <span>A simple POC where Angular requests the URL of an image to the Quarkus back end and then renders the image in the screen. Quarkus returns the image in two ways: (1) a simple copy from the URL of the image; (2) the image encoded in Base64 with the Media Type.
The project is available on GitHub poc-http-copy-images.

Let&#x27;s imagine a hypothetical situation where only the backend have access to the URL of some images and you want to render these images on the frontend.
In this POC, I propose two ways of solving this problem:
The backend access the URL of the image and expose the same Response object;
The backend access the URL of the image, encode it into Base64 and expose it into a JSON object with the Media Type.
Optionally, you can run a Quarkus mock server which will provide three endpoints with the below images:
http://localhost:8090/image/earth.png
http://localhost:8090/image/moon.jpg
http://localhost:8090/image/solarsystem.svg
*** Optionally, because you can choose any image from the internet to run the test.
Enter inside the mock-server folder and type:
$ mvn quarkus:dev -Ddebug&#x3D;5006

The swagger will be available at:
http://localhost:8090/q/swagger-ui

Enter inside the quarkus folder and type:
$ mvn quarkus:dev -Ddebug&#x3D;5006

The swagger will be available at:
http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui

Enter inside the angular folder and type:
$ npm install
$ ng serve

The front end will be available at:
http://localhost:4200/
Ok, in this screen, just put the URL of any image you desire (of the mock or the internet) and click on Load Image:

After clicking in the button, the image will be displayed in two columns, the left one is the raw copy from the URL and the right one is the Base64 version:

Any new image searched will be shown and the previous ones will slide down:</span>

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id&#x3D;
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube&#x27;s policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
