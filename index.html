                    <span>November 2021, seems that pandemic situation is still not getting better but on the other hand several frontend or javascript focused conferences provide online attendance. So, why not visit the Italian one and meet several known and impressive people from the dev community :-)
AngularDay


This Italian Angular international conference was organized by GrUSP community on November 12th 2021. The event happened online, on Hopin easy-to-use web platform for conferences.
There were various known speakers from the Angular community and also the official Angular Core Team joined (Emma Twersky, Mark Thompson, Jessica Janiuk) in the last part.
The atmosphere of the conference was easy going and was moderated by Giulia Tosato, Tomas Trajan and also Tracy Lee joined in the last part.

                    <span>Motion One is a new animation library built on the Web Animations API. If you have used Popmotion or Greensock before, this library&#x27;s syntax should look very familiar.
In this blog post, I will show you how to use Motion One in an Angular application. I will walk you through the installation process, create a simple animation, and use Motion One&#x27;s spring and timeline features.
Check out a live demo I&#x27;ve created that you can interact with as part of my Angular Animation Explorer.
First, we will need to add Motion One&#x27;s dependency via npm using the following command.
npm install --save motion

If you run into any typings issue from the library, try adding skipLibCheck: true to your tsconfig.json.

To animate an element from your template, you will need to give it an id so you can access them…</span>

                    <span>Schematics are very useful. They provide us to achieve more in a shorter amount of time. But most significantly used, we can think less about routine stuff which leaves our limited attention span to focus on solving real changes.
Ensure that you have the following packages installed at a global level on your computer. Note that in a real-life development context, you should have some of these local to your project. But for the having well been stable development environment we will install them globally.
node v12.8.0 npm v.6.10.2 @angular-cli (core y cli) v.10 @schematics/angular @schematics/schematics@0.1000.5
This allows us to use the schematics command and specifically the blank schematics to generate a new schematics project where we can start implementing our custom schematics.

                    <span>This blog is a helpful resource for deciding which solution is best for you: Angular vs React vs Vue JavaScript framework.
If you’re a developer just starting out on a project and can’t decide which JavaScript framework to use, this guide should help.
React is a user interface library, Angular is a front-end framework, and Vue.js is a progressive framework.
They can be used almost interchangeably to build front-end applications, but they are not identical, so it is important to compare them and understand their differences.
Each framework is component-based, allowing for the rapid development of UI features.
In this segment, we’ll look at various aspects of Angular, Vue, and React to see how they can meet your needs. This post is not just a comparison of Angular vs. React vs. Vue, but it a…</span>

In order to allow Spacelift to manage Azure resources, we need to do the following:
Create a Service Principal in Azure with the correct ARM permissions to manage our resources.
Create a Stack in Spacelift that uses the Azure provider.
Give our Stack the credentials for our Service Principal.

You realized the complexity of this project around the same time as you discovered that there’s not a lot of information online on how to do it. Companies like LinkedIn, Uber, and Slack have large teams of over 25 employees working just on notifications, but smaller companies like yours don’t have that luxury. So how can you meet the same level of quality with a team of one? This is the third post in our series on how you, a developer, can build or improve the best notification system for your company. It follows the first post about identifying user requirements and designing with scalability and reliability in mind. In this piece, we will learn about setting up routing and preferences.

                    <span>As the tech world changes, language changes with it. New technologies will always introduce new terms and descriptions to provide clear understanding. For example, the emergence of the cloud introduced language to describe the changing relationship between servers and clients. Then, of course, product providers will also dictate how their products are to be described, i.e. describing services as “cloud-native”.
On other occasions, language changes through deliberate effort to influence behavior. Thought leaders will often invent alternative words to describe existing ideas in order to effect cultural change. Even a slight change in diction can massively affect one’s engagement, attitude, and even their worldview. In this blog, we’ll look at how language colours how we perceive our environm…</span>

                    <span>It&#x27;s time we recognize that the way we build digital products is broken. That&#x27;s because the products we use today represent the people who build them more than the people who use them.
There is a digital divide between the experiences of people with disabilities and people who are able-bodied. Bridging this divide is about more than compliance or checking a box.
Fable is helping companies practice accessibility at scale with the goal of operationalizing accessibility in the same way we already do for things like DesignOps and DevOps.
Listen as Fable&#x27;s CEO and Co-founder, Alwar Pillai, and Fable&#x27;s Engineering Manager, Perry Trinier, talk about the importance of inclusive design, the need for digital accessibility and how to integrate accessibility into the development process.

                    <span>Originally published to dakotalewallen.me
A lot of grey area exists between SAM and the CDK. SAM makes it nice to verify things locally before pushing out to AWS, CDK doesn&#x27;t provide anything other than seeing your initial stack. So the dev process for the cdk looks like, read docs -&gt; write js -&gt; deploy to CloudFormation (typically a few minutes for anything more than a s3 bucket) -&gt; manually verify  -&gt; repeat. Not a fast process at all. Honestly if you could just take the support for local debugging from SAM and give it to the CDK it&#x27;d be near perfect.
CDK documentation is pretty confusing. Somewhat understandable given how young it is, but still. Also doesn&#x27;t help that a lot of the guides that exist are also outdated. Some even coming from AWS themselves. There&#x27;s also a lot modules in th…</span>

                    <span>As developers, we often want to build faster, but that comes with tradeoffs that we have to deal with in the long run. At PlanetScale, we want to empower developers to be able to build without having to worry about issues of database scalability as their application grows. Similarly, Prisma wants to empower developers to efficiently work with data while making fewer errors. 
PlanetScale and Prisma have partnered up to allow developers to create PlanetScale databases in the new Prisma Data Platform. You can have a starter database schema and a live PlanetScale database ready to accept thousands of new database connections with a few clicks.
The Prisma Data Platform provides you with application templates with Prisma data schemas, so you don&#x27;t even have to think about a data model to get started. Once set up, you can deploy to Vercel immediately or use the Prisma Data Explorer and Query Builder to explore your PlanetScale database.
Try out creating your first PlanetScale database with one of the application templates and experience the power of Prisma with PlanetScale for yourself.</span>

I&#x27;ve been fairly extensively using conda for a while now, ditching the old pip + virtualenv habbit of mine, since I&#x27;m collaborating with people on a common source code instead of freelancing by myself like the old days, and therefore this question has come to my mind and gone every few weeks.
Have I chosen the correct dependency manager?
A little background: Miniconda + conda environments (yml files) have been a good fit so far. Our projects are products focusing on datascience solutions, and we develop the data science microservice of the product. But we&#x27;re still in the heavy exploration phase, and have not really stabilized the &quot;MLOps&quot; loop.
So back to the question.
I see many have advocated for the use of Poetry. Can someone explain to me the pros and cons of each approach? Why poetry seems so loved by many, and when should someone consider switching from conda to poetry?
Thanks!</span>

                    <span>As Kubernetes Pods don&#x27;t store data persistently, it offers different storage components to prevent this data loss. In this blog, learn how Volume works in Kubernetes, how to create it, and how to attach it to the Pod.

Before exploring Kubernetes volumes, let’s first understand Docker. Docker containers are meant to be transient, which means they will only last for a short period. They are called upon when required to process data and are destroyed once finished.
The same is true for the data within the container. The data is destroyed along with the container. To persist data processed by the container, we attach a volume to the containers created. Now even if the container is deleted, the data generated or processed by it remains.
Now let’s look at how it works in the case of Kubernetes…</span>

Tron (Tron Network, Tron Blockchain) was introduced back in 2018 by Justin Sun, an eccentric Chinese American entrepreneur. Tron is developed and maintained by a Singapore-incorporated non-profit Tron Foundation established in July 2017.
At its core, Tron is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain built around native cryptocurrency Tronics (TRX). It works not unlike BitShares (BTS) or Eos (EOS): tokenholders lock their tokens in favour of validators in order to share transactional fees with them.

  Full instructions are here


To install Certbot, you should have Snap installed as well. For instructions, follow this tutorial.

Then, update snap
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
To use Certbot you should have server_name in your Ngnix config. For example, this is a sample of how my Nginx config file looked like before Certbot.
server{
        root /home/pi/website;
        server_name example.slashtechno.com;
}

Once you have the config set up properly, restart nginx. On most systems it will be the following command.

You can basically utilize the bundle administrator of any famous Linux circulation you are rushing to introduce the unfasten bundle.

  How to Unzip Files in Linux?


When we run the unzip command without any options, in the most native form, it simply extracts all the files and directories inside the current directory that you are in.




Output Suppression
You can see that the unzip command enlists the details of the files that it is extracting from the archived file. To avoid printing the details and suppress the output, we can simply use the quiet (-q) option along with the unzip command.




If you want to extract them to a different directory, you can use the -d option and specify the path to the destination directory. Please note that if you don’t have write access to the destination directory, you can use the sudo command to get the root privileges.



If you want to unzip a file that is password-protected, you can use the -P option along with the unzip command.




However, typing the password as plain text in the terminal (command line) could be insecure. What you can do is simply extract the zipped file in a normal manner. When it tries to unzip the files and finds a file with a password, it will automatically prompt you to input the password.




To conclude this detailed and comprehensive article, we discussed how to unzip files in Linux using the unzip command.</span>

                    <span>This summer I was fortunate enough to be selected as linux foundation mentee for Vitess which is a CNCF graduated project. 
vitess.io
Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL through generalized sharding.
Sharding is the concept of breaking up data into smaller chunks distributed across separate database nodes.
My aim for the summer was to develop an exhaustive test suite for Vitess&#x27;s compatibility with Django&#x27;s model layer.
During this period, I was mentored by a team of engineers from Planetscale who are currently maintaining Vitess. I was part of daily stand-up meetings and was in constant touch with my mentors, who guided me through the whole project. Also I got a chance to be part of community-day for Vitess in which contributors and maintainers from all around the world interacted. 
Sadly, due to an unfortunate event I was unable to work for weeks. But my mentors and the admins at CNCF were kind enough to understand my situation and granted me an extension for the program. And with the help of my mentors i was able to complete the project within the extended deadline.
I learnt a lot during this mentorship program and will continue to contribute more to the project in future.</span>

                    <span>Reasons to use Linux


Linux has a better environment for programming. It can smoothly execute software like PyCharm, Rider and Android Studio. Linux has a huge source of tools to make a specific task easier. Not only aircrack-ng there are many other CLI based tools, that gonna help you. And one thing, docker also executes awesomely in Linux.
Linux has a growing software for video editing which might not fulfill all our requirements. Idiots in the Linux community quarrels over distro i.e. &quot;my distro is better&quot;, instead of coding a nice piece of software or staying silent. Image editing and other stuff can be tedious for you. I don&#x27;t see any point in using Wine, wine just decrease the GUI appearance of the app.
I use Ubuntu, Ubuntu is super awesome. Fool people quarrel over distros but that&#x27;s not what smart linux users do.
Most of the Linux distro arguments are about the desktop environments. You can literally install any desktop environment in any linux based OS you&#x27;re using. So, let&#x27;s not quarrel over Linux Distro (aka: Desktop Environment). 
Let&#x27;s contribute on making software and games for Linux. Let&#x27;s do it.</span>

                    <span>Creating a Postcard with Lob and Node.js


Lob’s Print &amp; Mail and Address Verification APIs enable developers to interact with Lob’s services programmatically. You can mail a postcard or letter to your customers at critical points in their journey as easily as you might send an email. These physical reminders help you keep in touch with clients, and encourage clients to keep purchasing your products and services.   
In this three-part tutorial, we’ll create a postcard template, verify our recipient’s address, send a postcard, and track it along its journey. We’ll create a Javascript application to do all this, so our users can access everything they need in one place.

                    <span>Here at Deepgram, we work with audio files all the time. We have SDKs that make it easy for developers to send audio files to our API. But it&#x27;s also really useful to know how to post an audio file to a backend server in case you ever find yourself needing to do that. So I thought I would introduce a simple way for Node developers to take an audio file that is uploaded through the browser and send it to a backend Express.js server.
Let&#x27;s start on the backend with our Express.js server. Express.js is a Node.js framework that provides us with so many useful methods and middleware, making working in Node that much easier.
We&#x27;ll set up the server and implement a middleware package called Multer that helps us handle different file types that we receive to our post endpoint.

At its core, Tron is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain built around native cryptocurrency Tronics (TRX). It works not unlike BitShares (BTS) or Eos (EOS): tokenholders lock their tokens in favour of validators in order to share transactional fees with them.

                    <span>Typescript 4.5 was just released and one of the features that stood out to me is the Template String Types as Discriminants. In this article, we are going to explore this new feature using rudimentary examples.  In my last article, we covered using discriminated unions to write better types that are easy to narrow. 
This is an extension of that but instead of having a concrete literal type, you can use a non-concrete literal type i.e. string, number, etc. instead as part of the template literal type, and Typescript will be able to use it as a discriminant.
In order to understand this feature, we are going to start by creating two types: SuccessType and ErrorType. They are going to represent possible responses for different operations we can perform in a computer system i.e. HTTP Request, F…</span>

                    <span>Having no idea what Node.js hosting requirements should be covered for your app?
Looking for the best Node.js hosting platform?
In this post, we’ll take in-depth look at all the aspects and subtleties you should analyse to choose the best option.
Also we’ll provide a step-by-step tutorial on how to get Node.js applications hosted in the cloud on the example of Ghost publishing platform.
Why Developers and Enterprises Prefer Node.js
JavaScript code is quite easy-to-understand even for non-professionals, as well as the open-source platform facilitates the application development process.
Moreover, the Node Package Manager includes tons of pre-built modules, which accelerate development speed even more. Scalability, reduced response time and the ability to use the same language on server and client sides are also the proven benefits of Node.js.
As for now most businesses and industries choose Node.js for building their projects. Such a runtime environment is perfect for modern applications because it scales quite well without additional investments into hardware.
REST APIs, real-time apps, single-pages and more can be easily built and executed on almost all known platforms.
Choosing the Best Node.js Hosting Provider
In this guidance, we’ll go through the main aspects you should weigh before choosing the right hosting platform.
Not all the providers support an event-driven JavaScript runtime environment and development framework, so you should do careful research to find the best Node.js hosting for your app.
First of all, you should realise if you have enough time and skills for the system administration routine. If yes, you can get some cloud VM or VPS and install, deploy and manage everything on your own. But, if you prefer to focus on application code than a managed cloud hosting platform would be a perfect choice.
Good luck ;-)</span>

I don&#x27;t always hate working using NPM unless it starts downloading tons of node_modules and giving not so verbose logs. Today, my colleague and I found an NPM login bug that&#x27;s not so interesting and hard to debug. It takes me about an hour to find out what is the root cause.
In this article, I will write the solution just in case you meet the same issue.
In my current company, we use Nexus3 as our private repository for the NPM module. I also use Node v12.22.4 and NPM v8.1.3 for working on my local machine. To login into our Nexus repository, I use .npmrc with this format:
@myorg:registry&#x3D;https://repo.myorg.com/repository/npm-private

Before we jump into the application, let&#x27;s look into the tools we are going to use.
Express is one of the most popular web frameworks for node.js. It is built on top of the node.js HTTP module and adds support for routing, middleware, view system, etc. It is very simple and minimal, unlike other frameworks that try to do way too much, thereby reducing the flexibility for developers to have their own design choices.

                    <span>Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) is one of the most common forms of broken access control which OWASP recently listed as the number one application security issue in 2021. A quick search for &quot;IDOR&quot; on Hacker One&#x27;s Hacktivity feed shows that many top tech companies (and even the U.S. Department of Defense) have fallen victim to IDOR, in some cases paying out well over $10,000 per bug bounty. In this post, I&#x27;ll explain what IDOR is, what causes it, and ways to protect your application against it.

Organizations apply AI tools to generate more value, increase revenue and customer loyalty. AI leading companies invest at least 20% of their earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in AI. This figure may increase as COVID-19 is accelerating digitization. Lockdowns resulted in a massive surge of online activity and an intensive AI adoption in business, education, administration, social interaction, etc.
This article aims to overview new and current AI trends that emerged in 2020 and are still increasing in 2021. Based on trends, companies can make projections of the AI future…</span>

                    <span>Read this article to find out what Windows features reduce the lifespan of your SSD and how to disable them. If your computer still uses a conventional HDD, it is high time to consider switching to a solid-state drive – SSD. It is going to add a significant boost to your computer or laptop.
Are SSDs so perfect? Well, not exactly. In comparison with HDDs, solid-state drives have certain advantages, the most prominent being the limited number of read/write cycles. It means that the number of erase/write cycles for SSDs is lower than for conventional hard disks. In today’s article, we will try to explain the cause for such deficiency and how you could avoid wearing out the disk more than needed.
The main component of a hard disk (HDD) is the platters where the information is actually written.…</span>

                    <span>In this tutorial we will make a password generator with the secrets module. Why not random module? see the first post in this series to understand.
So Let&#x27;s Begin!
Generate a random password, according to the user input.
Get user input
Create lists for letters etc...
Loop over lists and make a password.
Print the password.
Get user input
Here we will use try/except blocks so that when user types a string we do not get an error.
We will get inputs for number of special characters, small letters, big letters and numbers required for generating the password.
Code:
try:
        num_of_numbers &#x3D; int(input(&quot;How many numbers should your password have: &quot;))
except ValueError:

Before we begin though, let&#x27;s break apart Auth into its two sub-categories, Authentication and Authorization. Authentication is &quot;who you are&quot; while Authorization is &quot;what you are allowed&quot; to do. For this short article, we will be covering the latter of these two concepts.
Since GraphQL is a stateless API, it does not create sessions between the client and the API. The common method to authorize clients to query or mutate data is by passing a token known as a JSON Web token (JWT). The common way for a client to obtain a JWT is by authenticating through some auth provider who returns a JWT to the client. This JWT then provided by the client to the GraphQL API in th…</span>

A lot of grey area exists between SAM and the CDK. SAM makes it nice to verify things locally before pushing out to AWS, CDK doesn&#x27;t provide anything other than seeing your initial stack. So the dev process for the cdk looks like, read docs -&gt; write js -&gt; deploy to CloudFormation (typically a few minutes for anything more than a s3 bucket) -&gt; manually verify  -&gt; repeat. Not a fast process at all. Honestly if you could just take the support for local debugging from SAM and give it to the CDK it&#x27;d be near perfect.
CDK documentation is pretty confusing. Somewhat understandable given how young it is, but still. Also doesn&#x27;t help that a lot of the guides that exist are also outdated. Some even coming from AWS themselves. There&#x27;s also a lot modules in th…</span>

                    <span>Using React Material UI you have the opportunity to use any SVG file like an icon. To do so, you just wrap it into the SvgIcon component.
An example for your HomeIcon component might look like this:
import React from &#x27;react&#x27;;
import { SvgIcon, SvgIconProps } from &#x27;@mui/material&#x27;;
import { ReactComponent as HomeSvg } from &#x27;../../assets/Icons/Home.svg&#x27;;

function HomeIcon(props: SvgIconProps) {
  return (
    
  );
}

export default HomeIcon;

Importing svg files as react components required svgr, otherwise you would need to use the SVG code as children of SvgIcon
With SvgIcon you have the possibility to set the fontSize attribute to &quot;small&quot;, &quot;inherit&quot;, &quot;large&quot; or &quot;medium&quot;, but what if we if we would need more of this?





Here is where component variants come into play.
In our theme we just add a new variant to the MuiSvgIcon component. E.g. we we want an new size called huge we do it like this:
components: {
   MuiSvgIcon: {
      variants: [
        {
          props: { fontSize: &#x27;huge&#x27; },
          style: {
            fontSize: &#x27;5rem&#x27;,
          },
        },
      ],
    },
}

That should already work, but when we are using typescript and setting it, the compiler will complain.


So we need to extend the interface for the component too:
declare module &#x27;@mui/material/SvgIcon&#x27; {
  interface SvgIconPropsSizeOverrides {
    huge: true;
  }
}

Just add the above module declaration e.g. to your theme.ts  and that&#x27;s it.</span>

As shown in the picture, onion architecture is a way to structure the code by dividing it into domain-driven design layers. each layer can only access the layer below it throw its interfaces, and then using the dependency inversion principle each interface will be replaced with its class.

Onion Architecture leads to more maintainable applications since it emphasizes separation of concerns throughout the system.” Jeffery Palermo
NestJs is a service-side framework based on NodeJs. NestJs has many built-in features but most importantly for us now is the Dependency Injection and the possibility to add Dependency inversion which is what we need to apply the Onion Architecture.

In this article, we are going to explore this new feature using rudimentary examples.  In my last article, we covered using discriminated unions to write better types that are easy to narrow. 
This is an extension of that but instead of having a concrete literal type, you can use a non-concrete literal type i.e. string, number, etc. instead as part of the template literal type, and Typescript will be able to use it as a discriminant.
In order to understand this feature, we are going to start by creating two types: SuccessType and ErrorType. They are going to represent possible responses for different operations we can perform in a computer system i.e. HTTP Request, F…</span>

The @angular-eslint repo includes a number of linting rules that can help enforce accessibility best practices within Angular component templates.
It is important to note, however, that these rules do not check attributes and roles set using the host section of the @Component decorator, or ones set using @HostBinding decorators.
While passing these rules isn&#x27;t a guarantee or metric for ensuring full accessibility, it is a step in the right direction.
For convenience, I&#x27;ve divided the rules I will be covering into three groups. The first group, general, covers ARIA roles and attributes. The second group, content, includes rules related to textual rep…</span>

Slice Pipe



  
  
  Determine character max overflow limit



Determine max overflow by number of characters (instead of max-width)
Example: max overflow characters 20 (inclusive, aka 20 or more)
I use slice pipe where you add the start and end of the slice to the interpolated string






  {{ item.name | slice: 0 : 20 }}

Conditional span is based on data&#x27;s length

It is not a good practice to load thousands of records at once on one page, and there are many benefits to implement infinite scrolling.
Increase the time on our web site so that we can have faster operations
Make it easy to increase the depth of the page
The minimum number of clicks required
Better user interface
Best in mobile layout
One of the major advantages is that it reduces the bounce rate of a website
To implement infinite scrolling in Angular, we can use an npm package named ngx-infinite-scroll.

  Purpose


The purpose of this article is to utilize NX workspace to create both a native application and a web application using the monorepo pattern. The application will track the grocery list items you create. In the application, you will create a grocery list. After creating the grocery list, you will be able to open the application either as a web application or as a native application to see when the items were purchased. You will also be able to mark the item as used. Finally, you will receive a notification when you open the app if you have a perishable item that has not been yet been used and was purchased more than 3 days ago.  You can see the code we use for this article on my Github.

                    <span>There are certain types of data that we will pull into our applications that do not change, or that change very, very slowly. In these cases, it’s best to load the data into the application once, when it’s needed, and not to ask for it again until the application has been refreshed, or until we decide that we should get the data anew for some other reason.
In my Angular application, I’m using resolvers to pre-fetch any data needed for a route before sending the application to that route. One bit of data that is not likely to change, or will at least change very slowly, would be my repository of state/province data. Though it’s technically POSSIBLE that the U.S. could lose or gain a state, it’s also very unlikely. Therefore, I’d rather cache that data locally in my Angular application the f…</span>

This article is intended for intermediate level website developers and software engineers. I&#x27;ve tried to make it approachable for beginners but it&#x27;s really not for absolute beginners.
Website authentication can be a very confusing topic. There are a lot of considerations when thinking about an authentication system for your web projects. It&#x27;s overwhelming because authentication can be extremely simple or it can be a layer cake of individual systems that each build on top of each other.
In this series we&#x27;re going to start with no authentication and then you&#x27;ll add a very basic authentication system. Then you&#x27;ll progressively add and remove layers on top of it to make it a full b…</span>

                    <span>How we expanded customer choice while building a security-first architecture.



  
  
  
Choice is good. We like it when our supermarket shelves are stocked with hundreds of varieties of breakfast cereal. We pick the smartphones we use and the cars we drive. The same should be true for businesses and the technologies they use.
Today, we brought the Auth0 Identity Platform to Microsoft Azure, giving our private cloud customers the ability to pick the right infrastructure provider for their needs.
This means a greater selection of regions. Microsoft currently operates in over 60 regions around the world, making it easier to comply with data residency and sovereignty requirements.
And if you’re already running your app on Azure’s cloud servers, you’ll benefit from a converged infrastructure,…</span>

                    <span>We are on our way completing our project piece by piece. This week, we will adding test to our project. You might have wonder why would we need a test if our program is running and not crashing? From my point of view, testing not only figure it out the bugs, make sure very branches is tested but also help you with the designing of your software. When making test for this week, I have to actually refactor my code a bit more so as to be able to test it out such as exposing proccessMarkdown() in html-maker so as to test it out
module.exports.processingFile &#x3D; processingFile;
module.exports.processMarkdown &#x3D; processMarkdown;

The test I have written is very simple since my program is still very small.

                    <span>A lot of ink has been spilled about configuration file formats. Popular formats like JSON, TOML, YAML, and XML each have their advantages and drawbacks. There&#x27;s an alternative that should be receiving more attention: Typescript!
Before getting into why Typescript is a compelling choice for config files, let&#x27;s review the common file formats used in a typical web application today:
XML: Back in the late 90s to mid 2000s this was king both as a messaging protocol and flat file format. It gets a bad rap, but there is a lot to like about XML as a config file format, including great tooling support and a robust schema definition language in XSD. 
JSON: Extremely common as a data interchange format in REST APIs, and also very popular as a config file format. For a lot of developers this strikes t…</span>

                    <span>Problem: Conditional Ellipsis without CSS


I want to add an ellipsis to data that&#x27;s brought in from a service without having to use CSS&#x27; text-overflow: ellipsis feature, since it&#x27;s unreliable and could break overtime if not monitored during refactoring.
Slice Pipe



  
  
  Determine character max overflow limit



Determine max overflow by number of characters (instead of max-width)
Example: max overflow characters 20 (inclusive, aka 20 or more)
I use slice pipe where you add the start and end of the slice to the interpolated string






  {{ item.name | slice: 0 : 20 }}


span



Conditional span is based on data&#x27;s length

  Audience


This article is intended for intermediate level website developers and software engineers. I&#x27;ve tried to make it approachable for beginners but it&#x27;s really not for absolute beginners.
Website authentication can be a very confusing topic. There are a lot of considerations when thinking about an authentication system for your web projects. It&#x27;s overwhelming because authentication can be extremely simple or it can be a layer cake of individual systems that each build on top of each other.
In this series we&#x27;re going to start with no authentication and then you&#x27;ll add a very basic authentication system. Then you&#x27;ll progressively add and remove layers on top of it to make it a full b…</span>

                    <span>TL;DR - Rename your directory build something else
Makefile
build:
    docker build . -t my-basic-app

Look. I have the most basic app, Dockerfile and Makefile. Why can&#x27;t it just run make build command properly as I defined in Makefile?
shyamajp@ubuntu:~/Projects/my-basic-app$ make build
make: &#x27;build&#x27; is up to date.

Let&#x27;s get rid of this stupid error. At the root level, you must have a directory named build. That&#x27;s why you see this unexpected behavior.
In my case, I can change outDir name from build to dist to avoid this specific conflict.
tsconfig.json
{
    &quot;outDir&quot;: &quot;dist&quot;
}

Do not name your directory same as Makefile target. Be careful with names like build and test, which are often used for both Makefile targets and directory names.
I know this is a noob question but I&#x27;ve done it a few times already and I thought I might as well document it somewhere for myself. I hope this helps other newbie folks like me.

                    <span>Getting Start template! 👉 https://github.com/laststance/vite-react-ts-extended
This year there has been a big movement in build tools in the JavaScript community.

In 2020, Webpack, especially in combination with Babel, seemed to be the de facto standard for build tools.
However, in 2021, the popularity of a completely new development environment/build tool that does not include Webpack has skyrocketed.
Vite.
ESBuild that starts without build.
NPM Trend, you can see that Vite has overtaken the number of downloads of create-react-app since July.
The Next.js team has also responded by abandoning Babel and introducing SWC, an ultra-fast TypeScript compiler, in Next v12.
What does that mean for us React Developers?
The Vite default react-ts template lacked Jest and ESLint (Prettier integrated).
Jest comes pre-installed with React-Testing-Library, Hook-Testing-Library, MSW, and TypeScript support.
You can easily install and run Jest with the following commands, 
yarn
npx degit laststance/vite-react-ts-extended myapp
cd myapp
yarn install
yarn dev

npm
npx degit laststance/vite-react-ts-extended myapp
cd myapp
npm install
npm run dev

github: https://github.com/laststance/vite-react-ts-extended
so I would be happy if you could use it as a way to build a instant React+TypeScript development environment for new libraries or anything else! 💅</span>
