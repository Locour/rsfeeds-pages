                    <span>Hey Dev community! 😆
After weeks of exams and dealing with imposter syndrome, I am back with another short article on &#x27;file commands&#x27; in Linux. These are pretty useful so take a look. 🤠
The &#x27;cd&#x27; command moves you into any directory you want. For example, if I have files located in the &#x27;Documents&#x27; directory, this is the command I would run:
cd Documents
and this would move me to that directory.

The &#x27;ls&#x27; command lists everything that is in that directory. To list everything in the directory, run this command:
ls -l

the &#x27;cat&#x27; commands displays what is inside a file. Simply run this command:
cat (name of file)

The cat command also can do other things. 👇
Using this command, you can also create a file.
What I did below was I created the file, typed out what I needed to, then viewed the fil…</span>

Infinite Scroll is the ability to scroll through a large infinite list without compromising the performance of application. It improves user experience of the application. In this article I will cover how to implement infinite scroll with API in Angular 12 with the help of RxJS Operators.
A question comes in mind that how it works internally. It works like there is a big list say 10k items are there. Displaying all those items in once is not possible as it will break the application. And you can not put numbering pagination as that will look bad on the place or you have dropdown (dropdowns can not number paginations).
In that case you need infinite scroll. It loads only 10 (size is provided in configuration) r…</span>

Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
ng-recaptcha is a simple and configurable reCAPTCHA v2 and v3 component library.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the account. Access the site https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ and click on the button v3 Admin Console.

2. Fill in the field Email or phone and click on the button Next to login with your Google account and if you don&#x27;t have an account, just create a new account.

This article is a part of a series about how to create Generic CRUD Service &amp; Models in Angular:
Part 1 - Understanding Generics
Part 2 - What is CRUD?
Part 3 - Generic CRUD Model
👉 Part 4 - Generic CRUD Service in Angular




  
  
  Generic CRUD Service


Before we start generating and writing code, let’s take a step back and see the bigger picture. The generic service should accept the following arguments:
the HttpClient is used for the HTTP requests
the class of model for creating instances
the path of the API endpoints.
Also, all resources should have 5 main methods related to CRUD…
Create - Returns a new resource.
Get all - Retrieves all resources as a list.
Get by ID - Returns a specific resource by ID.
Update - Updates a specific resource by…</span>

The same happen with our users work with our angular apps, we show the component, but the data is not there or the HTTP request take time, and they are waiting.
A good solution is show a loading until get the data, but if my users want the beers ready from the beginning ? No problem because Angular have a solution, The Resolvers.
The Resolvers help us to prefetch data, before the router finish start the transition between components, and store.
The resolvers are helpful to avoid show an empty component, and  have our data ready, before move to the component.

As Kubernetes advances, is it time for us to explore different options that can support both DevOps and Developers in deploying and managing applications on Kubernetes?

Pulumi targets the widespread infrastructure as code (IaC) space but using a different approach.

A VPC is a Virtual Private Cloud and is very different from a VPN. As the name denotes, it is a private/isolated cloud hosted within a public cloud. It is a private space that gives you complete control over your virtual networking environment. It allows you to do several things, including selecting your own IP address, configuring route tables, network gateways, and creating your subnets.
To understand this concept better, try to imagine the public cloud as a famous coffee shop or eatery that is always crowded but has a table in an isolated corner that is always reserved. The table in this analogy refers to the VPC. Even though…</span>

Trivy is a simple and comprehensive scanner for vulnerabilities in container images, file systems, and Git repositories, as well as for configuration issues in IaC. Trivy detects vulnerabilities of OS packages (Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, etc.) and language-specific packages (Bundler, Composer, npm, yarn, etc.). In addition, Trivy scans Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files such as Terraform, Dockerfile and Kubernetes, to detect potential configuration issues that expose your deployments to the risk of attack.
You can scan your Terraform configuration artifacts easily giving you the confidence that all is well with your configuration before deploying your Terraform (IaC) configurations. It is a free/open source tool by AquaSecurity. For more information go check out th…</span>

The former is required to stay ahead of the curve (being better than one&#x27;s competitors) while the latter is the springboard to delivery. Thus, a strong platform is an apparent need for every technological company.
Thus, we land upon a concept called Platform Engineering.
As per this definition
Platform engineering is the process through which enterprises adopt (new technology and platforms), leverage (existing technologies and platforms), and transform (shift the dial on delivering value by transforming the way things are done) cloud platforms. It is at the core of designing, building, and operating your cloud infrastructure to deliver the next generation IT ecosystem.

So, I recently had to solve a problem with one of my NodeJS servers. I had to parse and process data from an excel sheet which turned out to be pretty CPU-intensive and it blocked the NodeJS event loop, effectively freezing my server till it&#x27;s done. I wasn&#x27;t surprised though; I expected this to happen. While there are several things you could do to resolve this, I&#x27;m going to present a solution using the NodeJS worker_threads module. Before we start, let&#x27;s quickly talk about this thread thing. The code used in this article is available here.

This is the second part of the node series; if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with node, don&#x27;t worry; we covered everything in the first series, which you can find it here &#x3D;&gt; dev.to/aviyel/node-js-from-beginners-to-advance
So, without further ado, let&#x27;s get this party started.
MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database application that is open source. MongoDB is a NoSQL database application that works with JSON-like documents and optional schemas. MongoDB is a database that was created by MongoDB Inc. and is distributed under the Server Side Public License.

                    <span>If you are already familiar with Docker and Docker Hub then in this post I’d like to introduce the Azure Container Registry which is an alternative to the well-known Docker Hub.
Things required before starting:
Docker Desktop
Azure CLI
Azure Account
In order to start with Azure Container Registry, you need an Azure account which you can create easily with FREE Credits and also ACR is a very cheap service. Once you logged into Azure, Navigate to Azure Container Registry by clicking on New --&gt; Search --&gt; type Azure Container Registry. After that create a new ACR by filling in all details you want to add but make sure you enable admin access. After Two or three minutes your ACR will be created.
Once you created a resource navigate Access Keys to get the Login server, Username, and password which is required for the command line push your local Docker image to ACR.

Type Above fig command and replace [login-server] with your ACR resource EG: firstapp.azureacr.io [username] with firstapp and [password] with the hash password. Once completed, you should see Login succeeded! Message. After this you need to build your docker image with this command
docker build –f ./Dockerfile . –t node_vue_app


Final step is to push your local Docker image to ACR. Follow below image command to push. Keep in mind though that these repositories are private by default, which means that you have to perform authentication first.

And that’s it. You can make use of this container registry just like you used. In Part 2 we will see how we can deploy same thing using CI/CD with GitHub Workflow</span>

                    <span>SOOO! For the last few weeks, with the help of other students in the course, my static site generator program has become very functional, but it has also grown in size and I was definitely in &quot;technical debt&quot;. It was high time to refactor the code base. 
Sit tight, because I have a lot to cover

Below are the steps I took to repay my &quot;technical debt&quot; 
Most of my operations related to any file path were done using regEx or string functions, for example:
else if(stat.isFile() &amp;&amp; filePath.split(&#x27;.&#x27;).pop() &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;txt&quot;) {
    createHtmlFiles(filePath, &quot;txt&quot;);

const fullFilePath &#x3D; &#x60;${outputPath}/${filePath.match(/([^\/]+$)/g)[0].split(&#x27;.&#x27;)[0]}.html&#x60;; 

They don&#x27;t look very readable, especially all the regular expressions. After working on others&#x27; code, I found that they used &#x27;path&#x27; module wh…</span>

Create a new project
Create a new directory in your local file system and switch to it by typing the following
mkdir encr_decr &amp;&amp; cd encr_decr
npm init -y

Now install the crypto module
npm install crypto --save

Now make app.js.
Add following code to app.js
var Crypto &#x3D; require(&#x27;crypto&#x27;);
var secret_key &#x3D; &#x27;fd85b494-aaaa&#x27;;
var secret_iv &#x3D; &#x27;smslt&#x27;;

Trivy is a simple and comprehensive scanner for vulnerabilities in container images, file systems, and Git repositories, as well as for configuration issues in IaC. Trivy detects vulnerabilities of OS packages (Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, etc.) and language-specific packages (Bundler, Composer, npm, yarn, etc.). In addition, Trivy scans Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files such as Terraform, Dockerfile and Kubernetes, to detect potential configuration issues that expose your deployments to the risk of attack.
You can scan your Terraform configuration artifacts easily giving you the confidence that all is well with your configuration before deploying your Terraform (IaC) configurations. It is a free/open source tool by AquaSecurity. For more information go check out th…</span>

Pulumi: Modern infrastructure as code for developers, a.k.a the new kid on the block.
Pulumi targets the widespread infrastructure as code (IaC) space but using a different approach. It allows developers to define infrastructure using their language of choice, such as TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and others, instead of a proprietary language, such as HCL, from our friends at HashiCorp.

                    <span>Are &quot;else&quot; statements really necessary? When first learning to program we are taught about &quot;if&quot; statements and &quot;else&quot; statements. If this condition is met do something, else do another thing. It&#x27;s fundamental to nearly every programming language, but can we ditch the &quot;else&quot; statement?
Like with most things in programming there will be scenarios where using an &quot;else&quot; statement is more appropriate than avoiding it, but let&#x27;s assume that we want to ditch it no matter what scenario arises. How would we do that and why would we want to?
The best way to explore this approach is through examples so let&#x27;s start with a simple one. All of the examples below are written in Typescript:

Coleções são, em resumo, uma representação de um grupo de objetos. Uma coleção iterável é um tipo de coleção onde pode-se iterar nos elementos. Em outras palavras, são coleções onde podemos navegar nos seus elementos.
Ambas as linguagens (Dart e TypeScript) tem implementações nativas para criação de coleções iteráveis. Em ambas, esse tipo é chamado de Iterable. Cada uma, obviamente, possui uma implementação diferente, mas ambas têm o mesmo objetivo e funções similares.
Os tipos mais comuns de coleções iteráveis são: Lists (ou Arrays), Maps e Sets. Nesse artigo, v…</span>

                    <span>Sometimes we have a long  list of imports, with files that come from the same place, it makes our code noisy and a bit longer, something like:
import { BeersService } from &#x27;./services/beers.service&#x27;;
import { WhiskyService } from &#x27;./services/whiski.service&#x27;;
import { WineService } from &#x27;./services/wine.service&#x27;;

We can simplify it by exposing all files, from a single file, to point to all of them.
Create index.ts, (you can name as you want, but most common is index) and export all services.
export * from &#x27;./beers.service&#x27;;
export * from &#x27;./whiski.service&#x27;;
export * from &#x27;./wine.service&#x27;;

Now we can update our files, to the new path.
import { BeersService, WhiskyService, WineService } from &#x27;./services/index&#x27;;

The code looks clean and easy to ready because all of them comes from the same place.

This article is a part of a series about how to create Generic CRUD Service &amp; Models in Angular:
Part 1 - Understanding Generics
Part 2 - What is CRUD?
Part 3 - Generic CRUD Model

  Generic CRUD Service


Before we start generating and writing code, let’s take a step back and see the bigger picture. The generic service should accept the following arguments:
the HttpClient is used for the HTTP requests
the class of model for creating instances
the path of the API endpoints.
Also, all resources should have 5 main methods related to CRUD…
Create - Returns a new resource.
Get all - Retrieves all resources as a list.
Get by ID - Returns a specific resource by ID.
Update - Updates a specific resource by…</span>

                    <span>If you are developing an application which has to display timestamp for posts/comments/notifications, you might come across this requirement where you have to format time in &quot;from now&quot; format. This is sometimes called timeago or relative time. 
You can either use a third party library like dayjs or momentjs for this, but for small projects, it is better to come up with your own utility function. In this tutorial we will write a util function which will accept a javascript Date object/ a string in ISO YYYY-MM-DD format/ or a date timestamp and convert it to relative time.
Eg:  2020-10-15 will be converted to &quot;an year ago&quot;

JavaScript Date objects represent a single moment in time in a platform-independent format.It is is fundamentally specified as the number of milliseconds that have elapse…</span>

Measure twice and cut once.

We wanted the absolute best developer experience for the users. So, we settled after a few trials on a process that worked well for us.
I set up working sessions between the component dev and myself.
Every component started with its own markdown file to document the design.
We put down the ideal developer usage and experience, for the component.
We referenced our existing version, component tickets history and industry leaders.
The states and interactions were then considered.
Once satisfied, we sought feedback from the rest of the dev team.
We also sought the feedback of some key dev community members.
The final design would then be honed, ready for coded implementation.

It looks like your application can&#x27;t read the environment variable properly.
I don&#x27;t know which package you are using to load environment variables but the simplest way is using dotenv package.
After installing it with npm i dotenv, import it as early as possible in your application main file like…

                    <span>In recent times, if you were a C# developer who wanted to build code for browsers, you had to resort to JavaScript, the most widely used programming language in the world. However, the web development industry is rapidly evolving, and developers no longer need to rely on JavaScript to create high-end online apps. Blazor is making it possible to run.NET in the browser without the need for add-ons or plugins, due to a technique called WebAssembly.
This blog will examine the current status of Blazor, its features, and its preparedness for production use, before comparing it to one of the most popular frameworks, Angular.
Here is why you should choose Angular for your next web development project.

As a new engineering manager, your first 90 days are crucial . You quickly realize the need to gain trust while rapidly building relationships and rapport — not only with your colleagues and your direct reports, but also with all the other discipline stakeholders. As an engineer, you spend 80% of your time with your engineering team, focusing on the engineering aspects of your role. But in a management position, you spend perhaps 50% of your time with your fellow engineers. The other 50% of your time is spent with people who are stakeholders representing cross-functional disciplines such as product, design + UX or the QA department if there is one.

Assume a demo namespace has two IRSA roles create with trust policy system:serviceaccount:demo:*
IAM Role 1 - ServiceAccount01 - access to S3 
Pod1 with ServiceAccount01 can access Role 2 just by exporting the AWS_ROLE_ARN &#x3D;  so that it will get access to S3 and DynamoDB .
EKS supports IRSA roles for the aws-node daemonset, it is security best practice to use IRSA role instead of system node role.

Modern applications base more and more on micro-services. Splitting large applications into smaller pieces makes the whole more maintainable and easier to develop. However, instead of developing a big monolith, we work on a bunch of tiny applications, making it more challenging to debug and deploy the whole system. Luckily, there are many tools out there to help us out. An interesting comparison of some of them can be found here. In what follows, we want to see how easy it is to do Kubernetes-based development with devspace.
Suppose we are developing a micro-services application, for example an e-shop. In essence, our e-shop consists of a frontend application that communicates with a backend through an API. For the sake of simplicity, let&#x27;s say …</span>

When a Scaleway Elements API Key is saved in Gitlab, we face all the security issues of storing credentials outside of the cloud infrastructure: Key rotation, age, destruction, location, etc.
There are 2 common reasons for developers to store GCP credentials in Gitlab CI:
They use shared runners.
They use specific/group runners deployed in a Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule cluster but do not use (or do not know about) Gitlab additional configurations.
The alternative that Gitlab CI proposes for users is to mount a secret volume to the runner pods that are created for each build.

                    <span>So, now that Docker Desktop is paid under certain scenarios, you may want to switch to something else.
This is a straight to the point guide on how to make Docker CE run fully on WSL2.
PS: the title says right way, but it is just my personal opinion. I am not claiming that any other guide does it in a wrong way.
A full-fledged Docker installation on WSL2
Docker Daemon automatic start without any crazy hacks
Docker Daemon sharing between Windows and WSL (i.e. you cannot run docker from Windows PowerShell)
Docker Daemon sharing between WSL distributions
I will consider that you already have WSL2 working, and you are using Ubuntu as your distribution.
Install Docker CE on Ubuntu by following the official guide:

All modern motherboards come equipped with an integrated RAID controller, and top models may have several such controllers on board. That’s a different question, though, if such integrated controllers in consumer-class motherboards are ever used by an average user. Anyway, some motherboards do give a chance to setup a RAID array right inside your home PC.
Below are brief recommendations on building a RAID array on a home computer and a practical tutorial on assembling a PC for RAID.

                    <span>A password manager is a computer program that allows users to store, generate, and manage their passwords for local applications and online services. A password manager assists in generating and retrieving complex passwords, storing such passwords in an encrypted database, or calculating them on demand. For the past seven years &quot;123456&quot; and &quot;password&quot; have been the two most commonly used passwords on the web. The problem is, most of us don&#x27;t know what makes a good password and aren&#x27;t able to remember hundreds of them anyway.

It looks like your application can&#x27;t read the environment variable properly.
I don&#x27;t know which package you are using to load environment variables but the simplest way is using dotenv package.
After installing it with npm i dotenv, import it as early as possible in your application main file like…

                    <span>Programming is just one big cycle. Create or download a project, install your dependencies, build something amazing, and move on to the next one. However, with node.js projects, there&#x27;s a glaring problem.
Every time you move on to another project, you leave incredible amounts of data in the node_modules folder that you may never use again. This can add up... quite quickly.

Don&#x27;t despair! There&#x27;s an easy fix, and it&#x27;s called npkill.

Clear space: Get rid of old and dusty node_modules cluttering up your machine.
Very fast: NPKILL is written in TypeScript, but searches are performed at a low level, improving performance greatly.
Easy to use: Say goodbye to lengthy commands. Using npkill is as simple as reading a list of your node_modules, and pressing Del to get rid of them. Could it be any easier? ;)
Minified: It barely has any dependencies.
You don&#x27;t really need to install it to use it…

It&#x27;s an easy CLI that provides a user friendly interface to scroll through all of your node_modules folders, and, if necessary, delete some at the click of the button.
Personally, I think it&#x27;s an incredibly cool and useful tool, and I&#x27;m sure you will too! To get started, just type:
npx npkill

And start freeing space!</span>

In addition, the final rule of the 21st Century Cures Act, effective June 30, 2020, implements provisions to “advance interoperability and support the access, exchange, and use of electronic health information”.

IAM Role 1 - ServiceAccount01 - access to S3 
Pod1 with ServiceAccount01 can access Role 2 just by exporting the AWS_ROLE_ARN &#x3D;  so that it will get access to S3 and DynamoDB .
EKS supports IRSA roles for the aws-node daemonset, it is security best practice to use IRSA role instead of system node role.

what would be a good way to categorize secrets?
Take a look at this:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID &#x3D; A3T6AKIAFJKR45SAWS5Z
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY &#x3D; hjshnk5ex5u34565d4654HJKGjhz545d89sjkjak

You can spot the difference: the first one is tied to a well identified service, AWS, while for the second, things are a bit blurrier: we immediately understand that it has to do with a database connection, but, without further context it doesn&#x27;t tell us what doors it opens.

When a Scaleway Elements API Key is saved in Gitlab, we face all the security issues of storing credentials outside of the cloud infrastructure: Key rotation, age, destruction, location, etc.
There are 2 common reasons for developers to store GCP credentials in Gitlab CI:
They use shared runners.
They use specific/group runners deployed in a Scaleway Kubernetes Kapsule cluster but do not use (or do not know about) Gitlab additional configurations.
The alternative that Gitlab CI proposes for users is to mount a secret volume to the runner pods that are created for each build.

                    <span>With the ever increasing adoption of moving workloads to public cloud providers like AWS, satisfying regulatory compliance has emerged as one of the most demanding requirements for businesses that operate on the cloud.
As an AWS customer, this means that you need to establish a proper governance model for your business operations to continue, particularly for those that operate under specific regulations. This &quot;model&quot;, is conceptualised under AWS Control Tower as a collection of guardrails. A guardrail is simply a rule that describes what is allowed or disallowed in your AWS account. Now, a guardrail can be of two forms, a preventive guardrail or a detective guardrail.
A preventive guardrail basically enforces a policy, such as using SCP to deny IAM users to specific APIs, so that those us…</span>

This time, I will try generating barcode images by JsBarcode.
JsBarcode - Barcode generator written in JavaScript
Node.js ver.16.11.0
TypeScript ver.4.4.4&quot;
canvas ver.2.8.0
dpi-tools ver.1.0.7
Express ver.4.17.1
jsBarcode ver.3.11.5
I can use jsBarcode in Node.js projects.
Node Setup - Install/JsBarcode Wiki - GitHub
import { Canvas } from &#x27;canvas&#x27;;
import JsBarcode from &#x27;jsbarcode&#x27;;

function generateBarcode(value: string): Buffer {
    const canvas &#x3D; new Canvas(100, 100, &quot;image&quot;);
    JsBarcode(canvas, value);
    return canvas.toBuffer();
}


I can add options.
For example, &quot;Code39&quot; can choose adding checksum(Modulus43) or not by &quot;mod43&quot;.
In TypeScript files, I can&#x27;t add &quot;mod43&quot; directly.

                    <span>I recently got the opportunity (and the privilege!) of starting a greenfield project at my current company, involving an frontend application for an internal tool. The devs involved had the chance to choose the tech stack that we considered convenient, and we collaboratively wrote an RFC (Request for Comment) and presented it to the rest of the company to open up our choices to discussion.
One of the main points that came up -after settling for React, the lingua franca framework at our company- is how we would handle state management. Our main application uses Redux, but many other alternatives were brought up: MobX, using native hooks (a combination of useReducer + useContext), using Redux plus Redux Toolkit. I even got to know and proposed Recoil, a super exciting project -and definitely…</span>

                    <span>In this post, I will show you how to set up Tailwind CSS with Reactjs(TypeScript).
What we will create is this.
https://hopeful-rosalind-29803f.netlify.app/
$ yarn create react-app react-tailwind-ts --template typescript

$ yarn add -D tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9

$ yarn add @craco/craco

In this step, we will edit two files, package.json and craco.config.js(create).

    postcss: {
      plugins: [require(&quot;tailwindcss&quot;), require(&quot;autoprefixer&quot;)],

  },
};

awk is a powerfull command line tool found included in all modern GNU/linux distributions. It is often excluded from beginner level Linux tutorials, where more fundamental commands like cd , pwd, ls etc are given more priority, and rightfully so. One must have a good grasp on the basic commmand line tools in order  to harness the full power of awk. 
awk in essence is a pattern scanning and processing language, emphasis on the language part because awk possesses functionality akin to most mainstream programming languages. 
awk loves tabulated data. So to begin with, you&#x27;ll need a piece of text represented as columns delimited by some common character. You see this pattern often in shells, for instance, the ls -l command that prints file information delimited by a space :

                    <span>There are often times when we are building websites that leverage the benefits of being delivered on a CDN (security, performance, no backend infrastructure required), and we want more powerful, dynamic functionality. The best way to increase functionality is through APIs; i.e. email contact forms, processing of outside data, or present information like the weather forecast, flight schedules, currency exchange rates etc. How would we make these API integrations quickly and securely if we do not want to build out a backend or add infrastructure to handle these API calls? Where do we secure the private API keys? What if we don&#x27;t want user authentication prior to allowing our users to interact with the 3rd party APIs? We will go over the best ways of executing these API integrations. Then we …</span>

                    <span>This new Malware family is up to no good:






A very clever malware designed with 3 components: - trojanized applications, - backdoors, and - rootkits. 🐞
It employs a rootkit to conceal its presence and uses different command and control servers for each sample, maintaining a low profile on your system as if nothing is happening will it cause havoc.
It is designed to launch and mediate access to a local SSH server, update itself, and transmit collected credentials. 🔒
FontOnLake is capable of file manipulation, updating itself, and uploading and downloading files
It accepts remote connections, serves as a proxy and can download and run Python scripts, in addition to exfiltrating credentials.
Surprisingly, this malware targets the one who is immune to most viruses, Linux
And the most scary part is that, it is still under development (and it is this deadly ☠️)
