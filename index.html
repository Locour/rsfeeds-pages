En esta publicación, veremos las nuevas funciones web que afectan la forma en que definimos el estilo en nuestras aplicaciones Angular.
En 2019,Sass introdujo un nuevo sistema de módulos, incluida una migración de @import a @use. Al cambiar a la sintaxis@use, podemos determinar más fácilmente qué CSS no se utiliza y reducir el tamaño de la salida CSS compilada. Esto hace que sea imposible extraer inadvertidamente dependencias transitivas. Cada módulo se incluye solo una vez, sin importar cuántas veces se carguen esos estilos.
Angular Material v12 incluyó una migración del uso de @import a @use para todas las importaciones en los estilos Angular Material Sass. Esta refactorización de nuestra Superficie de API de personaliza…</span>

FormData is an object that you can use for storing key-value pairs. It allows you to construct an object which aligns with an HTML form. This feature allows you to send the data, such as file upload using the XMLHttpRequest interface or Http client libraries.
You can use the following command to create the FormData:

Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 13 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
Auth0 is an easy to implement, adaptable authentication and authorization platform.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the account. Access the site https://auth0.com/ and click on the button Sign up.

2. Fill in the field Email and click on the button SIGN UP.

3. Fill in the fields Email, Password and click on the button Continue.

                    <span>Occasionally you might want to rename an AWS S3 bucket you are managing with Terraform. However, names of S3 buckets are immutable, which means you can’t change them directly. If you tried, Terraform would destroy the old one and then create a new one, resulting in data loss.
To avoid this, you need to create a new bucket with the desired name, move the data over to it, make the relevant Terraform state replacements, and finally delete the old bucket.
In this post you will learn how to rename an AWS S3 bucket in Terraform. First things first – let’s say you have a bucket definition in your Terraform code:
resource “aws_s3_bucket” “my_bucket” {
    bucket &#x3D; “old-name”
}

and you want to change the name of the bucket to new-name.

                    <span>Intro


When most engineers hear the term &#x27;full-stack&#x27; they think of an engineer who is able to not only design back-end APIs, manage databases, and architect complex server topologies; but also an engineer who can design elegant user interfaces, meaningful client interactions and build powerful tools driven by data. My definition is a little different in that I add an often overlooked layer - The Hardware ⚡ (along side the paired Firmware). It is a critical piece in making ANY &#x27;stack&#x27; function. Being an Embedded Software engineer who often toes the line between the Software and Hardware/Firmware world, I want to start a project where I architect, design, and build every piece of the &quot;stack&quot; and document it all along the way. A couple pieces will have some very clear goals and challenges, others are just to have fun and see what I come up with. It may seem like I am re-inventing the wheel on a couple things, but that&#x27;s the point. It&#x27;s a learning exercise!
The high-level plan is this: 
Create a custom PCB in KiCAD: Its purpose will be to remind you at a customized interval that you need to drink water 🌊(I desperately need to be reminded to hydrate).
Write firmware for the custom PCB with the ability to be updated via a custom USB bootloader and interact with the User via touch and gestures.
Write a cross-platform Desktop application using ElectronJS to update the the device via USB as well as pull and display your &quot;stats&quot; about your Drinking habits. Another function might be to upload the data to a backend database.
Write a web app to show your individual stats and a leaderboard to watch and compete against friends on.
Utilize Github CI/CD features for testing and releasing of all Firmware/Software pieces.
These pieces will each take a decent bit of time to architect, build, test and document so please bear with me as the cadence of these posts will be erratic at best. Happy Hacking!</span>

                    <span>An interesting new way to Build and Test in the Github environment before deploying is possible using Artifacts.

It involves breaking up 2 jobs in your workflow yml.

You will use the
actions/upload-artifact@v2
actions/download-artifact@v2

as a means to pass the artifact between the jobs.
- name: Archive production artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: dist-without-markdown
          path: |
            dist
            !dist/**/*.md

You also need to remember to name the artifact in case there are multiple artifacts produced in the workflow.
Finished workflow is below.

Apart from optimization and bugfixes, there are a few new features to discuss in the following parts.

With version 1.3.0 Compose Generator for Linux starts to support cli auto-completion. For Linux installations with the package manager (apt-get, yum, dnf) the auto-completion script is installed by default with the new version. The dockerized Compose Generator does not support auto-completion, for Windows auto-completion will be shipped with one of the next releases.

When talking about IAM, and referencing IAM policies, an AWS-Managed IAM policy can be referenced, but you can also create a customer-managed policy with AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy - this is in contrast to AWS::IAM::Policy, which is actually used to define an in-line policy. Before reading more about, I was thinking that ManagedPolicy referred to the AWS-managed ones, but that&#x27;s not the case.

                    <span>This post offers a brief introduction to GitOps and an overview of Argo CD, an open-source project implementing the GitOps approach. We had this opportunity at Promyze to experiment Argo CD, so we wanted to share with your our insights. 
GitOps is a concept promoted by WeaveWorks in 2017, with the core idea of describing the state of infrastructure in a Git repository. And Git is in the single source of truth.
Do you use Kubernetes and have dozens of YAML files? Maybe you even use Helm to deploy your app as a Chart? You now assume that all these configuration files are stored within a Git repository. 
Every time developers perform modifications in the source code of your applications, your existing continuous integration process is executed: unit tests, packaging, and finally, a new Docker…</span>

                    <span>Sticking to container security best practices is critical for successfully delivering verified software, as well as preventing severe security breaches and its consequences.
According to the 2020 CNFC Survey, 92 percent of companies are using containers in production, a 300 percent increase since 2016. Thus, Kubernetes, Openshift, and other container technologies are present everywhere.
But aren’t containers meant to be safe and isolated? Well, kind of.
For example, an exploitable vulnerability inside a container, combined with exposed metadata and a wrong credentials configuration, can compromise your whole cloud infrastructure. As described in our Cloud lateral movement post, a hacker can use this chain of exploits and wrong configurations to run crypto mining applications in your cloud …</span>

                    <span>Since I have started to operate Airbyte in production, I would like to introduce some points that I have devised for stable operation.
Airbyte is an OSS ETL system that provides a way to deploy with docker-compose or Kubernetes for various platforms. Airbyte Cloud is also available as a fully managed service. (https://airbyte.io/pricing ) However, it is currently provided only in the US, and it is planned to expand the service to countries other than the US in 2022. Since it is not possible to devote a lot of time to the construction and operation of system infrastructure in the environment where I am, using SaaS is a reasonable option if possible. But unfortunately, I&#x27;m a Japanese user, so I can&#x27;t use Airbyte Cloud at the moment.

                    <span>Création de variables d&#x27;environnement linux pour une utilisation dans les scripts bash ou dans les commandes du terminal.
On commence par créer une variable locale directement dans le terminal
DB_SAVES_PATH&#x3D;&#x27;/home/Griff/dbsvg&#x27;
On check que la variable est ok
echo $DB_SAVES_PATH
Le résultat s&#x27;affiche dans le terminal. Ici il doit être: /home/Griff/dbsvg
On passe la variable locale en variable d&#x27;environnement
export DB_SAVES_PATH
On check que la variable est bien enregistrée en tant que variable d&#x27;environnement
printenv DB_SAVES_PATH
Là encore le résultat affiché doit être: /home/Griff/dbsvg
Une fois les variables définies en variables d&#x27;environnement, elles sont accessibles directement dans les scripts bash ou ligne de commande.
Exemple dans un export de base de données :
mysqldump ma_base_de_données -u griff &gt; $DB_SAVES_PATH/export.sql
Lister toutes les variables d&#x27;environnement
env
Supprimer une variable d&#x27;environnement
unset DB_SAVES_PATH
export MA_VAR - Passage d&#x27;une variable locale en variable d&#x27;environnement


printenv MA_VAR - Affichage du contenu de ma variable dans le terminal


env MA_VAR - Listing de toutes les variables d&#x27;environnement


unset MA_VAR - Suppression d&#x27;une variable d&#x27;environnement

                    <span>This is my first article on dev.to, so go easy on me!
tmux is an open-source terminal multiplexer for Linux operating  distributions. It allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single window. 
on the other hand, ZSH, also called as &#x27;Z Shell&#x27;, is an extended version of the Bourne Shell (sh), with plenty of new features, and support for plugins and themes. Since it’s based on the same shell as Bash, ZSH has many of the same features, and switching over is a breeze.
If your editor for developing and coding is vim or sth like that, the best solution for you is tmux because you can always switch between tabs in a breeze and edit the code at the same time.
But if you are like me and use VSCode as code editor, I recommend you to install zsh and even OhMyZsh to have some great features like: auto suggestion(Not recommended), syntax highlighting and etc.
So, both of them are great and offer you some helpful features. zsh is more like a handful featured terminal and tmux will bring your editor and terminal at same place to switch simultaneously!</span>

A message broker is a computer program that allows software, systems, and services to communicate with each other and exchange data, taking incoming messages from applications and performing actions on them.
By using message brokers, producers and consumers can communicate with the broker using a standard protocol for communication, with the broker handling all the data&#x27;s state management and tracking.
This means all consumer applications do not need to take on the responsibility of managing state, tracking, and the message delivery complexity of the message broker itself. Message brokers rely on a component called message queues that store messages until a consumer service can process them.
In this article, we’ll compare two Node.js message brokers: Apache Kafka…</span>

                    <span>Sticking to container security best practices is critical for successfully delivering verified software, as well as preventing severe security breaches and its consequences.
According to the 2020 CNFC Survey, 92 percent of companies are using containers in production, a 300 percent increase since 2016. Thus, Kubernetes, Openshift, and other container technologies are present everywhere.
But aren’t containers meant to be safe and isolated? Well, kind of.
For example, an exploitable vulnerability inside a container, combined with exposed metadata and a wrong credentials configuration, can compromise your whole cloud infrastructure. As described in our Cloud lateral movement post, a hacker can use this chain of exploits and wrong configurations to run crypto mining applications in your cloud …</span>

                    <span>Introduction


One of the most important security concerns for entities using AWS is securing their AWS accounts. Evidently, managing an AWS account with 5 users may be somewhat a walk in the park. However, as the usage of the account scales, and the number of users increases, managing account becomes trivial. Several policies must be put in place in order to organize access between different stakeholders. 
One of the most common security features is to enable Multi-Factor Authentication on the AWS account users.
In this tutorial, we are going to setup a process that forbids any AWS user from using any service without:
Setting up an MFA device.
Signing in using MFA. Any user that signs in without MFA must not be allowed to manage any resource on AWS.
In this tutorial we will perform the fo…</span>

The whole software supply chain is a target for attackers and it is really important to make sure that we put all our effort into securing each link because if one fails, everything will be affected.
Supply chain activities include each step of the transformation of raw materials, components, and resources into a completed product, and its delivery to the end customer.
Each step could be a complex process itself and cause a security incident.
The software supply chain is similar to other activities or industries. Some resources are consumed, then transformed, through a series of steps and processes, and finally supplied as a product or service to a customer.

To port our web editor, DeckDeckGo, to DFINITY’s Internet Computer I developed several helpers in TypeScript to interact with our canister smart contracts.
If it can make your life easier too, here are those I use the most.
The Candid description that is generated for nullable types does not exactly match what I commonly used in JavaScript for optional types (see this post for the why and how).
For example, if we generate an interface for such a Motoko code snippet:
actor Example {
  public shared query func list(filter: ?Text) : async [Text] {
    let results: [Text] &#x3D; myFunction(filter);
    return results;
  };
}

The definition of the optional parameter filter will not be interpreted as a string that can potentially be undefined but, rather as a one-e…</span>

So understanding never can be quite baffling. If you&#x27;re like me and ever had faced similar issue then this blog should be able to explain it with the help of some examples.
Before taking you through the examples this is how TypeScript explains characteristics of never in their release notes.
never is a subtype of and assignable to every type.
No type is a subtype of or assignable to never (except never itself).
In a function expression or arrow function with no return type annotation, if the function has no return statements, or only return statements with expressions of type never, and if the end point of the function is not reachable (as determined by control flow analys…</span>

                    <span>Code reviews and pull requests are essential for many teams to increase code quality and transfer knowledge. However, it is often tedious for reviewers to comment on minor issues such as readability and style. 
P42+ automatically reviews the readability and style of your commits and pull requests and suggests improvements and modernization opportunities. This automation frees up reviewers&#x27; time to check for potential bugs and the overall correctness of the pull request.
Starting November 2021, P42+ for GitHub has several additional code review features:
P42+ now shows hints directly in your diffs, so you can easily see them when reviewing the code. 
Learn more...

The code review report that is part of the GitHub checks distinguishes between old and new suggestions for default branch commits, contains additional explanations, and lists annotations. Learn more...
You can configure each P42+ code action as either a hint (default) or blocker on the repository page. Hints leave messages on your pull requests, but do not fail the overall check. Learn more...

Code reviews for pull requests and default branch commits can now be enabled with a single click for existing repositories. Code reviews for new repositories are enabled by default.

                    <span>A few days ago I asked Twitter how would one solve the task of implementing a button component that can also display an icon. Is it by adding an icon property to the button component or by having a separate icon component nested inside the button? I also asked why would one choose one approach over the other.

Quite a few people replied with their pros and cons for both options. In this post I’m going to try and summarize the points mentioned there. I think that’s quite valuable to have as a reference in the future.

                    <span>Let&#x27;s take an analytical look at several of the key library / frameworks and compare them to Vanilla JavaScript.
Basically, I want to explore these tools in various ways:
Installation Processes
Setup Processes
Code Management
Routing
Binding Props
Binding Events
Services (API Access, etc.)
Referencing Assets
Unit Testing
Code Execution (Build Process and Size)
To do this, four separate builds of the same project were implemented. There were three &quot;frameworks&quot;:
Angular
React
Vue
And, the fourth build was Vanilla JS.
The core logic was complex enough to use several parts of the frameworks, but simple enough I could build this in a reasonable time frame.

Moreover, here’s the complete step-by-step guide to hire AngularJS developers who would prove to be the perfect fit for your project.
Prepare the project description:
The first and foremost step is preparing the project description. Without a clear description, it’s difficult to find the right talents.  Also, make sure you have not missed any important details about your project. If you already have an existing developer team, you can get their assistance in this. This helps you determine what developer expertise you need. Besides, this will also assist the candidate to know whether they possess the necessary expertise to participate in your project.

Limitar o acesso aos metadados de uma instância faz parte de uma estratégia de segurança em camadas, que tem como objetivo impedir o acesso aos metadados por usuários/aplicações não autorizadas. 
Essa ação soma-se à utilização do IMDSv2.
Podemos utilizar regras de iptables para limitar o acesso, permitindo acesso a usuários ou grupos específicos.
O exemplo a seguir libera o acesso ao serviço de metadados da instância por todos os processos em execução na conta do usuário &quot;app&quot;.
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 --proto tcp --destination 169.254.169.254 --match owner --uid-owner app--jump ACCEPT

O exemplo a seguir impede o acesso ao serviço de metadados da instância por todos os processos, exceto os processos em execução na conta do usuário root.
sudo iptables --append OUTPUT --proto tcp --destination 169.254.169.254 --match owner ! --uid-owner root --jump REJECT

A ordem é fundamental, a regra de bloqueio deverá ser a última.
Obs.: O módulo owner do iptables só corresponderá à associação do grupo se o grupo for o grupo primário de um determinado usuário local. Outros grupos não são correspondidos.

                    <span>SSH config ช่วยให้เรา config option ของแต่ละ host เอาไว้หลายๆอันได้ ทำให้ตอนเรียก ssh ใส่แค่ชื่อ hostname ใน config ก็พอแล้ว
เวลาใช้ ssh เพื่อ remote เครื่องอื่น ปกติแล้วจะสั่งประมาณนี้
ssh user@hostname

หรือถ้ามี port ที่ต่างจาก ssh ปกติ (22) ก็ใส่ option สำหรับ port เพิ่มคือ
ssh -p 2222 user@hostname

หรือถ้ามี IdentityFile ด้วย ก็ต้องเพิ่ม option ไปอีกแบบนี้
ssh -i identity.key -p 2222 user@hostname

ตัวอย่างเช่นผมจะ ssh เข้า Ubuntu ที่ลงไว้ใน Virtual Box โดยใช้ vagrant ปกติแล้วจะสั่ง vagrant ssh ก็ได้ แต่ถ้าจะสั่งด้วย ssh เองโดยตรงจะต้องสั่งประมาณนี้
ssh -i ~/vagrants/ubuntu/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key -p 2222 vagrant@127.0.0.1

ทีนี้ถ้าเราจะใช้ SSH config ช่วยเราก็สร้างไฟล์ config ที่ $HOME/.ssh/config
จากนั้นกำหนดค่าแบบนี้
Host ubuntu-vagrant
  HostName 127.0.0.1
  IdentityFile ~/vagrants/ubuntu/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
  Port 2222
  User vagrant

ลักษณะ config file ของ SSH ก็มี key เช่น Host, HostName, IdentityFile, Port และ User แล้วเว้นวรรคด้วย 1 ช่องว่าง ตามด้วยค่าที่กำหนดให้ key นั้นๆ 
แล้วก็มีการใช้ indentation เพื่อบอกว่าค่านั้นเป็น key/value ย่อยๆของ key หลักอีกที
จากตัวอย่างผมกำหนด Host คือ ubuntu-vagrant แล้วก็กำหนดค่า HostName เป็น IP หรือ Domain name ของ Host ที่เราต้องการต่อ แล้วก็ค่า IdentityFile ไปที่ path ของ private key ของ vagrant ที่กำหนดให้กับ VM ที่ต้องการ remote ตามด้วยค่า Port 2222 แล้วก็​ User คือ username ในทีนี้คือ vagrant
เสร็จแล้วหลังจากนั้นเวลาเราต้องการ connect ไปที่ Ubuntu ใน VM ก็แค่สั่ง
ssh ubuntu-vagrant

เท่านี้ก็ได้แล้ว</span>

To start off, a reference to a starwars quote: &#x27;This is not the free memory you&#x27;re looking for&#x27;. 
What this quote means to say is that whilst the free memory statistic obviously shows free memory, what you are actually looking for is the amount of memory that can be used for memory allocations on the system. On linux, this is not the same as free memory.
Of course free memory is directly available, actually free memory, which can be directly used by a process that needs free memory (a free page). A free page is produced by the kernel page daemon (commonly named &#x27;swapper&#x27;),…</span>

I find it quite hard to find the right steps when you already have a set of technologies in your project, and as the title goes, my target audience are those who already know how to develop a backend application in Express + MongoDB but not how to write tests for it. If you are still with me, let&#x27;s get started. 
Node.js
JavaScript runtime environment outside of browser
Express
Backend application framework for Node.js
MongoDB
NoSQL database like JSON.
Jest
JavsScript testing framework maintained by Facebook
supertest
npm package that helps test HTTP
Prepare a mongodb in memory server for testing
Write tests with jest and supertest
(Optional) Set up NODE_ENV to test

                    <span>Providing captions for audio and video isn&#x27;t just a nice-to-have - it&#x27;s critical for accessibility. While this isn&#x27;t specifically an accessibility post, I wanted to start by sharing Microsoft&#x27;s Inclusive Toolkit. Something I hadn&#x27;t considered before reading this was the impact of situational limitations. To learn more, jump to Section 3 of the toolkit - &quot;Solve for one, extend to many&quot;. Having a young (read &quot;loud&quot;) child, I&#x27;ve become even more aware of where captions are available, and if they aren&#x27;t, I simply can&#x27;t watch something with her around.
There are two common and similar caption formats we are going to generate today - WebVTT and SRT. A WebVTT file looks like this:

                    <span>This repo is designed to convert any data, number and text into barcode. The barcode you produce is valid everywhere and when you read it with a barcode reader, it shows the data you entered. It is a very practical and fast way to encrypt or organize products.
Any data you convert to barcode will be valid everywhere. You can scan and save them with the barcode reader and organize the products in a shop.
In addition, you can use your passwords or data that you do not want anyone to see by converting them to barcodes.
It is not risky to make this conversion on the website. Because it is completely coded with vanilla JS. Since there is no database or registration network, you can use it with peace of mind. 
Also, your comments and interest are very important to me. I look forward to your feedback.
Take care and don&#x27;t forget to fork :)

When it comes to Cloud technology we can use resources that store our sensitive information in a secure environment. For example, Azure Key Vault allows us to store secrets, certificates and keys where we can set access control using authentication methods like Azure AD.
But when we add secrets into a secure resource like Key Vault, how do we access them when running deployments?
In this blog post I will be covering how we get the secrets from an Azure Key Vault for a deployment in GitHub Actions.
We will need login to Azure using the Azure CLI. The first workflow step will be the following:

                    <span>AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that allows you to concentrate on the cryptographic needs of your applications while Amazon Web Services (AWS) manages availability, physical security, logical access control, and maintenance of the underlying infrastructure. 
Further, AWS KMS allows you to audit usage of your keys by providing logs of all API calls made on them to help you meet compliance and regulatory requirements.
Customers want to know how to effectively implement AWS KMS in their environment. 
This whitepaper discusses how to use AWS KMS for each capability described in the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework Security Perspective whitepaper, including the differences between the different types of customer master keys, using AWS KMS key policies to ensure least privi…</span>

In this tutorial, I will generate a TypeScript client code based on the Swagger documentation and use it on a simple React application (it can be any front-end application).
Why we want to do something like this? First of all, it&#x27;s better to have one a single source of truth for the contracts in our server-client architecture. Otherwise, one change can break all our consumers.
For this process, I&#x27;m gonna use swagger-typescript-api. I&#x27;ve seen this tool constantly evolving throughout the last year, its maintainers are doing an awesome job.

                    <span>É possível converter os dados de um formulário HTML para JSON de forma muito prática.
Primeiro selecionamos nosso elemento form
Então criamos uma instância de FormData usando nosso form
Então podemos usando Object.fromEntries usando o método entries da instância FormData




const form &#x3D; document.querySelector(&#x27;form&#x27;)
const data &#x3D; new FormData(form)
const values &#x3D; Object.fromEntries(data.entries())
console.log(values)

Desta forma temos todos elementos do formulário mapeados num objeto JSON, como esperado.

Precisa fazer as seguintes etapas:
Criar o diretório com o nome do seu projeto
Criar o package.json
Criar o tsconfig.json
Instalar as dependências


esbuild
esbuild-serve
typescript
prettier
Criar o diretório src
Escrever o TypeScript inicial dentro de src

Criar o diretório public/styles
Escrever o HTML inicial dentro de public

Escrever o CSS inicial dentro de public/styles

Criar a configuração do ESBuild
Criar a configuração do prettier
Adicionar &quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot; ao package.json

Adicionar o script de build ao package.json

Adicionar o script de start ao package.json

Executar o npm start



Ou então compactar tudo isso em um script bash e usa-lo da seguinte forma
./create-project.sh meu-projeto

Segue o código do script
Ele é extremamente simples e resolve o propósito com excelência.
Espero ter ajudado, até a próxima.

                    <span>I struggled with this concept a lot, but let me save you the stress, and explain as simply as I can.
Typescript is just a secure way of writing JavaScript code. Do not get confused by the fancy terminologies people throw around it.
The good news is, if you know JavaScript, you already know ~90% of Typescript. The additional layer only forces you to be a lot more intentional about your variables and data types.
...
Simple answer? To catch errors early in your editor. 
...
let id &#x3D; 1
let company &#x3D; &quot;GYRO Design Lab&quot;
let isPublished &#x3D; true
let mandem &#x3D; [&quot;Dexter&quot;, &quot;Mide&quot;, &quot;Emmy&quot;]


But the unfortunate thing here is that, at some point later in your code, the variable company - for instance, could be re-assigned to a value of an entirely different data type, which would be unexpected behavior.

                    <span>Pipeline operators are an upcoming feature to Javascript which gives us another way to pass values through a series of transformations. It gives more context to what developers were trying to achieve when they wrote their code, and allow us to do some cool things to boot. Here, we&#x27;ll take a quick look at pipeline operators, how they work, and how you can use them today.
Currently, no browser or server side ECMAScript implementation (like Node.JS) support pipeline operators. You can, however, get them to work using Babel 7.15. You can learn more about installing Babel here, but suffice to say this will allow you to add pipeline operators into your code.

Hello, DEV World! 👋
This weekend I had time to refactor my old projects, where I found an interesting case of working with JWT in a Vue.js web application, which I&#x27;ll tell you about now.
🔥 Disclaimer: The article is intended primarily for advanced frontend developers, because it does not contain a beginner&#x27;s description of technologies in use. You should already understand how the Vue 3.x framework and Vuex 4.x works, and the basics of JWT.
OK, let&#x27;s go! 😉

The structure of the business logic

Function for calling the background update tokens

                    <span>Masonry views on a website are visually appealing. Let&#x27;s quickly create a carousel with you using TailwindCSS. This article assumes basic knowledge of Tailwind.
First of all, let&#x27;s add @layer to your index.css file in src folder. We create masonry layout class for 3 different screen;
.masonry         (1 column)
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer utilities {
    @variants responsive {
        .masonry {
            column-gap: 1.5em;
            column-count: 1;
        }
        .masonry-sm {
            column-gap: 1.5em;
            column-count: 2;
        }
        .masonry-md {
            column-gap: 1.5em;
            column-count: 3;
        }
        .break-inside {
            break-inside: avoid;
        }

    }
}

Now you can use these classes as standard TailwindCSS feature. You should use them inside parent div.

That is all. You now have a masonry layout that is simple to use and looks good.</span>

Let&#x27;s get it done in the simplest way!! 
We&#x27;ll be using Webpack with TypeScript. Let&#x27;s start!
Create a folder and open it in your favorite editor (mine VS Code). Then type this command on your project terminal
npm init -y

                    <span>Description


There is an excellent feature called Marble tests from RxJS to test asynchronous code synchronously. We could easily use it in Angular unit tests. I have made a few basic examples about testing code by Marble tests in Angular.
My project is using Angular, so I have created a new project (using Angular CLI) by typing in console:
ng new marble-tests

My demo project is quite simple, so I answered no on
I have made a simple dummy service for getting data. All of its methods return observables using of operator, which returns the stream from given arguments. The complete code is below.
import { Injectable } from &#x27;@angular/core&#x27;;
import { Observable, of } from &#x27;rxjs&#x27;;

@Injectable({

                    <span>Introdução


Provavelmente você já deve ter ouvido sobre &quot;processos&quot; enquanto estava mexendo em seu computador. A maioria de nós talvez só nos damos conta da existência deles em &quot;momentos ruins&quot;, por exemplo, quando alguma aplicação está travada e temos que &quot;finalizar o processo dela&quot;. Contudo, fora o conhecimento em saber como finalizar o &quot;bendito&quot; para você continuar exercendo suas atividades, algo importantíssimo também é entender qual é a real importância de um processo.
Quando estamos trabalhando em um ambiente multiprogramado/multitarefa, o Sistema Operacional (SO) é responsável por gerenciar diversos programas executados &quot;concorrentemente&quot;, controlando o compartilhamento dos recursos para cada um deles. Para que isso seja possível, todo programa executado deve sempre estar associado…</span>

                    <span>It’s not that unusual to need to see/check/verify the binary output of a shell command in HEX format. Clearly, I mean without picking up a HEX editor or something like that. Last time, it happened to me a few days ago when I was to inspect the content of a base64-encoded string. The tool to the rescue is (of course not limited to) xxd. 🏅
Using xxd, to get the HEX representation for some binary content you just need to call it with no argument:
echo -n &#x27;Computer says: &quot;Hello World!&quot;&#x27; | xxd

Depending on the case it could be more insightful to also have the ASCII values column. That’s simply done by calling xxd with -C option:
echo -n &#x27;Computer says: &quot;Hello World!&quot;&#x27; | xxd -C

Which results in such a neat output:
00000000: 436f 6d70 7574 6572 2073 6179 733a 2022 Computer says: &quot;
00000010: 4865 6c6c 6f20 576f 726c 6421 22 Hello World!&quot;

Also, xxd can do things the other way. For instance, may you need to turn a HEX string into a binary content, just call xxd with -r option, like this:
echo -n &quot;0x48656c6c6f20576f726c6421&quot; | xxd -r

Which would result in:
Hello World!

There are more xxd options which you can find by checking:
xxd --help

or
man xxd

About Regular Encounters

Before we start, it is assumed that you are:
Familiar with basic Linux commands and operation
Aware of what Hadoop is and how it works




  
  
  Initial setup


Set up a virtual machine (VM) or cloud instance (or physical machine, if you wish) with a fresh installation of Ubuntu 20.04. Ensure that the VM or cloud instance is reachable from the host (with ping or otherwise), and that the appropriate ports are open if a firewall is enabled. For the purposes of this tutorial, you may wish to disable the firewall (the default in Ubuntu 20.04) and / or enable all inbound traffic for the security group (or equivalent) associated with the cloud instance if you are using one, though note that you …</span>

                    <span>When you use Ubuntu server or other Linux server, you need configures IP Address using CLI interactive. Now i can show you how to configures IP Address in Ubuntu and Debian. Let&#x27;s start
Ubuntu
first, you should know where is the interface when you assign an IP. Type this command on your terminal:
$ ifconfig   
or
$ ip address

after that, so we can assign an IP to interface &#x27;ens33&#x27; by type this command:
$ sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml

then type this:
network:
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      addresses: [172.16.238.20/24]
      gateway4: 172.16.238.2
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8]
  version: 2


after all, you must apply or enable the configure:
$ sudo netplan apply
$ ifconfig

2: ens33:  mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:0c:29:77:41:f0 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.16.238.20/24 brd 172.16.238.255 scope global ens33
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::20c:29ff:fe77:41f0/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

Debian
Okay, after that i think you should configure too in Debian side. First thing, type this command on your Debian terminal:
$ nano /etc/network/interfaces

after that, add this command to assign an IP:
auto ens33
iface ens33 inet static
address 172.16.238.10/24
gateway 172.16.238.2
nameservers 8.8.8.8

finally, save it by type ctrl+s to save then ctrl+x to exit. Let&#x27;s apply:
$ /ete/init.d/networking restart

[ ok ] Restarting networking (via systemctl): networking.service.

then check your IP configure:
$ ip address

2: ens33:  mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:0c:29:a0:41:4e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.16.238.10/24 brd 172.16.238.255 scope global ens33
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::20c:29ff:fea0:414e/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever</span>

                    <span>Do it
But how does Angular know how to deal with this (click) thing? 
It works because of the so called Event Biding. Basically it binds the target event name (click) to a method from the component (doSomething).
As explained in this nice article , Angular doesn&#x27;t have a list of it&#x27;s own event names, but it actually uses the names of the underlying DOM events.
So the event binding part of the Do it snippet is the equivalent of this vanilla snippet:
element.addEventListener(&#x27;click&#x27;, () &#x3D;&gt; { doSomething() });


This means the if I want to know which events I can bind to in Angular I can search them here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
What about the $event?
If the event is a DOM event, like click, mouseenter, keyup etc then the $event is the event itself. For example in the case of click, the $event is a MouseEvent.
EventEmitter) the $event is actually the emitted data.</span>
