Three months ago we stopped using ENV files as the default export option in the Doppler CLI. This change led to a number of benefits including supporting multi-line variables and a deterministic schema. Before going too deep on the technical choices we made, let&#x27;s first go over what ENV files are and how they&#x27;re used.
What are ENV files?


ENV files are plain text files that store variables and secrets that you would not want hardcoded in your codebase. These variables could be a port number or a database url, and may change depending on where your code is deployed. For example, when developing locally you may use port 3000, but when deployed to Heroku your application will need to use the port it&#x27;s dynamically a…</span>

                    <span>Today I&#x27;m going to show you how you can easily export Issue, Releases, Milestone, Commit History and more from GitHub, using the GitHub Artifact Exporter.
GitHub Artifact Exporter provides a CLI and a simple GUI for exporting GitHub Issues and related comments based on a date range, and it supports GitHub’s full search syntax, allowing you to filter results based on your search parameters.

The CLI also supports exporting:
Commits
Milestones,
Projects
Pull requests, including comments
Releases

And you can export all of that in different formats: JSON, JSON lines, CSV, and Jira-formatted CSV. And of course if you export in CSV, it means that you can open it in Excel. Cool right?

บางทีเปลี่ยน font แล้วลง พวก Noto เรียนร้อยแล้วก็ยังไม่ได้อย่างใจ บางทีเป็นเพราะว่าระบบจะเลือก font ให้เราเอง ซึ่งไปแก้ได้ในไฟล์
ผมชึ้นหัวว่า MX Linux แต่จริง ๆ จะใช้ Void Linux, Ubuntu กระทั่งพวก NetBSD ก็น่าจะเหมือนกันหมด

ซึ่งอันนี้ผมแก้ตาม https://jichu4n.com/posts/how-to-set-default-fonts-and-font-aliases-on-linux/ และ https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Font_configuration/Examples

                    <span>Learning a new Node.js framework can be daunting given the speed at which the ecosystem moves these days. Also some of the information on learning new techniques with Node.js is outdated - for example the sheer number of Express tutorials you still find out there! Express is long overdue for a replacement, and Fastify fits right in!  One of the first things to consider when running a Node.js server is how to handle logging the right way. ExpressJS did not offer anything out of the box, forcing another bike shed to paint amongst your team.  Fastify on the other hand recognizes that this is a critical piece of running a server and provides sensible defaults - in the case of logging - the pino logger.

Nesse modelo a renderização fica a cargo do servidor, o que torna o carregamento da aplicação mais eficiente. Além de possibilitar melhor performance, nesse modelo também podemos lidar com alguns problemas de SEO (como indexação).
Indexação: é possível definir o conteúdo que será carregado a partir do servidor, sendo assim, este conteúdo seria indexado nos motores de busca. 
Aparelho do usuário: como a renderização acontece do lado do servidor, ocorre uma menor exigência do dispositivo do usuário. 
Performance: Na maioria dos casos tem boa performance e bons resultados na experiência por parte do usuário.
Time to first byte maior, já que o servidor irá preparar o conteúdo a ser carregado.

                    <span>Hi guys! I am going to explain you to how to setup your local environment and workspace for create your first Angular application locally using Angular CLI tool. Simply following my steps finally, you can create Angular applications and configure application yourself. I am using my Windows pc to show you to understand the commands I used to create Angular application.
Step 01


Before create application there are some prerequisites.
1. You should be familiar with following.
JavaScript
HTML
CSS
TypeScript (Not required)
2. To install Angular on your local system, you must install following.
Node.js (Version: Current, Active LTS or Maintenance LTS) 
You can  download and install Node.js follow this  link. If you already installed Node.js you can run this command on terminal window.
node -v

                  <div class="article-summary-box-inner">
                    <span class="article-reading-time">(3 min)</span>
                    <span>In this article I will show you how to dockerize an angular application using nginx server. If you would like more information about the nginx server  you can find it here: https://www.nginx.com/
To get started we create a dockerfile with two stages:
Stage 1
Copy the angular code from a local machine to a docker machine.
Copy the packages.json to install dependencies.
Install the angular-cli and npm dependencies.
Build an angular application.
For this stage we use a node machine image from the dockerhub https://hub.docker.com/_/node
Stage 2
Copy the angular dist folder from the previous docker machine named build on to the nginx location folder.
Then we use the default cmd that starts the nginx server. 
For this stage we will use a node machine from the dockerhub https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx
FROM node:12.7-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY / ./
COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install -g @angular/cli@10.0.4 &amp;&amp; \
    npm install &amp;&amp; \
    ng build
COPY . .

FROM nginx:1.17.1-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from&#x3D;build /app/dist/ui /usr/share/nginx/html

Once that is done, we will create the Dockerfile, and build the image to run it.
&gt; docker build -t  -f Dockerfile .

Now we can verify if the image is created by running the following command.
&gt; docker images

Now that we have created the image in order to run it we have two options:. 
docker-compose.yml file like this:
version: &#x27;3&#x27;
services:
    server:
        image: 
        ports:
            - &quot;80:80&quot;
        tty: true
        expose:
            - &quot;80&quot; 
        stdin_open: true
        environment:
            - MODE&#x3D;dev
        command: 

If we want to run a command when we run the image we can specify on command.
docker run -d -p 80:80  command

Hope you liked and also helps you in case you have to dockerize an angular app.</span>

If you&#x27;re just looking for the bird-eye view, then check out the official release announcement. Here, I&#x27;ll dig much deeper into the release notes.
The Angular team has been working on Ivy (the new compilation &amp; rendering pipeline) since 2018. It was finally released with Angular 8. Since Angular 9, Ivy has been the default for new projects, and the ecosystem is slowly migrating to it. With Angular 12, the old View Engine is now officially deprecated. It will be removed in a future major release. Also, it won&#x27;t be possible to create new applications using View Engine. Finally, Ivy…</span>

                    <span>Overall idea behind this article to explain and demonstrate the usage of ControlValueAccessor and Validator interfaces . The former is used to bind together a FormControl from Forms package and native DOM elements. The latter is used to implement validation logic. They can exist independently of each other, but in this article we’ll implement both using a single directive. Our directive will add the following functionality to the application:
Conversion between input value and control value
Validation for invalid date
If you’re using ControlValueAccessor for the first time, I would recommend going through this article first: Never again be confused when implementing ControlValueAccessor in Angular forms. 
We will first create a directive and handle conversion between UI and control value.

                    <span>Step 1 - Install dependency
npm i ng-recaptcha --save

Step -2 Open app.module.ts and add below import-
import { RecaptchaModule } from &#x27;ng-recaptcha&#x27;;

Also add this to imports -
imports: [RecaptchaModule,],

Step 3 - Open that component where you want to add human verification reCAPTCHA and then add below code -

yourcomponentname.component.html
 

yourcomponentname.component.ts
public resolved(captchaResponse: string) { 
console.log(&#x60;Resolved captcha with response: ${captchaResponse}&#x60;); // Write your logic here about once human verified what action you want to perform 
}

Step 5 - This siteKey will work on localhost, you must have to generate your own siteKey, for this please visit google.com/recaptcha and add your domain and generate key, it&#x27;s very simple and then replace the new key to markup of step3.  
All done.</span>

                    <span>Quando estamos trabalhando em alguma empresa ou projeto, é uma prática comum entrarmos rapidamente no espírito de equipe, que normalmente acontece devido à aplicação de metodologias ágeis, ou, em um estágio mais avançado, com uma cultura devops mais encorpada.
Mas, naqueles projetos pessoais, muitas vezes a máxima &quot;em casa de ferreiro, espeto de pau&quot;, também é uma realidade. As razões podem ser várias, mas geralmente há aquela noção de que os demais projetos e atividades têm prioridade no uso do tempo.
O resultado, muitas vezes, é desorganização que pode custar perda de tempo, dados e, com isso, dinheiro.
Então, nessa ideia de &quot;arrumar a casa&quot;, vou mostrar como implementei o CI/CD de um de meus projetos, o Gunbot Brasil. A pipeline é simples, e o conceito é aplicável para qualquer site est…</span>

Kubernetes is feature filled with all the good-ness one of which is scaling, it’s often &amp; assumption that Kubernetes comes with AutoScaling **as default, but that’s hardly the case, we often need to tweak the bars to make things actually work.

You&#x27;ve heard a lot about Docker and completed a few online tutorials to containerise your app. All set, right? But what do you need to know if you&#x27;re going to move that app to a production environment on the public Internet? What if you&#x27;re using it for your job and need to pass security scans and DevOps checks?
In this series, I introduce some basic concepts for making production ready containers. I also introduce the concept of &quot;slimming&quot; a container.

In a previous article, Introduction to Message Queues, we took a look at the fundamentals of message queues. The article introduced message queues, message producers and consumers, and the advantages to using message queues for asynchronous processing in our system architecture.
In this post, we will go further into the internals of message queues, and look at different strategies used to handle interaction between producers and consumers. We will also expand more on producers and consumers, and what application developers need to keep in mind when designing them to work with message queues.
A message queue does not work in isolation — it is mainly a broker of messages between message producers and message consumers. Each distinct entity in the setup has a responsibility and…</span>

                    <span>I can hear your mind wheels spinning -
What’s this blasphemy? Isn’t SaaS the end of all evils - why are you asking me to think about keeping data in your infrastructure?
Well, well - allow me to explain. SaaS is the greatest thing after sliced bread, if you are a small startup. You don’t care about where your data is, privacy and security is not something which you are concerned about right now. You just want to move fast and break things!
But not all companies are born equal, and not all industries are the same in terms of the sensitivity of data they handle. And as you mature as a company, you need to be more careful of how you handle your critical data.
For example, if you are a fast growing fin-tech company working with a number of banking APIs and enabling hundreds of financial transa…</span>

While cloud delivers on its promise early on, once your company scales and its growth slows down, cloud costs start putting pressure on margins and contribute A LOT to COR or COGS.

                    <span>While logging or registering the user , we generally return the user data , password or hashed password is also returned along with the data , we do not want to send the hashed password to frontend so how do we exclude.
After creating user
const createdUser &#x3D; await User.create({
  email: email,
  password: await argon2.hash(password),
});
if (createdUser) {
  const { password, ...responseUser } &#x3D; createdUser._doc;
  return { user: responseUser };
}

the ._doc contains the data like email , username , password which we specify in the schema
let user &#x3D; await User.findOne({ email: email });
if (user) {
  if (await argon2.verify(user.password, password)) {
    const { password, ...responseUser } &#x3D; user._doc;
    return { user: responseUser };
  } else {
    return {
      error: [{ field: &quot;password&quot;, message: &quot;wrong password&quot; }],
    };
  }
}

We do the same thing but after finding the user

                    <span>When I quit the last company I was working at to pursue my own business adventures, building and selling a starter template or software library was high on my list of things I wanted to do.
In this guide, I would like to show you how quickly you can start selling your own npm packages or other code.
It is very easy to start selling an npm package using basetools. However, there are some prerequisites to start selling: You have to have a private Github repository inside an organization and you have to publish your package using the Github registry. But we will cover all of this within this guide.
For this guide, we will create a brand new repository on Github and start from there. If you have already created a repository, you can just skip this step.

                    <span>Developers have now started leveraging microservices architecture because several small services ensure that complex and large applications function cohesively. Several tech giants have moved to microservices, like Netflix, Amazon, Twitter, Spotify, etc. 
Now if you also want to develop microservices architecture, a common question will pop up in your mind regarding which language would be the best for your project. Before jumping on to the best technologies to build microservice architecture, let us know what it is. 
The microservices architecture refers to a development procedure where a single application can be fragmented into a series of several more minor services. The services then execute in their process and also interact with lightweight mechanisms. Microservices are established …</span>

                    <span>Since May 2021 has come to an end, as usual, we’re ready to share our news and updates with the developer community. The past month brought you a new GetBlock product, several partnerships, a discount offer for dedicated nodes, new docs and developer guides, and way more!
Raw blockchain data for dedicated nodes is now live on GetBlock in Beta mode!
Normally, when you retrieve blockchain data from a node, you receive a response in readable insights on a block height or transaction. Raw data is a non-processed encrypted code that can be used by developers for performing advanced analytics, conducting data analysis or building a node client.

Currently, information in a raw format can be provided for Bitcoin (including its derivatives, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Litecoin, Bitcoin Gold, etc.), …</span>

                    <span>This is a concept that really drives home how nice it is when your entire stack is written in the same language. I am using node/typescript on the backend which means I can share stuff between the ui and api.
I have a separate repo that holds common stuff like error codes, request payloads and response payloads:
// Contracts
export interface SearchProductsRequest {
  page: number;
  q: string;
}

export interface SearchProductsResponse {
  nextPage: number;
  products: Product[];
}

Then I can use that to bridge the gap between api and ui:
// API
async function searchProductsApi(
  req: Request,
  res: Response
) {
  // req.query is strongly typed
  const result &#x3D; await search(req.query);

  // res.send will throw a ts error if result doesn&#x27;t match the response
  res.status(200).send(result);
}

// UI
// (driver is a simple wrapper around the fetch api)
async function searchProducts(args) {
  // data will be strongly typed
  const { data } &#x3D; await driver({
    url: &quot;/products&quot;,
    // will throw a ts error is args doesn&#x27;t match the request
    data: args,
  });
}

Now both sides of my application can have confidence that they will be receiving/sending the same payloads!</span>

                    <span>Azure Transparent Data Encryption or TDE is a technique of encrypting data at rest, mainly database files, at the file level. This solves the problem of protecting the data at rest. This performs real-time encryption and decryption of the data, their associated backups, and the log files without any change in the application codebase. This concept is applicable for SQL Database, SQL Managed Instance and Azure Synapse Analytics.
TDE is called transparent because the authorized users of the database do not need to create any macros or any special configuration to be able to access the data.
TDE performs the encryption and decryption of data at the page level whereby each page is decrypted as its read into the memory and is encrypted again as its being written in to the disk. The encryption h…</span>

If your company isn&#x27;t employing CIAM, you risk slipping behind competitors who are using the technology and collecting customer data.
For a safe and seamless customer experience, CIAM delivers the ease of a centralized customer database that integrates all other apps and services. 
A CIAM solution will often include customer registration, self-service account management, consent and preferences management, single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), access management, directory services, and data access governance.

Many organizations are also vulnerable to spear-phishing, whale phishing, ransomware, and other malware attacks. As a result, large and small businesses must devise strategies to protect against emerging email security threats. More than 91% of cyber attacks are now launched via email, and email remains the weakest point in the security chain. 
Due to the rising demand for online communication, email remains a top security issue or even a weakness in 2021. When it comes to email protection, traditional measures such as the most up-to-date antivirus software will never be able to prevent cyber-attacks, especially advanced social engineering attacks.

If you&#x27;re using Git and GitHub then there are a few ways to authenticate to ensure your code is secure.
If you work in tech, you&#x27;ve probably heard the term SSH keys. The term often comes up when you&#x27;re trying to login or use a cloud service outside a web browser. It&#x27;s also a term associated with connecting from one machine to another.

                    <span>An array is a common data structure that holds items of the same type, in Typescript, unlike other languages, an array doesn&#x27;t have a fixed length. Also, in Typescript, you don&#x27;t have to re-organize all elements of an array when makings operations like insert or delete.

Elements are the items stored in an array
Index is the location of an element in an array, it goes from 0 to (array length - 1)




/** An array can be written like this **/

const numbers: number[] &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4]
const names &#x3D; string[] &#x3D; [&#x27;Snake&#x27;, &#x27;Ocelot&#x27;, &#x27;Otacon&#x27;, &#x27;Naomi&#x27;]

/** Also can be written using a generic array type, Array **/

let list: Array &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4]
let list: Array &#x3D; [&#x27;Snake&#x27;, &#x27;Ocelot&#x27;, &#x27;Otacon&#x27;, &#x27;Naomi&#x27;]

Traverse - Print all array items one by one
/** 3 ways to iterate an array **/

for(let i&#x3D;0; i {
    console.log(item)
})

Insertion - Add an item
/** add to the end **/
array.push(5)

/** add to the beginning **/
array.unshift(0)

/** add in a specific index position **/
array.splice(3, 0, 8) // add 8 in the index 3

Deletion - Remove an item
/** remove from the end **/
array.pop()

/** remove from the beginning **/
array.shift()

/** remove from a specific index position **/
array.splice(2, 1) // remove from index 2

Update - Update an item
/** update element in position 1 **/
array[1] &#x3D; 7

Search - Search by an item
/** you can traverse an array to find an element by its value, or simply use the .find() function **/

const item &#x3D; array.find(item &#x3D;&gt; item &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 3) // search by an item with value 3

All above operations can be performed on strings to solve problems like count the occurrences of a character in a string:
let str &#x3D; &quot;aabbccdd&quot;
let occurrences &#x3D; 0

for(let i&#x3D;0; i &lt; str.length; i++) {
    if(str[i] &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;c&quot;) {
        occurrences++
    }
}

console.log(occurrences) // prints 2</span>

The former is used to bind together a FormControl from Forms package and native DOM elements. The latter is used to implement validation logic. They can exist independently of each other, but in this article we’ll implement both using a single directive. Our directive will add the following functionality to the application:
Conversion between input value and control value
Validation for invalid date
If you’re using ControlValueAccessor for the first time, I would recommend going through this article first: Never again be confused when implementing ControlValueAccessor in Angular forms. 
We will first create a directive and handle conversion between UI and control value.

Organizations at GSoC work within Operating Systems to Web to Cloud and even applications within Science and Medicine thereby covering almost the entire spectrum of Computer Science.
I got selected by Rocket.Chat.

Rocket.Chat is the ultimate communication platform for teams — say an open-sourced Slack with a different business model.
It offers web and phone based communication platforms, integrated omnichannel features and even has an App Store of its own where you can publish and monetize apps that run on Rocket.Chat!

                    <span>A useful feature in TypeScript that I seemed to have glossed over in my learnings has been &#x27;documentation comments&#x27;.
In short, they enable you document functions in a clean and simply way and is understood by modern code editors such as VS Code.
Take the below function to demonstrate:
/**
 * Adds 2 numbers together
 *
 * @param value1 - The first number
 * @param value2 - The second number
 * @returns Returns the sum of 2 numbers
 *
 */
const sumIt &#x3D; (value1: number, value2: number): number &#x3D;&gt; {
  return value1 + value2;
}

If you open this in VS Code as a .ts file, then hover over your function name, you get the following interation:

Similarly, if you simply hover over one of the function arguments, you get the documentation comment specific to that argument:

To close, I find this a pretty awesome feature for situations where you may have a particularly complex function, where some human readable and interactive comments can really help to self-document and reduce complexity.</span>

                    <span>This is a concept that really drives home how nice it is when your entire stack is written in the same language. I am using node/typescript on the backend which means I can share stuff between the ui and api.
I have a separate repo that holds common stuff like error codes, request payloads and response payloads:
// Contracts
export interface SearchProductsRequest {
  page: number;
  q: string;
}

export interface SearchProductsResponse {
  nextPage: number;
  products: Product[];
}

Then I can use that to bridge the gap between api and ui:
// API
async function searchProductsApi(
  req: Request,
  res: Response
) {
  // req.query is strongly typed
  const result &#x3D; await search(req.query);

  // res.send will throw a ts error if result doesn&#x27;t match the response
  res.status(200).send(result);
}

// UI
// (driver is a simple wrapper around the fetch api)
async function searchProducts(args) {
  // data will be strongly typed
  const { data } &#x3D; await driver({
    url: &quot;/products&quot;,
    // will throw a ts error is args doesn&#x27;t match the request
    data: args,
  });
}

Now both sides of my application can have confidence that they will be receiving/sending the same payloads!</span>

                    <span>Step 1 - Install dependency
npm i ng-recaptcha --save

Step -2 Open app.module.ts and add below import-
import { RecaptchaModule } from &#x27;ng-recaptcha&#x27;;

Also add this to imports -
imports: [RecaptchaModule,],

Step 3 - Open that component where you want to add human verification reCAPTCHA and then add below code -

yourcomponentname.component.html
 

yourcomponentname.component.ts
public resolved(captchaResponse: string) { 
console.log(&#x60;Resolved captcha with response: ${captchaResponse}&#x60;); // Write your logic here about once human verified what action you want to perform 
}

Step 5 - This siteKey will work on localhost, you must have to generate your own siteKey, for this please visit google.com/recaptcha and add your domain and generate key, it&#x27;s very simple and then replace the new key to markup of step3.  
All done.</span>

This guide aims to do that for 2021, with the best in class tooling at this time. That said when using modern advanced tooling, you can and will run into some compatibility problems so this guide might be slightly esoteric for you.
This guide is really optimized towards typescript monorepos that also contain packages that can be deployed but really should work for any typescript monorepos.
For this guide, we will be using pnpm but this should mostly work the space with yarn just swap out pnpm workspaces with yarn workspaces. (This will likely not work well with npm and …</span>

                    <span>One of the most challenging things in software development is state management. Currently there are several state management libraries for Angular apps: NGRX, NGXS, Akita... 
But what if you don&#x27;t want to learn, setup, and deal with all the boilerplate for a simple project, what if you want to manage state by only using tools you already know well as an Angular developer.
In this write up, I&#x27;ll show you a simple way of managing state by only using RxJS and Dependency Injection with NgSimpleState.

                    <span>We’re Fly.io. We take container images and run them on our hardware around the world.  It’s pretty neat, and you should check it out; with an already-working Docker container, you can be up and running on Fly in well under 10 minutes.
Even though most of our users deliver software to us as Docker containers, we don’t use Docker to run them. Docker is great, but we’re high-density multitenant, and despite strides, Docker’s isolation isn’t strong enough for that. So, instead, we transmogrify container images into Firecracker micro-VMs.
Let&#x27;s demystify that.
They do their best to make it look a lot more complicated, but OCI images — OCI is the standardized container format used by Docker — are pretty simple.  An OCI image is just a stack of tarballs.

                    <span>Nmr






Nmr (Node module resolver) is a command line utility that stores npm modules in a safe place and prevetn your from installing the same module for different projects again and again.
nmr is aimed for reducing the space hogged by the node_modules folder in ever node.js project.
To install nmr, enter the following command in the terminal:
npm install -g @svel-ai/nmr@latest

To use nmr you have to install package globally, and then add them to your project.
For example, if you want to use the commander module in your project, you will have to install the commander module to your system through the following command:
nmr install commander

The above command can be run form anywhere in the terminal.
To use the module in your project, run the following command inside of your project directory:
npm init -y
nmr add commander

That&#x27;s it. Your ready to use commander. You can use it in your project and import it normally
const { program } &#x3D; require(&quot;commander&quot;);
// import { program } from &quot;commander&quot; // If you are using ES6 syntax
// ...

                    <span>In this article we are going to learn how to configure multiple environments in a single React application. For example, you might want your dev environment connected to your dev API Endpoint, QA to QA endpoint and production to a production endpoint. We could solve this by using a single .env file but, each time you push your code to specific environments you need to remember to change the endpoint values, which is a slight headache and can be error prone. Let’s see how we can solve this!
 
First, get the package env-cmd from npm by running
npm install — save-dev env-cmd
Next, create your environment specific .env files. In this example, I’ve created a folder named “environments” in my root directory (same level as package.json). Important the environment variables MUST start with REACT_APP_ . Read more here.
REACT_APP_API_END_POINT&#x3D;&#x3D;http://my-dev-url.com

Please note .dev.env, .qa.env and .prod.env are three separate files in the environments folder. See below

Next, update the package.json . Update the scripts portion of your package.json to include the following:
“scripts”: {


Next start your local/dev react application by running
npm run start:dev
You can test your env variable in your app by doing the following
console.log(process.env.REACT_APP_API_END_POINT);
For QA and Production build replace the command npm run build to the newly added environment specific command npm run build:qa or npm run build:prod respectively. (For example, if you are on AWS, edit the buildspec on Codebuild and replace npm run build with npm run build:qa or npm run build:prod)

                    <span>Sometimes you want to populate more than one level deep a schema using mongoose. i will share with you today how i use pure mongoose populate method to access more than one level deep data relation.
Suppose you have a User model that has many Posts and each post has Category.
Here we are going to retrieve a user with all posts that are not deleted with the category name and description populated.
import * as mongoose from &#x27;mongoose&#x27;;
import { Schema } from &#x27;mongoose&#x27;;

// Category schema
export const categorySchema &#x3D; new Schema({
    categoryName: {type: String, unique: true},
    description: {type: String},
    isDeleted: {type: Boolean, default: false}
}, {timestamps: true});

// Post schema
const postSchema &#x3D; new Schema({
    title: { type: String },
    description: { type: String },
    category: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: &quot;Category&quot;},
    isDeleted: { type: Boolean, default: false }
});

// User schema
const userSchema &#x3D; new Schema({
    username: { type: String, unique: true },
    email: { type: String, unique: true },
    posts: [
     { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: &quot;Post&quot; }
    ]
});

export const Category &#x3D; mongoose.model(&#x27;Category&#x27;, categorySchema);
export const Post &#x3D; mongoose.model(&#x27;Post&#x27;, postSchema);
export const User &#x3D; mongoose.model(&#x27;User&#x27;, userSchema);

// Query to get all posts with the category 
const userWithPosts &#x3D; await User.findById(id).populate({
   path: &#x27;posts&#x27;,
   model: Post,
   match: { isDeleted: false },
   populate: {
      path: &#x27;category&#x27;,
      model: Category,
      select: &quot;categoryName description&quot;
   }
}).exec();

                    <span>It is best practice to hide your configuration details and not include them in version control for the sake of security and independence of project instance. Getting straight to the point here is how to do it using python decouple library.  
Install decouple pip install python-decouple or [https://pypi.org/project/python-decouple/].
Create file named .env or .ini under the route of your project.
Add ignore for .env if you are using git.
Retrieve the settings by importing decouple into the settings.py file and replacing variables to hide with config.
5 . Test the application
This is how our initial exposed settings.py looks like before exclusion.

Here&#x27;s a quote from the official HIPAA requirement for Transmission Security.
A covered entity must implement technical security measures that guard against unauthorized access to e-PHI that is being transmitted over an electronic network.
For those of you who are not familiar with HIPAA, it&#x27;s a very strict regulation that requires protecting medical records and other personal health information (PHI). 
Most startup companies that develop a product for the medical-healthcare sector, aspire to become HIPAA compliant.

We also got a glance on the things that are to come in the coming year. I particularly enjoyed the sessions around .NET and Azure PaaS/FaaS! You can catch up on all the content on demand here. 
In one of these sessions, I saw Maria Nagagga and Stephen Halter present a very minimalistic API built with .NET 6 and C#10. There are some exciting announcements around the new version of .NET and many language improvements. I have to admit that the new .NET 6 (currently in Preview 4) looks a lot like a barebones Node.js API which is great since we, the developers, have to write a lot less code to achieve what we need. Less code &#x3D;&#x3D; less bugs!

                    <span>There&#x27;s a ton of HTML multi-step form examples out there: see https://csshint.com/multi-step-html-forms/ for instance. So why create another one? Simply put, I couldn&#x27;t find a form that satisfied my two main requirements:
1) Responsive. The form should look good on a phone, a desktop, and everything in between. It&#x27;s 2021 and most web traffic now goes  through mobile devices, so making your pages responsive should be a top priority.
I was also looking for the following:
Here&#x27;s what I came up with:




The labels will disappear when there isn&#x27;t enough horizontal space for them, but the form isn&#x27;t smart enough to figure out the perfect breakpoint on its own: you&#x27;ll have to manually specify that value in multi-step-nav.css. 
Why add next and previous buttons in each step instead of reusing the same buttons everywhere? Doing it like this actually helps with the tabbing behavior: if you&#x27;ve tabbed to a next/previous button and press Enter, tabbing again will move you to the top of the new section, instead of tabbing out of the form towards the bottom of the document.
There&#x27;s one accessibility feature I couldn&#x27;t seem to figure out, however. When using NVDA (the most popular desktop screen reader according to the latest WebAIM survey) in browse mode, using the down arrow after pressing the Next or Previous button won&#x27;t start reading at the top of the newly selected section. Anyone out there know how to fix this? 🙂

                    <span>You are part of a rescue operation for a lost boat in the sea.
You have a radar capable of telling you if a boat is in a specific region.
Your goal is to save the crew by coding a function that will return the location of the boat
This was a coding interview question that I was asked when I was searching for my first programming job. We&#x27;ll have a look at how we can solve it and we&#x27;ll learn how to implement a binary search algorithm in JavaScript along the way.
The task is clear but the interviewer shared a couple more details about the problem:
For simplification purposes, consider the sea is a rectangle grid divided in square cells.
Given inputs: dimensions (width and height) of the sea.
Expected output: location (cell coordinates) of the boat.

It provides the best viewing experience with core interactions such as zooming, scrolling, text search, text selection, and copying. The thumbnail, bookmark, hyperlink, and table of contents support provide easy navigation within and outside the PDF files. The PDF Viewer component was developed from the ground up to be lightweight, responsive, modular, and touch-friendly.
*Note: * This PDF Viewer control requires a server-side back end Web API service to render PDF content.

You could have come across this in your browser or IDE when you search for something, the matching items will be highlighted to point you to the exact place of occurrence.
Here is what we are going to build in this post. A very simple and straightforward highlight directive in Angular. We see something similar in chrome dev tools.
The idea is pretty simple. We just have to match the searched term and somehow wrap the matched text in a span or mark (ref) tag so that we can style them later according to our needs.
We are going to use Regex to find matches in our paragraph. Regex makes it very simple to do operations like this on strings. The directive…</span>

Can an Angular application store tokens in localStorage?
– Yes, of course! LocalStorage is persistent storage, so the token is available to all tabs and windows. It even survives a browser restart.
– No, absolutely not! LocalStorage is insecure, and an attacker will be able to steal the token.

                    <span>What is DOCKER?
Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.
What is GUI ?
The graphical user interface is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.
Lets Directly Jump to Practicles : 
Docker Engine Must be Installed in the Base OS / Host .
To confirm whether docker is installed or not we can use :
Docker Engine must be in running state .
[root@os]~# systemctl status docker

We must have a docker image to execute our task .
[root@os]~# docker pull centos:latest
We will now create a Dockerfile in which we will specify our Requirements for our own custom Image
[root@os]~# vim Dockerfile 
FROM centos:latest

[root@os]~# docker build -t firefox:v1 .

docker build will help us to make our own customized image with tag firefox:v1

[root@os]~# docker run -it --name task2 -e DISPLAY&#x3D;$DISPLAY --net&#x3D;host firefox:v1

$DISPLAY &#x3D;&#x3D; Enivornment Variable for our Display :0 is the main display.
[root@os]~# firefox

[root@os]~# jupyter notebook

In Addition to firefox i used jupyter notebook as a GUI APP.

Meus objetivos serão os seguintes:
Usar o Node.js para acessar dados financeiros relacionados a preços de títulos do Tesouro Direto;
Criar um mecanismo para de forma sistemática checar o preço dos títulos (minuto a minuto, ou hora por hora...);
Usar o Zenity para exibir uma notificação com o preço corrente do título.
As informações do Tesouro Direto podem ser achadas aqui. Além disso, se apertarmos o F12 e checarmos a aba Network, veremos o seguinte json sendo recebido pelo browser:

Example, one interface attached to an application machine can act as a receiving endpoint for application-bound traffic and another network interface can act as a communication interface with the database / data layer. This scenario can be visualised as :

Now, lets see how this can be implemented. I am going to use Azure for demonstration.
In Azure, private networks are referred to as &#x27;Virtual Networks&#x27; and sub-networks as &#x27;Subnets’
Our virtual network&#x27;s address space is : 10.0.16.0/22.

So what is Nginx? As per nginx.com: 
Nginx is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.
So in short, Nginx is a web server that has many capabilities in serving the content on server to the users.
You have to check that the server you want to install Nginx on is properly configured before proceeding so you can install and configure Nginx without any future issues. You can re…</span>

Como ficou decidido que o objetivo era se tornar um dev front-end, agora precisava desvendar o caminho das pedras para conseguir chegar a terra sonhada. 
Pra isso, precisava responder algumas perguntas como:
- Certo, mas por onde eu começo?
- Tem algum curso bom?
- Quais são as melhores escolas?
Saí em busca das respostas, na maravilhosa rede internética mundial de computadores e como nada é simples, muito menos na vida de um newbie, todos os lugares respondiam coisas diferentes.
Mas tinha um consenso. Quer ser Front-End? Aprenda HTML5, CSS e JavaScript. É isso, simples assim, agora voa assombração, se vira.
Mas onde, caral@#%, vou iniciar essa jornada? 🤯

                    <span>While web builders have been around for a long time, it wasn’t until recently that they became practical for professional use. Closing the gap between design and code has become the north star for many companies and we are seeing a wave of tools that deliver on this promise.</span>

                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata</span>

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
