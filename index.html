                    <span>Data quality is a massive problem for many companies. 
Lack of data quality can lead to wasted marketing efforts, lost revenue, and customer frustration.
Data Quality Assessments are the answer! With this tool, you&#x27;ll be able to identify potential problems with your data before they become an issue. This will save you time and money in the long run by avoiding costly mistakes that could have been avoided if caught early enough. You can also use these assessments to improve your current processes so that there&#x27;s less chance of errors happening in the future.
In this article, I&#x27;ve explained the six dimensions of data quality and the data quality assessment process.

                    <span>RxJS 7 has shipped! For us Angular developers, it unfortunately did not ship in time for Angular 12.
I&#x27;ve summarized key takeaways from Ben Lesh‚Äôs talk from RxJS Live Asia and his slides below. Lesh is a member of the RxJS core team and formerly worked at Google on the Angular team.
Lesh said while RxJS 7 was ‚Äúa bit faster,‚Äù the big improvement for the new version is its bundle size. RxJS 7 is 53% the size of RxJS 6. If your app used every operator in version 6, that would require 52 KB, but the same thing in RxJS 7 requires just 19 KB.
‚ÄúThis was done via a refactor, a hundred-point improvement of going around and individually moving around code, keeping the same tests, keeping the same code, and moving things around slowly but surely until we got to a place where we could see daylight and‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>The Azure AD provider for Terraform can be used to manage your Azure Active Directory resources declaratively. This allows you to do things like:
Automatically provision users and make sure they belong to the correct groups.
Manage Azure compute permissions via Azure AD groups.
The following example shows how to use the Azure AD provider to create a group in Azure AD:
terraform {
 required_providers {
   azuread &#x3D; {
     source  &#x3D; &quot;hashicorp/azuread&quot;

 }
}

resource &quot;azuread_group&quot; &quot;test&quot; {
 display_name &#x3D; &quot;Test Group&quot;

The terraform section at the start is used to specify the version of the provider that we want to use, and the resource azuread_group test block defines our group.

                    <span>üìö Learn what ID and access tokens are and how to correctly use them in the OpenID Connect and OAuth context.



  
  
  
&quot;Let‚Äôs use a token to secure this API call. Should I use the ID token or the access token? ‚Äãü§î The ID token looks nicer to me. After all, if I know who the user is, I can make better authorization decisions, right?&quot;
Have you ever found yourself making similar arguments? Choices based on your intuition may sound good, but what looks intuitive is not always correct. In the case of ID and access tokens, they have clear and well-defined purposes, so you should use them based on that. Using the wrong token can result in your solution being insecure.
&quot;What changes after all? They are just tokens. I can use them as I see fit. What‚Äôs the worst that could happen?&quot;
Let‚Äôs take a closer look at these two types of tokens to better understand their role in authentication and authorization processes.
An ID token is an artifact that proves that the user has been authenticated. It was introduced by OpenID Connect (OIDC), an open standard for authentication used by many identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and, of course, Auth0. Check out this document for more details on OpenID Connect. Let&#x27;s take a quick look at the problem OIDC wants to resolve.

Here, a user with their browser authenticates against an OpenID provider and gets access to a web application. The result of that authentication process based on OpenID Connect is the ID token, which is passed to the application as proof that the user has been authenticated.
This provides a very basic idea of what an ID token is: proof of the user&#x27;s authentication. Let‚Äôs see some other details.
An ID token is encoded as a JSON Web Token (JWT), a standard format that allows your application to easily inspect its content, and make sure it comes from the expected issuer and that no one else changed it. If you want to learn more about JWTs, check out The JWT Handbook.

                    <span>Today, with so many competitors on the market, you win your customers only if your work is efficient and super fast. Most of the businesses with quality developed products strive to adjust to the fast pace and manage both the development and operation teams. Therefore, we have DevOps. It is not only a job position but also a methodology like, for instance, Agile. But the difference is in the great optimization and speedy solutions this methodology allows teams to achieve.
But, what if it‚Äôs too expensive to hire your in-house DevOps engineers for that purpose? What if you‚Äôd like to have DevOps on the team and invest a fair share? Then, this article is your greatest asset.

Let&#x27;s learn it.
A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of World Wide Web(www........) application.

Front-end web development  is the development of the  graphical user interface of a website, so that users can view and interact with that website.

The back end refers to parts of a computer application or a program&#x27;s code that allow it to operate and that cannot be accessed by a user. ... The back end is also called the  data access layer of software or hardware  an‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>&quot;Simplicity as a Prerequisite for Reliability in Modern Software Development&quot; is a new, in-progress series of topics focused on the problems of drastically increasing complexity in the modern software development. Instead of trying to solve the problems of too many failing, complex and costly abstractions by adding even more complexity and bloat, let&#x27;s try to move into the opposite direction.
In his article from 1975, How do we tell truths that might hurt?, Edsger W. Dijkstra said &quot;Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability&quot;. These words are now more important than ever.

                    <span>Hey Everyone!, I will be sharing my fish shell workflow on linux and how to set it up for your productivity boost.
So you know about bash and zsh and how they work right? The fish shell is not like those shells. I mean they kinda have similarities but they do differ very much. ZSH can execute bash commands in a native as bash does but fish shell requires some editing to it specially when it comes to setting variables and exporting paths.

I usually work on the terminals only and for that I frequent switch between different directories, editing them in vim (I use neovim), etc. So for me having a built-in autocompletion for shell with syntax highlighting and is a plus point.

  A Yummy Analogy


Imagine you have ordered your favorite pizza of large size. You see, the pizza is divided into 8 slices. Assuming you are kind enough to share the pizza with 3 of your friends, each of you gets 2 slices each. Now let‚Äôs observe the following:
Cost savings: You can buy one whole pizza, and share it among 4 people
Isolation: What you do with your slice of pizza has no effect whatsoever on your friend‚Äôs slice.
Efficient pizza sharing: If one of your friends wants to eat 3 slices, and another one just wants one, it can be done.
Compare it with buying a large pizza that you are not able to eat all by yourself and 5 pieces of it going to waste, or a plate of dessert that you have to share with‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>If you&#x27;ve been coding in Node.js for some time, it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;ve used or at least heard of dotenv.
Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
It&#x27;s one of the must-have libraries which I install in nearly all of my projects, until I published typed-dotenv last year.
Instead of explaining the difference between dotenv and typed-dotenv, let&#x27;s feel it by seeing how we write my-api-client.js differently.

Much of the Node.js kernel is built around an idiomatic event-driven asynchronous architecture in which certain types of objects (called &quot;emitters&quot;) emit events that cause a &quot;listeners&quot; function call.
The following example shows a simple EventEmitter with a single &quot;listener&quot; that occurs when, for example, a sale is made
const EventEmitter &#x3D; require(&#x27;events&#x27;);

Simply deleting your sensitive files via the system menu is often not sufficient as professional data recovery tools may be able to restore them. In order to guarantee irrevocable deletion, it is recommended to erase the entire contents of your disk and overwrite it several times with random data. 
There are several data erasure standards, like the DoD 5220.22-M from the American Department of Defense, that define how data is securely deleted. In this article, I am showing you how to nuke all of your data according to such a standard.
The variety of hard drive erasing tools makes it difficult to make a choice.

                    <span>Almost every application requires some form of authentication, password handling or use of secure credentials such as API keys. You might not be security expert, but you should know how to deal with all these passwords and credentials securely to keep your application users&#x27; credentials and data protected as well as your own API keys and various token. 
Keeping these security elements safe includes, generating them, verifying them, storing them securely and protecting them from adversaries. So, in this article we will explore Python libraries, tools and concepts that will help as with exactly that!

&quot;Let‚Äôs use a token to secure this API call. Should I use the ID token or the access token? ‚Äãü§î The ID token looks nicer to me. After all, if I know who the user is, I can make better authorization decisions, right?&quot;
Have you ever found yourself making similar arguments? Choices based on your intuition may sound good, but what looks intuitive is not always correct. In the case of ID and access tokens, they have clear and well-defined purposes, so you should use them based on that. Using the wrong token can result in your solution being insecure.
&quot;What changes after all? They are just tokens. I can use them as I see fit. What‚Äôs the worst that could happen?&quot;
Let‚Äôs take a closer look at these two types of tokens to better understand their role in authentication and authorization processes.
An ID token is an artifact that proves that the user has been authenticated. It was introduced by OpenID Connect (OIDC), an open standard for authentication used by many identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and, of course, Auth0. Check out this document for more details on OpenID Connect. Let&#x27;s take a quick look at the problem OIDC wants to resolve.
Consider the following diagram:

Here, a user with their browser authenticates against an OpenID provider and gets access to a web application. The result of that authentication process based on OpenID Connect is the ID token, which is passed to the application as proof that the user has been authenticated.
This provides a very basic idea of what an ID token is: proof of the user&#x27;s authentication. Let‚Äôs see some other details.
An ID token is encoded as a JSON Web Token (JWT), a standard format that allows your application to easily inspect its content, and make sure it comes from the expected issuer and that no one else changed it. If you want to learn more about JWTs, check out The JWT Handbook.

Authentication Flows
I&#x27;ll go thorough how we can do this using Postman.
Client Credentials
Implicit grant
Authorization code grant
Refresh
Resource owner credentials grant

Backend AAD App
 For the first step all we need to do is fill in the name of the app and click register. In other flows you might also need to fill in the redirect Uri as well, this is so that the token response can go back to the client.
 Afterwards we need to add a scope to the app registration. It doesn&#x27;t really matter what you call it. Something meaningful is alw‚Ä¶</span>

Authentication
It is recommended to use an IdP server as a provider for user authentication to the Kubernetes API (for example, using OIDC) Cluster administrators are advised not to use service account tokens for authentication.
It is recommended to use a centralized certificate management service to manage certificates within the cluster (for user and service purposes)
User accounts should be personalized. The names of the service accounts should reflect the purpose access rights of the accounts.
Authorization
For each cluster, a role-based access model should be developed.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) should be configured for the Kubernetes cluster. Rights need to be assigned within the project namespace based on least privilege a‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>RxJS 7 has shipped! For us Angular developers, it unfortunately did not ship in time for Angular 12.
I&#x27;ve summarized key takeaways from Ben Lesh‚Äôs talk from RxJS Live Asia and his slides below. Lesh is a member of the RxJS core team and formerly worked at Google on the Angular team.
Lesh said while RxJS 7 was ‚Äúa bit faster,‚Äù the big improvement for the new version is its bundle size. RxJS 7 is 53% the size of RxJS 6. If your app used every operator in version 6, that would require 52 KB, but the same thing in RxJS 7 requires just 19 KB.

As AG Grid is written in Typescript, we can leverage Abstract Syntax Trees to extract type definitions and JSDoc annotations. We then use these to auto-generate our documentation from the source code itself. In this way, our documentation stays up to date!
Throughout our documentation, to explain how to use different features we must reference grid methods and properties and their interfaces. This meant we had hardcoded many Interface definitions into our documentation so that these could be read.
However, over time, we noticed some were no longer accurate, as the underlying source code had been updated but the documentation version was missed. This is not a good user experience fo‚Ä¶</span>

It&#x27;s one of the must-have libraries which I install in nearly all of my projects, until I published typed-dotenv last year.

MySQL is an open-source database management system, commonly installed as part of the popular LAMP ( Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP / Python / Perl ) stack. It uses a relational database and SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage its data.
This article will show you how to install and secure MySQL on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine.
-&gt; The operating system running Ubuntu 18.04 Linux
Updating the local package with apt-get command. Open a terminal window and run the following command:
sudo apt-get update

Please run the following command as sudo to install MySQL from APT-GET repositories.

User Account Management
Group Management
File Permissions And Ownership
Question arises why to have different user accounts? To answer this following are some points that we keep in mind.
Each user will have their own individualized private space.
Will help in distinguishing privileges among users.
Note : root user is a special user who is able to do anything on the system.
UID : It is a unique number that is assigned to the user account. It is also used for determination of user privileges and activity tracking.
GID : Indicates default group of the user.
Comment : Using comment field for contact information.
Home Directory : This is owned by a user and will be found on system under /home directory, except for root.

                    <span>What is AWK?


AWK is a command-line programming language primarily oriented to text and files processing - some might call it a tool -, simple yet elegant continuous lines of code can replace multiple lines of a more robust language like java or node without losing their intention.
In essence, AWK code is so simple that you can just throw it away after the execution or once your program has finished its work.
% awk &#x27;BEGIN { print &quot;Hello World&quot; }&#x27;
Hello World

But there is so much more than that; considering the constant need to process data files, once you have started with AWK, you will stop building complete programs to process CSV or log files for faster and more straightforward with a couple of instructions

After weeks of exams and dealing with imposter syndrome, I am back with another short article on &#x27;file commands&#x27; in Linux. These are pretty useful so take a look. ü§†
The &#x27;cd&#x27; command moves you into any directory you want. For example, if I have files located in the &#x27;Documents&#x27; directory, this is the command I would run:
cd Documents
and this would move me to that directory.

The &#x27;ls&#x27; command lists everything that is in that directory. To list everything in the directory, run this command:
ls -l

the &#x27;cat&#x27; commands displays what is inside a file. Simply run this command:
cat (name of file)

The cat command also can do other things. üëá
Using this command, you can also create a file.

Basically, we should be able to: 
retrieve all menus
retrieve one menu
create a menu
update a menu
delete a menu
Great, let&#x27;s dive in.
To create a new Nodejs project, we&#x27;ll first run this command on the terminal.
yarn init

It&#x27;ll ask a couple of questions before initializing the project. Anyway, you can bypass this by adding a -y flag to the command.
Next step is to create a structure for our project.

                    <span>Provides new standard objects and functions for working with dates and times, solving all previous issues with Date.
Date has been a long-standing pain point in ECMAScript. Temporal, is  a global Object that acts as a top-level namespace (like Math), that brings a modern date/time API to the ECMAScript language. 
Date, and the motivations for Temporal, see: Fixing JavaScript Date.
Temporal fixes these problems by:
  Providing easy-to-use APIs for date and time computations
  First-class support for all time zones, including DST-safe arithmetic
  Dealing only with objects representing fixed dates and times
  Parsing a strictly specified string format
  Supporting non-Gregorian calendars
Object Relationship

Code examples
Temporal.Now
Temporal.Now.instant() - get the exact time since Unix epoch
Temporal.Now.timeZone() - get the current system time zone
Temporal.Instant
const instant &#x3D; Temporal.Instant.from(&#x27;1969-07-20T20:17Z&#x27;);
instant.toString();  // &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;1969-07-20T20:17:00Z&#x27;
instant.epochMilliseconds;  // &#x3D;&gt; -14182980000

Temporal.PlainDate
const date &#x3D; Temporal.PlainDate.from({ year:  2006, month:  8, day:  24  });  // &#x3D;&gt; 2006-08-24

Ever wondered about bypassing a Google reCaptcha using some captcha solver techniques? If yes, your next question must be how? Well, I have a quick solution that will help you bypass a Google reCaptcha using Node.Js. You can solve Google reCaptcha v2 and v3 both with the help of this tool.
I am using 2Captcha library to solve the reCaptcha. It is a Captcha Solving Software that bypasses the captcha within seconds.
The process of bypassing a captcha is mentioned below-
Get the Captcha image from page in the form of data-sitekey parameter
Transfer the parameter to 2captcha service
The employee at 2captcha solves it
Once it is solved, we get the response
The response needs to set in the google reCaptcha texta‚Ä¶</span>

There are many more reasons that can be listed, but I won&#x27;t get into those here. 
Let&#x27;s just move forward toward ensuring that we can generate a secure Ethereum address. 
Despite all of the drawbacks and negatives listed above, there is a way to ensure that your Metamask wallet is a secure construction.

Back in the days, when creating an AWS account was a lot of overhead, common pattern was to have multiple teams sharing a single account. This created a demand to isolate teams from each other by assigning them an IAM policy that would grant access only to their part of the account. While it might have been possible (in theory) to create complex IAM policies to containerize resources by application or team, one fundamental problem did remain. Once you granted a right to create an IAM policy or role, you effectively granted admin level access to everything on the account. IAM has very granular ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Today, I released a new version of my website with only one new feature: syndication through RSS, Atom and JSON Feed. Even though by some accounts, RSS seems to be dead, I strongly believe RSS is an important feature in the fight to keep ownership over your own content while also increasing exposure. The way I approach publishing and sharing my content, is called POSSE:
Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere.
RSS is an important part of that strategy.
Luckily, I&#x27;m not the only one who values RSS. There are others
In this article I want to share how I implemented syndication feeds in my NextJS-powered website.

TypeScript - const assertion can prevent literal types from being treated as more general types, e.g. const config &#x3D; {light: &quot;ON&quot;} as const; will have light as the literal type &quot;ON&quot; instead of string, making it compatible with type {light: &quot;ON&quot; | &quot;OFF&quot;}. It&#x27;ll also make light readonly. More explanation can be found on the official documentation page. 


JWT - it can be signed asymmetrically with a key pair or symmetrically with a shared secret. The latter means all parties involved use one secret for both signing and signature verification, which means any party with the shared secret could have signed the JWS - something to be taken into consideration during implementation.


Design &amp; storytelling - good stories are engaging and help build empathy, adapting them to your audience and backing up the points with data could be helpful in getting buy-in during a design process. NN/g has an article on 6  rules for persuasive storytelling.

Basically, we should be able to: 
retrieve all menus
retrieve one menu
create a menu
update a menu
delete a menu
Great, let&#x27;s dive in.
To create a new Nodejs project, we&#x27;ll first run this command on the terminal.
yarn init

It&#x27;ll ask a couple of questions before initializing the project. Anyway, you can bypass this by adding a -y flag to the command.
Next step is to create a structure for our project.

Infinite Scroll is the ability to scroll through a large infinite list without compromising the performance of application. It improves user experience of the application. In this article I will cover how to implement infinite scroll with API in Angular 12 with the help of RxJS Operators.
A question comes in mind that how it works internally. It works like there is a big list say 10k items are there. Displaying all those items in once is not possible as it will break the application. And you can not put numbering pagination as that will look bad on the place or you have dropdown (dropdowns can not number paginations).
In that case you need infinite scroll. It loads only 10 (size is provided in configuration) r‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Introduction


Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 12 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
ng-recaptcha is a simple and configurable reCAPTCHA v2 and v3 component library.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the account. Access the site https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ and click on the button v3 Admin Console.

2. Fill in the field Email or phone and click on the button Next to login with your Google account and if you don&#x27;t have an account, just create a new account.

3. Click on the button +.

4. Fill in the field Label, click on the option reCAPT‚Ä¶</span>

  Generic CRUD Service


Before we start generating and writing code, let‚Äôs take a step back and see the bigger picture. The generic service should accept the following arguments:
the HttpClient is used for the HTTP requests
the class of model for creating instances
the path of the API endpoints.
Also, all resources should have 5 main methods related to CRUD‚Ä¶
Create - Returns a new resource.
Get all - Retrieves all resources as a list.
Get by ID - Returns a specific resource by ID.
Update - Updates a specific resource by‚Ä¶</span>

The same happen with our users work with our angular apps, we show the component, but the data is not there or the HTTP request take time, and they are waiting.
A good solution is show a loading until get the data, but if my users want the beers ready from the beginning ? No problem because Angular have a solution, The Resolvers.
The Resolvers help us to prefetch data, before the router finish start the transition between components, and store.
The resolvers are helpful to avoid show an empty component, and  have our data ready, before move to the component.

I also need to tell that there are some collateral effects, the main one is:
If you&#x27;re going to buy something all links in google shopping is a google ad, so they can&#x27;t be loaded you have to disable piHole in the manager address &quot;http://raspberry_pi_ip_address/admin&quot;
Several web pages have problems to load you click the link and Network Error, reaload, DNS Probe Error, reload, loads like normal

Create a new project
Create a new directory in your local file system and switch to it by typing the following
mkdir encr_decr &amp;&amp; cd encr_decr
npm init -y

Now install the crypto module
npm install crypto --save

Now make app.js.
Add following code to app.js
var Crypto &#x3D; require(&#x27;crypto&#x27;);
var secret_key &#x3D; &#x27;fd85b494-aaaa&#x27;;
var secret_iv &#x3D; &#x27;smslt&#x27;;

                    <span>Trivy Vulnerability Scanner


Trivy is a simple and comprehensive scanner for vulnerabilities in container images, file systems, and Git repositories, as well as for configuration issues in IaC. Trivy detects vulnerabilities of OS packages (Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, etc.) and language-specific packages (Bundler, Composer, npm, yarn, etc.). In addition, Trivy scans Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files such as Terraform, Dockerfile and Kubernetes, to detect potential configuration issues that expose your deployments to the risk of attack.
You can scan your Terraform configuration artifacts easily giving you the confidence that all is well with your configuration before deploying your Terraform (IaC) configurations. It is a free/open source tool by AquaSecurity. For more information go check out th‚Ä¶</span>

Measure twice and cut once.

We wanted the absolute best developer experience for the users. So, we settled after a few trials on a process that worked well for us.
I set up working sessions between the component dev and myself.
Every component started with its own markdown file to document the design.
We put down the ideal developer usage and experience, for the component.
We referenced our existing version, component tickets history and industry leaders.
The states and interactions were then considered.
Once satisfied, we sought feedback from the rest of the dev team.
We also sought the feedback of some key dev community members.
The final design would then be honed, ready for coded implementation.

One of the very first challenges I faced was making sure I can connect to the internet using my D-Link DWM-157 modem.
After doing some google search I came to know about ‚ÄòModem Manager GUI‚Äô and I was so happy. Opened my terminal and simply typed:
sudo apt-get update


Someone was smiling behind the scene and was whispering not so easy boy! Prepare for the next hurdle.
I was so happy it is a very nice GUI, everything is here for me i just a single click away to check anything. Everything was working perfectly in the GUI except the USSD code !

This is a straight to the point guide on how to make Docker CE run fully on WSL2.
PS: the title says right way, but it is just my personal opinion. I am not claiming that any other guide does it in a wrong way.
A full-fledged Docker installation on WSL2
Docker Daemon automatic start without any crazy hacks
Docker Daemon sharing between Windows and WSL (i.e. you cannot run docker from Windows PowerShell)
Docker Daemon sharing between WSL distributions
I will consider that you already have WSL2 working, and you are using Ubuntu as your distribution.
Install Docker CE on Ubuntu by following the official guide:

All modern motherboards come equipped with an integrated RAID controller, and top models may have several such controllers on board. That‚Äôs a different question, though, if such integrated controllers in consumer-class motherboards are ever used by an average user. Anyway, some motherboards do give a chance to setup a RAID array right inside your home PC.
Below are brief recommendations on building a RAID array on a home computer and a practical tutorial on assembling a PC for RAID.

DDoS is short for Distributed Denial of Service attacks and its main objective is to overwhelm a target infrastructure with more than it can handle on a typical day.

                    <span>A password manager is a computer program that allows users to store, generate, and manage their passwords for local applications and online services. A password manager assists in generating and retrieving complex passwords, storing such passwords in an encrypted database, or calculating them on demand. For the past seven years &quot;123456&quot; and &quot;password&quot; have been the two most commonly used passwords on the web. The problem is, most of us don&#x27;t know what makes a good password and aren&#x27;t able to remember hundreds of them anyway.
Most web browsers offer at least a rudimentary password manager. (This is where your passwords are stored when Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox ask if you&#x27;d like to save a password.) This is better than reusing the same password everywhere, but browser-based password m‚Ä¶</span>
