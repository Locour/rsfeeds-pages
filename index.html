                    <span>The world of Linux is large and complex. It&#x27;s highly competitive world of distributions, desktop environments, window managers, display managers, init systems, and ideologies to name a few. With this series of blog posts, I will be going to through all the basics of the Linux world and trying to explain, as best I can, what each concept or component is.
One of the first questions new users may ask themselves is what is a distribution. So let&#x27;s explore that and answer that question.
A Linux distribution is a collection of various software, modules, and configuration. Usually a distribution also has it&#x27;s own purpose and philosophy. There are many distributions that use the Linux system as a core piece of their system. Even the kernel can vary in functionality from distribution to distributio‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>If the C: drive is running out of space, we can move our WSL2 file system to another drive in a few steps.
If we are using an user different than root, we need to know it, running the whoami command (WSL side):

Also we need to know the distro name and WSL version, running the wsl --list --verbose command on PowerShell (Windows Side):

Knowing the username: equiman, the linux distribution: Ubuntu, and confirm that we are using the WSL 2 version, we are ready to...

All next steep need to be done on PowerShell (Windows Side).
First we need to shutdown WSL to avoid data corruption. Close all WSL terminals that are using it and then run the wsl --shutdown command.
Next we are going to create a backup from our Ubuntu linux distribution.
mkdir D:\backup
wsl --export Ubuntu D:\backup\ubuntu.tar

Don&#x27;t worry if you not see progress indicators. This can be take a while depending how much data you have. Maybe it&#x27;s good idea take a rest.

When finish, we need to to unregister the linux distribution from C: drive. It will also release the disk space.
wsl --unregister Ubuntu

And then, import again on our new disk. I&#x27;ll use D: disk as an example.
mkdir D:\WSL
wsl --import Ubuntu D:\WSL\ D:\backup\ubuntu.tar

By default Ubuntu will use root as default user, to switch to our user (equiman in my case) we need to run this commands.
cd $env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps
ubuntu config --default-user equiman

Ensure replacing equiman with yours.
Restart WSL running wsl command and it&#x27;s done.
That‚Äôs All Folks!

                    <span>It&#x27;s a common practice using node.js for front-end app development. In the Windows dev environment, the same exercise applies. If you use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can make use of the Linux environment for it. But what if you want to keep your dev environment on Windows 11? One of the most infamous errors you might be able to see is related to the node-gyp package. Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to discuss how to fix the node-gyp error on Windows 11.
node-gyp Package Dependencies


The node-gyp package is a part of npm, which is automatically installed while installing node.js. Therefore, you should be aware of your node.js and npm versions to get the issue sorted out. The latest LTS version of node.js at the time of this writing is 16.13.0 and npm of 8.1.0.

                    <span>Introduction


For all of our favorite projects, we&#x27;ve switched to Angular. We understand what Angular has to offer and how we can use it to create fantastic online applications. However, there are a few things to know about Angular that will help us use it more effectively in our projects.
Because data flow is at the heart while performing everything through Angular, change detection is something to be aware of. It will make it much easier to track out errors and improve our apps when working with large data sets.
Did we ever try to implement the Angular OnPush Change Detection technique in our project but run into some difficult-to-debug bugs and have to revert to the default change detection?
In this article, we‚Äôll look at Angular change detection, data structures, and the process of ma‚Ä¶</span>

At a high-level, an incident post-mortem answers these questions:

What will we do differently, so it doesn&#x27;t happen again?
What went well during the incident, that we should keep doing?

                    <span>AWS SSO and AWS Organization were released around 2017 and are probably the best way to manage AWS access at scale.
&quot;AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) is a cloud SSO service that makes it easy to centrally manage SSO access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications. It enables users to sign in to an AWS IAM user with their existing corporate credentials and access all of their assigned accounts and applications from one place.&quot;

This is a huge security and operational win, some highlights:
No need to rotate another new password in AWS IAM
2FA is already managed at your IdP (Google Workspace (Gsuite)/Okta/AzureAD) level
When a user is leaving an organization he is automatically removed access from the organization

Service role for CodeDeploy


CodeDeploy needs permissions to make changes to other resources to deploy the site. AWS managed policy and inline policy to get objects from S3 have been attached to the role. 
Security group for EC2 Instance


Allow HTTP traffic to the instance, so the website can be accessed from a browser. 
Instance profile for EC2


Permissions for the EC2 instance to make changes on other resources. The instance profile will use the same role that we created for CodeDeploy above.

                    <span>First of all, a Linux Service is an application that runs in the background and performs an essential task. One of the advantages to use a service is that you do not need to start it manually, you can configure it to start with the system using this command:
sudo systemctl enable 

Some of the most commonly used services are:
httpd
mysql
chronyd
sshd 
You can list all the services inside your Server using
systemctl list-units --type&#x3D;service

Also you can see the status of an specific service using:
systemctl status 

Let see an example:
[ernesto.lopez@test-vm ~]$ systemctl status chronyd.service

                    <span>TL;DR
loadkeys la-latin1
setxkbmap -layout latam,es
Introduction




I recently went back to Arch, and had some time figuring out how to set the Latin American keyboard, and it was quite easy, probably some minutes with the man pages and it would&#x27;ve been a cheese, okey so i got some info from stackoverflow and from the Official Arch Linux Wiki
Pre-installation



This is quite easy as you may load the keys with the loadkeyscommand (i.e loadkeys la-latin1) but when you install xorg and a desktop environment (Like XFCE or KDE) you may find that on a tty session your keymap is saved, but in the xfce session no.
Post-installation




(I am going to use XFCE as an example since it is my prefered desktop enviromnent).
xfce4-xkb-plugin but i wanted to do it all in the terminal so i found my way with coffee and patience. First, i could not set the keyboard layout to Spanish, so i googled how to do that, then i realized something was wrong, there where keys that do not correspond (Since i had a Spanish layout, not a Latin American, there are some tiny differences and no minor changes, but still, it annoyed me).
Solution post-installation



I used setxkbmap command with the -layout parameter, like this
setxkbmap -layout latam,es
# If you want it permament just do
setxkbmap -layout latam,es &gt;&gt; $HOME/.profile


And that&#x27;s it, i hope you Latin American brothers and sisters have found your solution! (Thanks to Terdon for this answer)</span>

January 1, 1983 is considered the official birthday of the Internet.
You can think of a protocol as a language, which allows  communication between two or more people.. Let‚Äôs say, people can only be able to share information among themselves if they speak the same language. As we all know every language has its own set of rules and grammar. In a similar way protocols also have a set of rules to communicate.

Let‚Äôs get back to the topic ARPANET, the communication between these computers was not completed until 1970, but as they began using the Network Control Protocol (NCP). NCP led to the development and use of the first computer-to-computer protocols like Telnet and File Transfer Protocol (FTP).

                    <span>Intro


In Part 1, I wrote a function that encodes a string of text in a Caesar cipher. 
In the second part of my series, I&#x27;m writing some files that decode an English string encoded with a Caesar cipher!
To start, I realized that my program would need to know how to encipher a string in order to decipher it, much the same as human cryptographers start by understanding how something is en-ciphered before de-ciphering.
So I popped the function from part 1 of my blog post into utils.js. Then, in app.js, I imported it:
const { caesarShift } &#x3D; require(&#x27;./utils&#x27;)

Now, since in my enciphering function I only allowed 26 possibilities (technically 52 counting the negative shifts, but those are also technically the same as the positive ones since I &#x27;wrapped around&#x27;), I could generate them by calli‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Have you ever heard about the SaaS platform for if a number is even? Well, I&#x27;ve decided to recreate a service like this of my own! üòÑ 
Not for the profit, of course - who would need the paid service for checking the parity of a number? üòÑ I wanted to create a full-stack project from start to end and then deploy it. It seemed like a great challenge that would require gathering all my knowledge, structuring it, and maybe even learning some new stuff along. So this idea of creating a non-real SaaS platform fascinated me!
So this is it! I present to you my latest project - is-even.eu. It is open-source, so go ahead and check the codebase.
The main idea behind this SaaS platform is that a customer can purchase a plan (different plans allow different API usage). He can then perform an analysis o‚Ä¶</span>

In this tutorial, we are going to build a web application using AdonisJS and integrate it with Materialize to create a real-time dashboard based on streaming data using standard SQL.
Materialize lets you define views you want to maintain on your data, just as you would with any SQL table, and then get the results in real-time, unlike traditional databases which frequently act as if they&#x27;ve never been asked that question before.
You need to have the following things installed before getting started:
Install Docker
Install Docker Compose
Install Node.js
Materialize is a streaming database that takes data coming from sources like Kafka, PostgreSQL, S3 buckets, and more and allows you to effectively transform it in real-time using SQL.

                    <span>Goal: Make our code resilient against changes over time

Software architecture is primarily the structure of the software components to be arranged in a purposeful and efficient system. The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human effort required to build and maintain software systems. One of the most effort-consuming processes in the software development cycle is to accommodate change. In software development, the primary method of handling change in the system is to create a separation of concerns between the layers of your software. This is where the Clean code architecture, created by Robert Cecil Martin (a.k.a Uncle Bob), shines.

                    <span>Server-sent events **are a new **HTTP API for pushing events from the server to the client. Unlike W*ebSockets, server-sent events (SSE* for short) are built on top of the HTTP protocol, so no need for ws:// URLs or additional npm modules. Server-side events also handle reconnecting automatically, so you don‚Äôt have to write code to reconnect if the connection is lost.

After discussing with plenty of developers during the last few days, I have realize that a more of them don‚Äôt know what ‚ÄúServer-Sent Events‚Äù (or ‚ÄúSSE‚Äù or ‚ÄúEventSource‚Äù) is. My aim here is to give you all the information you may need about Server-Sent Events.
With Server-sent events you are able to send one-directional events to a web page.

                    <span>Introduction


Hello there. Welcome to this week&#x27;s review, I am your host Habdul Hazeez.
This week&#x27;s review is mostly about malware. One news is about a bug and the other, a data breach that affected GoDaddy.
Grab a cup of coffee, and let&#x27;s get started.
Malware downloaded from PyPI 41,000 times was surprisingly stealthy


Always take a second look at your project dependencies. It won&#x27;t hurt.
Excerpt from the article:
PyPI‚Äîthe open source repository that both large and small organizations use to download code libraries‚Äîwas hosting 11 malicious packages that were downloaded more than 41,000 times in one of the latest reported such incidents threatening the software supply chain.
GoDaddy Data Breach Exposes Over 1 Million WordPress Customers&#x27; Data


No system is safe.

                    <span>AWS SSO and AWS Organization were released around 2017 and are probably the best way to manage AWS access at scale.
&quot;AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) is a cloud SSO service that makes it easy to centrally manage SSO access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications. It enables users to sign in to an AWS IAM user with their existing corporate credentials and access all of their assigned accounts and applications from one place.&quot;
Quote From AWS SSO page
This is a huge security and operational win, some highlights:
No need to rotate another new password in AWS IAM
2FA is already managed at your IdP (Google Workspace (Gsuite)/Okta/AzureAD) level
When a user is leaving an organization he is automatically removed access from the organization

                    <span>While developing an application, sometimes it requires generating a random but unique string, e.g. Password Generator, CSRF token, and many more.
There are so many methods to generate random and unique strings in PHP. For Example:
rand();
uniqid();
bin2hex(random_bytes(20));


function random_seed(){
  list($usec, $sec) &#x3D; explode(&#x27; &#x27;, microtime());
  return $sec + $usec * 1000000;
}

function getRadomSeed(){
    mt_srand(random_seed());
    $prefix &#x3D; substr(str_shuffle(str_repeat($x&#x3D;&#x27;abcNOPQRSTUVWXYZdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLM&#x27;, ceil(5/strlen($x)) )),1,5);
    $suffix &#x3D; substr(str_shuffle(str_repeat($x&#x3D;&#x27;wxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvPQRSTUVWXYZ&#x27;, ceil(5/strlen($x)) )),1,5);
    $randval &#x3D; mt_rand();
    if(strlen($randval) % 2 &#x3D;&#x3D; 0){
        $random &#x3D; $prefix.$randval.$suffix;
    }else if(strlen($randval) % 3 &#x3D;&#x3D; 0){
        $random &#x3D; $prefix.$suffix.$randval;
    }
    else{
        $random &#x3D; $randval.$prefix.$suffix;
    }
    return $random;
}

Execute:
$rd &#x3D; getRadomSeed();
echo $rd;

Just to be sure that this is not the only way to generate random strings in PHP. I am just sharing one of my ways to generate random strings.

It turned out that for various reasons it is fiendishly difficult to develop a JavaScript/TypeScript project that is broken up into multiple independent modules. To make this easier, I even created a little website, Goldstack, that generates modular starter projects.
However, I have always been somewhat unsatisfied with my solutions ‚Äî with them often involving clumsy workarounds and issues that would prevent them to scale up to larger projects. Now I believe I have finally arrived at a solution that has minimal remaining workarounds and works well for smaller and larger projects.

So what is boxing? well let me define boxing according to how I understand it.
Boxing is more like wrapping some value of type of x in a container that is type of y which has more functionalities that x can use - Some panda
Hopefully I did great job getting you confused, I think that&#x27;s what academic definitions are all about after all ü•≤
But let&#x27;s break down this definition, let&#x27;s assume that we have some value of the type x, for simplicity, let&#x27;s say that x is the well known type string, so our value may be name &#x3D; &#x27;ahmed osama&#x27;

Vite ships with a pre-configured build command that has many performance optimizations out of the box. It uses Rollup under the hood and provides an abstraction over the default rollup configuration. This makes it way easier to set up the build step without knowing all the internals of rollup.
For the sake of the example, I&#x27;m going to create a simple button component, but the build step remains the same for any number of components. In this example, I&#x27;m using the  syntax.
Component code:

import { reactive } from &quot;vue&quot;;

interface Props {
  primary?: boolean;
}

const props &#x3D; withDefaults(defineProps(), {
  primary: false,
});

const { primary } &#x3D; reactive(props);

                    <span>Sometimes it is much more convenient to build a monolith up.
For this we will make a simple Laravel, React, Typescript App. We will call it. Laravel-Guava
PHP/Laravel
Inertia/Breeze
React/Typescript
I am using a windows with WSL, ubuntu for this. using a mac should be the same experience. üòâ 
Feel free to fork it make improvements as you like.
Technology: Make sure you have composer, typescript, node, docker installed. If not I&#x27;ll add a few lines to make it work.
Step One: Install the latest version of Laravel and run it.
curl -s https://laravel.build/ | bash
./vendor/bin/sail up later composer-docker up is enough
npm install
npm run install
Initialize typescript in your project. this will create a ts config file. If that doesn&#x27;t work, install typescript here[https://www.typescriptlang.org/download]
npx tsc --init
these are my configuration for my typescript
{
  &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {
anytype




Install the dependencies


Configure Laravel Mix






configure  webpack.config.js to resolve typescript extensions
module.exports &#x3D; {
.ts and .tsx as a resolvable extension.
Then, let Mix know that it should handle the JavaScript code as TypeScript. Laravel Mix comes with built-in TypeScript support.
webpack.mix.js
-mix.js(&#x27;resources/js/app.js&#x27;, &#x27;public/js&#x27;)
That is it; you are all set! You can keep writing code the way you used to and utilize some TypeScript features and improve your front-end experience.
Run npm install for any additioal mix dependancies
npm run watch

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world‚Äôs most comprehensive and broadly adopted scaleable cloud platform. AWS offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers‚Äîincluding the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies‚Äîare using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster.
AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open source software development framework to define your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages.CDK is used to define structure of our application as Code. We can call it Infrastructure as Code which is best for scaleable

                    <span>If you ever started learning React and saw it&#x27;s syntax JSX, you maybe thought. &quot;This looks like HTML&quot;
And one day you want to comment something in JSX, and your first try would be to do:
function Component() {
  return (
    
      
      The quick brown fox ...
    
  )
}

And for sure your bundler started complaining, that your syntax is invalid, and then you search the internet, and realise that a HTML Comment is not valid in JSX, and you learn that you have to use a JavaScript comment.
Well in this blog post I will show you for learning purposes how to trick React to render a real HTML Comment in your browser in a few steps.

                    <span>Originally posted here!
To get or access the properties and methods of the div HTML element tag without having errors or red squiggly lines in TypeScript, you have to assert the type for the div HTML element tag using the HTMLElement interface in TypeScript.
The errors or warnings are shown by the TypeScript compiler since the compiler doesn&#x27;t know more information on the div HTML element tag ahead of time. But we know that we are referencing the div HTML tag and thus we can tell the compiler to use the HTMLElement interface which contains the declarations for properties and methods.
// get reference to the first &#x27;div&#x27;
// HTML element tag in the document
// with type assertion using the HTMLElement interface
const divTag &#x3D; document.querySelector(&quot;div&quot;) as HTMLElement;

We have investigated this request and here is the solution we have found.
The company is developing the backend API of a fitness App, powered by two autoscaling groups.
An Autoscaling Group contains a collection of VM instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management of specific component of your system.
You could run your API in a different autoscaling group of the Background Workers. So they can scale in and out indipendently based on their specific workload.

You can find the whole guide on his blog (quick guide):

Also, there&#x27;s around one hour video with details - including mistakes which I though was great for learning from such a great teacher and expert - on YouTube:




This is how my terminal looks like now :

Before publishing a package, we need to assign a unique version to it following the Semantic versioning requirements. In a system with many dependencies, if the dependency specifications are too tight or too loose, we are in danger of dependency hell, which prevents us from easily and safely moving the project forward. Semantic versioning was introduced as a solution to the problem by standardizing how versions are assigned and incremented. Consider a version format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). Bug fixes not affecting the API increment the patch version, backwards compatible API additions/changes increment the minor version, and backwards incompatible API changes increment the major ve‚Ä¶</span>

Complete System Scans. these scans are not much needed if there is on hand access feature on the system.it is well used if the anti-virus is installed for the first time or the security of the system is not updated for long time .this is implemented to ensure that there are no malware hiding in the most difficult locations and deep behind the codes of the system. Full framework scans are vital to scan your contaminated system

Virus Definitions - Antivirus software codes are based on the definitions to differentiate a virus from a genuine file and a malware. This the vital step to check on new virus definitions. The virus definitions clears of the of the marks of any codes which are considered as hazard in the system code.in the scenario of virus definition finds a file with marks of malware that matches accordingly, then that file is immediately terminated from execution and is isolated. The antivirus software runs through the malware, analyses it, and sends to lab to find out the origin and purpose of the malware in the system</span>

Intellectual property theft (also called IP theft) refers to someone illegitimately taking possession of someone else‚Äôs proprietary inventions or developments. In the context of business, and specifically in IT, IP theft typically refers to a competitor or malicious actor getting access to trade secrets or proprietary algorithms to be used to the thief&#x27;s own advantage.
The acceleration of digital transformation, which was exacerbated by the Covid pandemic, has stimulated the development of new technologies, consequently increasing the value of companies‚Äô intellectual property.

                    <span>If you are reding this, chances are you already use a password manager. I have been doing that for several years now. But I have to admit that my password manager has only run on my phone so far and I have always transferred passwords that I use on my PC by hand. Probably out of sheer laziness. Today, I use this blog post to finally synchronise my password database between any number of devices - and to show you how to do it. The whole thing not only makes dealing with passwords more convenient, but naturally also reduces the inhibition threshold to actually use the applications. This in turn improves the overall security of your accounts.

                    <span>Okay, so its not actually called &quot;specific Array combination types&quot;, but that was the best description I had for it, before I looked it up.
https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/typescript/typescript-tuple
I&#x27;ll come back to why this blew my mind today, but first, lets scroll back a bit, to some of my first steps into JS/TS programming. I started my programming career in Java, and one of the things that annoyed the hell out of me, was the fact that I could only have 1 object returned from a function (This was before the Pair class was introduced).
But in JS we can easily just return an array with 2 values:
const someFunction &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
    return [&#x27;Mathias&#x27;, 28];
}

And combined with some destructuring on the recieving, it was all nice and easy:
const [myName, myAge] &#x3D; someFunction();

Until today I never had to add types onto a scenario like this, usually when I work with arrays, I either just do a basic string[], or when its required in complex object scenarios: Array.
[string, number]:
const someFunction &#x3D; (): [string, number] &#x3D;&gt; {
    return [&#x27;Mathias&#x27;, 28];
}

I came across this when I working with Vue2 combined with TS, and was trying to create a v-for loop over a Map, but Vue2 did not support this, so I had to come up with a different approach that supported the same end goal.
So this is where the new tuples came in handy! Given an example with some data in a Map:
const map &#x3D; new Map();
map.set(&#x27;key1&#x27;, {data: &#x27;lots of data&#x27;});
map.set(&#x27;key2&#x27;, {data: &#x27;more data&#x27;});

I could then destructure it into an array like so:
const asArray &#x3D; ...map.entries();
// Yielding:
[
    [&#x27;key1&#x27;, {data: &#x27;lots of data&#x27;}],
    [&#x27;key2&#x27;, {data: &#x27;more data&#x27;}],
]

And in order to Type this we now have:
const asArray: Array &#x3D; ...map.entries();

Thank you for reading this far, hope you gained something from this post.</span>

                    <span>Problem


So, you have an angular material component, say a chip or a button like so:
 Done button&gt;

The designs provided to you show that the background colour of the button should be green and the text should be white.
In your corresponding styling file (.css or .scss), include the following style selector:
.mat-green {
 background-color: green;
 color: white;
}

And then, in your .html file, simply set the color input attribute to green as below:
 Done button&gt;

And voil√† ! There you have it.
Note: You can provide any name to the css selector and prefix it with mat- and set the name to the color attribute.</span>

                    <span>For as long as I can remember the recommended way to generate unique universal Identifiers in node.js was to the uuid module. These IDs are useful in all sorts of scenarios including for database keys, filenames, URLs, etc. Recently both node.js and the browser began offering nearly identical APIs that will generate 36-character version 4 uuids without any dependencies.
Available in Chrome since July 2021 and coming soon other browsers is crypto.randomUUID(). There&#x27;s a global crypto object that&#x27;s available on the global self property. You can use that to generate a UUID like this:
self.crypto.randomUUID();

The UUID it generates is a v4 UUID per the spec and ends up with a string that looks something like this:
&quot;0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d&quot;


You want to do the same thing in node? Instead of reaching for the uuid package. As long as you&#x27;re on version 14.17 or newer, you can do this:
const { randomUUID } &#x3D; require(&quot;crypto&quot;);
randomUUID(); // &quot;0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d&quot;

It&#x27;s cool see node and the browser adopting powerful APIs for crypto and improved randomness. I&#x27;ll definitely be reaching for these in the near future!
You can read more in the WebCrypto section in the MDN or the crypto section in the node.js docs.</span>

With the Angular CLI no longer including a complete out-of-the-box development solution, it is more important than ever to understand the tools at our disposal to improve the developer experience when building Angular applications.
Modern Angular Tooling is the term used to describe modern tools that will enable you and your team to build a comprehensive development environment. This development environment takes advantage of the latest improvements in the JavaScript ecosystem to improve productivity, consistency, reliability, scalability and developer experience when building Angular applications and libraries.
