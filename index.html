                    <span>Hello Coders üë©üèº‚Äçüíª,
Recently, I visit a crypto tracker site to check DogeCoin prices to see whether it going to the moon üöÄ

I was curious about how to build a simplified version on that site using React, other libraries, and tools out there.
Here is the link to my cool üòé project:
https://cryptotracker.ayeprahman.com/
So I did research to find which API to use and came across a free, reliable, and comprehensive API from the team ü¶éCoinGecko.
At the same time, my goal also was to focus to find a low-level‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>TLDR; The logic behind this is to pass the table filters as query params when exiting the table route and when trying to re-activate the table route add the {queryParamsHandling&#x3D;&quot;preserve‚Äù} directive after the routerLink so that the query params would be preserved.
Introduction

After implementing filters, another issue that arises is how to identify previously applied filters after a component containing a table has been destroyed. Here is a use case: We have a component showing a list of customers in a ta‚Ä¶</span>

I am going to explain about Nullish Coalescing (??) . Few days back while reading release details about Angular 12 I just got to know about this new word and how to write cleaner code in typescript. So, now Angular 12 view template is supporting Nullish Coalescing(??)
Let&#x27;s first understand the meaning of Nullish Coalescing (??). Then how it is supported in Angular 12 version view template. 
What is Nullish Coalescing (??) ?

Under the hood, the tool uses the same data feeds as AWS Spot Advisor and AWS Spot Pricing.
Compared with the AWS Spot Advisor, the spotinfo supports advanced filtering and sorting (also with regex), in-place spot prices, cross-region comparison, and multiple output formats (plain text, JSON, table, csv).

If you have many different projects, jumping between them, coding and pushing to production may be tedious. I know it is, because I have projects that I would rather not touch because then I would have to go through the hoops of updating the production. One project would require me to go into the production server, pull the latest commits from Github and then I would install the dependencies with Composer (yes, I would most often be doing backends with PHP so there are many shared hosting service‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Understanding Kubernetes can be difficult or time-consuming. In order to spread knowledges about Cloud technologies I started to create sketchnotes about Kubernetes, then I&#x27;ve auto-published a book and since now I&#x27;ve started a new serie of video! :-)
I imagined a serie of short videos with a mix of sketchnotes and speech.
I think it could be a good way, more visual, with audio &amp; video to explain Kubernetes (and others technologies).

                    <span>Working over SSH on a big beefy remote machine is a great way to extend the life of any laptop, but presents challenges when developing network-based services. Fortunately OpenSSH has a &quot;port forwarding&quot; feature which has been around for a number of years. Port forwarding allows the user to tunnel a port from the remote machine back to their local machine, in essence allowing you to access a remote service bound to port 8000 on your own localhost:8000.

The data in a cache is usually stored on fast-access hardware, such as RAM and its primary function is to increase data recovery performance.

Before starting to see about Strapi&#x27;s Content-Types, before looking at Next.js&#x27; file and route structure, it&#x27;s good to discuss Security.
A concern that usually is not followed up with due attention in certain teams, and that can cause a very high cost, when a project is put into production.
This article is another introductory article to the Next.js + Strapi stack, we will also cover TypeScript, Data Fetch, Layouts, CI / CD and Deploy, but first of all we will cover security.

                    <span>Why do we even need custom domain-specific languages?
First of all, we should define what do we mean by custom domain-specific languages.
In everyday programming, we have to encode real-world problems in code. We are limited by the power of expressivity of the language we are using. The programming languages are fairly low when it comes to model the real world.
Basically, we translate from a human language to a more basic form of language that a computer can understand.

From the previous post TypeScript - What Is All About And Why Should You Use It? we know that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and programming language. But how can you use it? If you worked with JavaScript in Front End you know that your code is executing by Web browser. In Back End, your code is running by Node. What about TypeScript?
The thing is that TypeScript is provided with a special program, tool - compiler. A compiler is a program that co‚Ä¶</span>

Amazon S3 is an object storage service that, along with many other features, allows you to create presigned URLs that enable external users to access objects within a given S3 bucket.
While there is a possibility to set an expiration date of the URL, there is no native built-in capability of making it a one-time use resource.
The following is an example of how one could add such capability using building blocks exposed by AWS.

Step 2. Using setTitle -

All together -

One thing that I find daunting in today&#x27;s web dev ecosystem is how to keep track of dependencies and plugin versions in all layers of our apps and, say, not miss a lot of versions for one tool or the other.
For example, in the project I&#x27;m working on, we have a front-end app made with React, a Java/Spring Boot back-end, a Keycloak authentication system, and so on.
