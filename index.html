                    <span>Making a web application accessible can feel like a daunting task, particularly if you aren&#x27;t used to taking accessibility into consideration.
The @angular-eslint repo includes a number of linting rules that can help enforce accessibility best practices within Angular component templates.
It is important to note, however, that these rules do not check attributes and roles set using the host section of the @Component decorator, or ones set using @HostBinding decorators.
While passing these rules isn&#x27;t a guarantee or metric for ensuring full accessibility, it is a step in the right direction.
For convenience, I&#x27;ve divided the rules I will be covering into three groups. The first group, general, covers ARIA roles and attributes. The second group, content, includes rules related to textual rep…</span>

I want to add an ellipsis to data that&#x27;s brought in from a service without having to use CSS&#x27; text-overflow: ellipsis feature, since it&#x27;s unreliable and could break overtime if not monitored during refactoring.
Slice Pipe



  
  
  Determine character max overflow limit



Determine max overflow by number of characters (instead of max-width)
Example: max overflow characters 20 (inclusive, aka 20 or more)
I use slice pipe where you add the start and end of the slice to the interpolated string






  {{ item.name | slice: 0 : 20 }}


span



Conditional span is based on data&#x27;s length

It is not a good practice to load thousands of records at once on one page, and there are many benefits to implement infinite scrolling.
Increase the time on our web site so that we can have faster operations
Make it easy to increase the depth of the page
The minimum number of clicks required
Better user interface
Best in mobile layout
One of the major advantages is that it reduces the bounce rate of a website
To implement infinite scrolling in Angular, we can use an npm package named ngx-infinite-scroll.

Well if you are a Java developer and if you want to become a full-stack Java developer then you are in a right place and if you are a Java beginner and if you want to become a full-stack Java developer then you are also in the right place.
In this article, I am going to give you a learning path to become a full-stack java developer so basically, we will discuss what are the skills I mean what are the tools and technologies that you are going to learn to become a full-stack java developer. 
Before looking to the learning path for full-stack java developer let&#x27;s first understand what is a full stack developer. Well full stack developer is an engineer who works on both client-side and server-side software. Full-stack developers have the capability to develop applications from start to end because a full stack developer has hands-on experience on both server-side technologies as well as client-side technologies.

  Purpose


The purpose of this article is to utilize NX workspace to create both a native application and a web application using the monorepo pattern. The application will track the grocery list items you create. In the application, you will create a grocery list. After creating the grocery list, you will be able to open the application either as a web application or as a native application to see when the items were purchased. You will also be able to mark the item as used. Finally, you will receive a notification when you open the app if you have a perishable item that has not been yet been used and was purchased more than 3 days ago.  You can see the code we use for this article on my Github.

                    <span>There are certain types of data that we will pull into our applications that do not change, or that change very, very slowly. In these cases, it’s best to load the data into the application once, when it’s needed, and not to ask for it again until the application has been refreshed, or until we decide that we should get the data anew for some other reason.
In my Angular application, I’m using resolvers to pre-fetch any data needed for a route before sending the application to that route. One bit of data that is not likely to change, or will at least change very slowly, would be my repository of state/province data. Though it’s technically POSSIBLE that the U.S. could lose or gain a state, it’s also very unlikely. Therefore, I’d rather cache that data locally in my Angular application the f…</span>

While these tools undoubtedly help accelerate building IT infrastructures, their limitations can impact DevOps’ ability to optimize and improve control of their IaC processes supporting future business needs.
In this article, you’ll learn about IT infrastructure limitations that IaC DevOps teams deal with on a daily basis and how Spacelift is able to get past them.
One of the most frequent challenges while using more generic IaC tools is the non-intuitive workflow driven by its reliance on pull requests. Some …</span>

Choice is good. We like it when our supermarket shelves are stocked with hundreds of varieties of breakfast cereal. We pick the smartphones we use and the cars we drive. The same should be true for businesses and the technologies they use.
Today, we brought the Auth0 Identity Platform to Microsoft Azure, giving our private cloud customers the ability to pick the right infrastructure provider for their needs.
This means a greater selection of regions. Microsoft currently operates in over 60 regions around the world, making it easier to comply with data residency and sovereignty requirements.
And if you’re already running your app on Azure’s cloud servers, you’ll benefit from a converged infrastructure,…</span>

                    <span>A lot of ink has been spilled about configuration file formats. Popular formats like JSON, TOML, YAML, and XML each have their advantages and drawbacks. There&#x27;s an alternative that should be receiving more attention: Typescript!
Before getting into why Typescript is a compelling choice for config files, let&#x27;s review the common file formats used in a typical web application today:
XML: Back in the late 90s to mid 2000s this was king both as a messaging protocol and flat file format. It gets a bad rap, but there is a lot to like about XML as a config file format, including great tooling support and a robust schema definition language in XSD. 
JSON: Extremely common as a data interchange format in REST APIs, and also very popular as a config file format. For a lot of developers this strikes t…</span>

Blockchain was born from the bitcoin revolution as the coding system or the technology that supports the entire structure of the virtual currency, and thanks to the great potential that has been identified in this system, other applications have been developed in addition to the financial one, which we will talk about later.
In simple words, blockchain is a distributed and secure database where all types of transactions can be applied. The great difference between the blockchain with any other type of codification is its operation.

                    <span>What is context switching? 


Context switching is a form of multitasking requiring developers to switch between unrelated tasks. 
Frequent context switching reduces productivity, decreases energy and creativity, and negatively impacts quality of work. Minimizing context switching can help developers better focus on their highest priority tasks, avoid mental fatigue, and reduce the risk of burnout. 
The concept of context switching originated in computer science. When computers switch between tasks, they need to carry out several intermediary tasks to stop the previous task and begin the new task. Each switch costs time and energy:
[Context switching] refers to the process of storing the system state for one task, so that task can be paused and another task resumed. A context switch can al…</span>

You just finished writing the new comments feature for your web app: you wrote the code, tested it, and put up the PR. You&#x27;re under a deadline and your next highest priority task is to add reactions to those comments.
But wait a minute - the reactions code will depend on the comments code, which isn&#x27;t yet merged to main. Which means you&#x27;re blocked.
If you&#x27;ve ever found yourself in this position, you know you have three options:
Work on something lower-priority while you wait for your comments PR to be approved (and risk missing the deadline).
Interrupt your teammate to ask for a faster review.

                    <span>Introduction
A bit of background: I&#x27;ve been using Linux both on my desktops and servers since the early 2000s. I&#x27;ll try to distill what I learned over those years into a simple and easy-to-follow guide, in a way that I would approach things if I had to start from scratch.
I&#x27;ll try to make things friendly towards new users - you should be able to follow the guide even if you have very little (or even no) experience with Linux. 
We&#x27;re going to start by going through the process of setting up a Linux VPS and then build upon that.
So, why even bother instead of going &quot;serverless&quot;?
Well, first, there&#x27;s no such thing as serverless, there are only servers controlled by you and servers controlled by someone else. In the long term, trading-off that control tends to come at a huge price.
By learning to run things yourself, even if you do end up going &quot;serverless&quot; on some projects, you&#x27;ll have a much better and deeper understanding of those trade-offs, limitations, pitfalls, and lock-ins.
Easy scaling promises, for the most part, are just that - promises. Even if they weren&#x27;t, it&#x27;s extremely unlikely that you&#x27;ll really need them. A lot of people would be very surprised how much you can get from a single Linux box.
Considering what you get in return, running your own VPS is really cheap (you can get a nice KVM-based VPS for a few bucks a month). 
But having full freedom and control over your server is priceless. With serverless options, you&#x27;ll always be severely limited in what you can do and what you can depend upon (and even that limited set of dependencies is subject to change at any time).
In the next post, we&#x27;re going to make a few important decisions about our new server.
Note: This is part #1 of the Essential Guide to Linux Servers in-progress series. You can follow me here or on Twitter for updates.</span>

This article is intended for intermediate level website developers and software engineers. I&#x27;ve tried to make it approachable for beginners but it&#x27;s really not for absolute beginners.
Website authentication can be a very confusing topic. There are a lot of considerations when thinking about an authentication system for your web projects. It&#x27;s overwhelming because authentication can be extremely simple or it can be a layer cake of individual systems that each build on top of each other.
In this series we&#x27;re going to start with no authentication and then you&#x27;ll add a very basic authentication system. Then you&#x27;ll progressively add and remove layers on top of it to make it a full b…</span>

                    <span>Node.js v17.0.0, the latest major version of the popular JavaScript runtime, has just been released. It supersedes v16 in the Current release line of the runtime. V16 is now in line to be promoted to the long-term support (LTS) channel on October 26, 2021, as it&#x27;s an even-numbered release.
Despite being a relatively minor update, this release brings several refinements to the runtime, including more promisified APIs, JavaScript engine upgrades, and OpenSSL 3.0 support.
In this article, we&#x27;ll take a look at some of the major highlights from this release and the implications for Node.js developers.
Node.js continues to promisify its core APIs as part of its strategic initiative plan. In the last few major Node.js releases, Promise-based APIs were added for the dns, fs, stream, and timers mod…</span>

The first things you&#x27;ll need are:
Node installed
Your favourite Code Editor/IDE
Once you have those setup, let us get started with nest.
npm i -g @nestjs/cli

Now we can use this to bootstrap our nest project, using the following command:
nest new 

The command should start scaffolding your app, select your preferred package manager and let the CLI setup and install dependencies.

Then navigate into your project directory and start the development server.
cd nest-beginner
npm run start:dev

Open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000/, and you should see a familiar message

To keep this tutorial simple, we are going to use nest CLI&#x27;s resource generator recipe for generating our resources. Go ahead and run the following command to generate the User resourc…</span>

This is post is about SvelteKit FIDO U2F Login.  FIDO U2F provides a way to beef up login security using a hardware USB token owned by the user.  In computing typically we authenticate ourselves (let the system know we are who we say we are) using three possible types of identifier.  These are: something we know (like a password), something we have (like a 2FA code generated by an authenticator app) or something we are (like biometric data generated using facial recognition or a thumbprint).  Traditionally, we relied on a password only, though requesting a second authentication type (two factor authentication or 2FA) or multifactor authentication (MFA) is now more commonplace.  FIDO U2F keys fall into the second category and make login…</span>

XML: Back in the late 90s to mid 2000s this was king both as a messaging protocol and flat file format. It gets a bad rap, but there is a lot to like about XML as a config file format, including great tooling support and a robust schema definition language in XSD.

                    <span>How authentication layers are built up to create an authentication system for your website.



  
  
  Audience


This article is intended for intermediate level website developers and software engineers. I&#x27;ve tried to make it approachable for beginners but it&#x27;s really not for absolute beginners.
Website authentication can be a very confusing topic. There are a lot of considerations when thinking about an authentication system for your web projects. It&#x27;s overwhelming because authentication can be extremely simple or it can be a layer cake of individual systems that each build on top of each other.
In this series we&#x27;re going to start with no authentication and then you&#x27;ll add a very basic authentication system. Then you&#x27;ll progressively add and remove layers on top of it to make it a full b…</span>

                    <span>TL;DR - Rename your directory build something else
Makefile
build:
    docker build . -t my-basic-app

Look. I have the most basic app, Dockerfile and Makefile. Why can&#x27;t it just run make build command properly as I defined in Makefile?
shyamajp@ubuntu:~/Projects/my-basic-app$ make build
make: &#x27;build&#x27; is up to date.

Let&#x27;s get rid of this stupid error. At the root level, you must have a directory named build. That&#x27;s why you see this unexpected behavior.
In my case, I can change outDir name from build to dist to avoid this specific conflict.
tsconfig.json
{
    &quot;outDir&quot;: &quot;dist&quot;
}

Do not name your directory same as Makefile target. Be careful with names like build and test, which are often used for both Makefile targets and directory names.
I know this is a noob question but I&#x27;ve done it a few times already and I thought I might as well document it somewhere for myself. I hope this helps other newbie folks like me.

                    <span>2020 Webpack &amp; Babel is de facto


This year there has been a big movement in build tools in the JavaScript community.

In 2020, Webpack, especially in combination with Babel, seemed to be the de facto standard for build tools.
However, in 2021, the popularity of a completely new development environment/build tool that does not include Webpack has skyrocketed.
Vite.
ESBuild that starts without build.
NPM Trend, you can see that Vite has overtaken the number of downloads of create-react-app since July.
The Next.js team has also responded by abandoning Babel and introducing SWC, an ultra-fast TypeScript compiler, in Next v12.
What does that mean for us React Developers?
The Vite default react-ts template lacked Jest and ESLint (Prettier integrated).
Jest comes pre-installed with React-Testing-Library, Hook-Testing-Library, MSW, and TypeScript support.
You can easily install and run Jest with the following commands, 
yarn
npx degit laststance/vite-react-ts-extended myapp
cd myapp
yarn install
yarn dev

npm
npx degit laststance/vite-react-ts-extended myapp
cd myapp
npm install
npm run dev

github: https://github.com/laststance/vite-react-ts-extended
so I would be happy if you could use it as a way to build a instant React+TypeScript development environment for new libraries or anything else! 💅</span>

                    <span>Introduction


With the stable growth of web projects, developers have found that they need some tools that will make maintaining and writing new code easier. There are various ways to help you to verify and validate code such as tests, contracts, typing, etc. We are going to focus on  type systems in different static typing languages useful in web development centering on comparison by a couple of parameters.
We are not going to look for winners or losers because decisions taken on the type systems in languages we are going to discuss didn&#x27;t come from scratch. If we were going to rate any of these languages objectively, we would need to take into account the whole ecosystem of language, history, advantages, and limitations that appeared in languages because of their design.

                    <span>The most part of applications written in JS nowadays uses at least few calls of Promises API, some of them uses es5 syntax, others async/await. But sometimes incomplete understanding of this technology(as in any other) can lead to unpredictable behavior, which can confuse uses, and take hours for you to understand the cause of the problem.
Spending too much time in writing JS code, i&#x27;ve found interesting case with promises: promises have an API which can lead to incorrect interpreting of potential result.
This is mostly related to classic es5 promise realization, but, alas, also affects async/await promises realization.

This is just my opinion as a newbie frontend engineer who was exhausted from googling the same thing every time I need it. But I hope this article can be a reference for you.
# Introduction
The story began when I decided to switch from Angular to React as my favorite and go-to framework in June 2021. Previously, everything is fine. I googled normally when I have to do some troubleshooting or just want to search for information related to my project using React. Everything changed when I started to feel tired of googling the same thing each time I need that information or code snippet.
A college friend suggested I make my docs site. Then, he also showed me his own docs site at base.sznm.dev. Like before, I asked him, &quot;Why did you make this? It&#x27;s just like you put your notes her…</span>

En esta publicación, veremos las nuevas funciones web que afectan la forma en que definimos el estilo en nuestras aplicaciones Angular.
En 2019,Sass introdujo un nuevo sistema de módulos, incluida una migración de @import a @use. Al cambiar a la sintaxis@use, podemos determinar más fácilmente qué CSS no se utiliza y reducir el tamaño de la salida CSS compilada. Esto hace que sea imposible extraer inadvertidamente dependencias transitivas. Cada módulo se incluye solo una vez, sin importar cuántas veces se carguen esos estilos.
Angular Material v12 incluyó una migración del uso de @import a @use para todas las importaciones en los estilos Angular Material Sass. Esta refactorización de nuestra Superficie de API de personaliza…</span>

FormData is an object that you can use for storing key-value pairs. It allows you to construct an object which aligns with an HTML form. This feature allows you to send the data, such as file upload using the XMLHttpRequest interface or Http client libraries.
You can use the following command to create the FormData:
const formdata &#x3D; new FormData();


HttpClientModule contains an API that you can use to send and fetch the data in your application from the Http servers. You can use the following command to import this module.

Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 13 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
Auth0 is an easy to implement, adaptable authentication and authorization platform.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)
1. Let&#x27;s create the account. Access the site https://auth0.com/ and click on the button Sign up.

2. Fill in the field Email and click on the button SIGN UP.

3. Fill in the fields Email, Password and click on the button Continue.

                    <span>Création de variables d&#x27;environnement linux pour une utilisation dans les scripts bash ou dans les commandes du terminal.
On commence par créer une variable locale directement dans le terminal
DB_SAVES_PATH&#x3D;&#x27;/home/Griff/dbsvg&#x27;
On check que la variable est ok
echo $DB_SAVES_PATH
Le résultat s&#x27;affiche dans le terminal. Ici il doit être: /home/Griff/dbsvg
On passe la variable locale en variable d&#x27;environnement
export DB_SAVES_PATH
On check que la variable est bien enregistrée en tant que variable d&#x27;environnement
printenv DB_SAVES_PATH
Là encore le résultat affiché doit être: /home/Griff/dbsvg
Une fois les variables définies en variables d&#x27;environnement, elles sont accessibles directement dans les scripts bash ou ligne de commande.
Exemple dans un export de base de données :
mysqldump ma_base_de_données -u griff &gt; $DB_SAVES_PATH/export.sql
Lister toutes les variables d&#x27;environnement
env
Supprimer une variable d&#x27;environnement
unset DB_SAVES_PATH
export MA_VAR - Passage d&#x27;une variable locale en variable d&#x27;environnement


printenv MA_VAR - Affichage du contenu de ma variable dans le terminal


env MA_VAR - Listing de toutes les variables d&#x27;environnement

                    <span>This is my first article on dev.to, so go easy on me!
tmux is an open-source terminal multiplexer for Linux operating  distributions. It allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single window. 
on the other hand, ZSH, also called as &#x27;Z Shell&#x27;, is an extended version of the Bourne Shell (sh), with plenty of new features, and support for plugins and themes. Since it’s based on the same shell as Bash, ZSH has many of the same features, and switching over is a breeze.
If your editor for developing and coding is vim or sth like that, the best solution for you is tmux because you can always switch between tabs in a breeze and edit the code at the same time.
But if you are like me and use VSCode as code editor, I recommend you to install zsh and even OhMyZsh to have some great features like: auto suggestion(Not recommended), syntax highlighting and etc.
So, both of them are great and offer you some helpful features. zsh is more like a handful featured terminal and tmux will bring your editor and terminal at same place to switch simultaneously!
you can use both of them or install zash on tmux!</span>

A message broker is a computer program that allows software, systems, and services to communicate with each other and exchange data, taking incoming messages from applications and performing actions on them.
By using message brokers, producers and consumers can communicate with the broker using a standard protocol for communication, with the broker handling all the data&#x27;s state management and tracking.
This means all consumer applications do not need to take on the responsibility of managing state, tracking, and the message delivery complexity of the message broker itself. Message brokers rely on a component called message queues that store messages until a consumer service can process them.
In this article, we’ll compare two Node.js message brokers: Apache Kafka…</span>

But aren’t containers meant to be safe and isolated? Well, kind of.

One of the most important security concerns for entities using AWS is securing their AWS accounts. Evidently, managing an AWS account with 5 users may be somewhat a walk in the park. However, as the usage of the account scales, and the number of users increases, managing account becomes trivial. Several policies must be put in place in order to organize access between different stakeholders. 
One of the most common security features is to enable Multi-Factor Authentication on the AWS account users.
In this tutorial, we are going to setup a process that forbids any AWS user from using any service without:
Setting up an MFA device.
Signing in using MFA. Any user that signs in without MFA must not be allowed to manage any resource on AWS.
In this tutorial we will perform the fo…</span>

                    <span>The new threats in software development are not only related to the specific company itself. The whole software supply chain is a target for attackers and it is really important to make sure that we put all our effort into securing each link because if one fails, everything will be affected.
Supply chain activities include each step of the transformation of raw materials, components, and resources into a completed product, and its delivery to the end customer.
Each step could be a complex process itself and cause a security incident.
The software supply chain is similar to other activities or industries. Some resources are consumed, then transformed, through a series of steps and processes, and finally supplied as a product or service to a customer.
In software, the raw materials are commo…</span>

                    <span>A few days ago I asked Twitter how would one solve the task of implementing a button component that can also display an icon. Is it by adding an icon property to the button component or by having a separate icon component nested inside the button? I also asked why would one choose one approach over the other.

Quite a few people replied with their pros and cons for both options. In this post I’m going to try and summarize the points mentioned there. I think that’s quite valuable to have as a reference in the future.

Convention - only one way to display an icon

Limitar o acesso aos metadados de uma instância faz parte de uma estratégia de segurança em camadas, que tem como objetivo impedir o acesso aos metadados por usuários/aplicações não autorizadas. 
Essa ação soma-se à utilização do IMDSv2.
Podemos utilizar regras de iptables para limitar o acesso, permitindo acesso a usuários ou grupos específicos.
O exemplo a seguir libera o acesso ao serviço de metadados da instância por todos os processos em execução na conta do usuário &quot;app&quot;.
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 --proto tcp --destination 169.254.169.254 --match owner --uid-owner app--jump ACCEPT

O exemplo a seguir impede o acesso ao serviço de metadados da instância por todos os processos, exceto os processos em execução na conta do usuário root.
sudo iptables --append OUTPUT --proto tcp --destination 169.254.169.254 --match owner ! --uid-owner root --jump REJECT

A ordem é fundamental, a regra de bloqueio deverá ser a última.
Obs.: O módulo owner do iptables só corresponderá à associação do grupo se o grupo for o grupo primário de um determinado usuário local. Outros grupos não são correspondidos.

                    <span>SSH config ช่วยให้เรา config option ของแต่ละ host เอาไว้หลายๆอันได้ ทำให้ตอนเรียก ssh ใส่แค่ชื่อ hostname ใน config ก็พอแล้ว
เวลาใช้ ssh เพื่อ remote เครื่องอื่น ปกติแล้วจะสั่งประมาณนี้
ssh user@hostname

หรือถ้ามี port ที่ต่างจาก ssh ปกติ (22) ก็ใส่ option สำหรับ port เพิ่มคือ
ssh -p 2222 user@hostname

หรือถ้ามี IdentityFile ด้วย ก็ต้องเพิ่ม option ไปอีกแบบนี้
ssh -i identity.key -p 2222 user@hostname

ตัวอย่างเช่นผมจะ ssh เข้า Ubuntu ที่ลงไว้ใน Virtual Box โดยใช้ vagrant ปกติแล้วจะสั่ง vagrant ssh ก็ได้ แต่ถ้าจะสั่งด้วย ssh เองโดยตรงจะต้องสั่งประมาณนี้
ssh -i ~/vagrants/ubuntu/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key -p 2222 vagrant@127.0.0.1

ทีนี้ถ้าเราจะใช้ SSH config ช่วยเราก็สร้างไฟล์ config ที่ $HOME/.ssh/config
จากนั้นกำหนดค่าแบบนี้
Host ubuntu-vagrant
  HostName 127.0.0.1
  IdentityFile ~/vagrants/ubuntu/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
  Port 2222
  User vagrant

ลักษณะ config file ของ SSH ก็มี key เช่น Host, HostName, IdentityFile, Port และ User แล้วเว้นวรรคด้วย 1 ช่องว่าง ตามด้วยค่าที่กำหนดให้ key นั้นๆ 
แล้วก็มีการใช้ indentation เพื่อบอกว่าค่านั้นเป็น key/value ย่อยๆของ key หลักอีกที
จากตัวอย่างผมกำหนด Host คือ ubuntu-vagrant แล้วก็กำหนดค่า HostName เป็น IP หรือ Domain name ของ Host ที่เราต้องการต่อ แล้วก็ค่า IdentityFile ไปที่ path ของ private key ของ vagrant ที่กำหนดให้กับ VM ที่ต้องการ remote ตามด้วยค่า Port 2222 แล้วก็​ User คือ username ในทีนี้คือ vagrant
เสร็จแล้วหลังจากนั้นเวลาเราต้องการ connect ไปที่ Ubuntu ใน VM ก็แค่สั่ง
ssh ubuntu-vagrant

เท่านี้ก็ได้แล้ว</span>

                    <span>This blogpost is about linux memory management, and specifically about the question that has been asked about probably any operating system throughout history: how much free memory do I need to consider it to be healthy?
To start off, a reference to a starwars quote: &#x27;This is not the free memory you&#x27;re looking for&#x27;. 
What this quote means to say is that whilst the free memory statistic obviously shows free memory, what you are actually looking for is the amount of memory that can be used for memory allocations on the system. On linux, this is not the same as free memory.
Of course free memory is directly available, actually free memory, which can be directly used by a process that needs free memory (a free page). A free page is produced by the kernel page daemon (commonly named &#x27;swapper&#x27;),…</span>

                    <span>Introdução


Provavelmente você já deve ter ouvido sobre &quot;processos&quot; enquanto estava mexendo em seu computador. A maioria de nós talvez só nos damos conta da existência deles em &quot;momentos ruins&quot;, por exemplo, quando alguma aplicação está travada e temos que &quot;finalizar o processo dela&quot;. Contudo, fora o conhecimento em saber como finalizar o &quot;bendito&quot; para você continuar exercendo suas atividades, algo importantíssimo também é entender qual é a real importância de um processo.
Quando estamos trabalhando em um ambiente multiprogramado/multitarefa, o Sistema Operacional (SO) é responsável por gerenciar diversos programas executados &quot;concorrentemente&quot;, controlando o compartilhamento dos recursos para cada um deles. Para que isso seja possível, todo programa executado deve sempre estar associado…</span>

                    <span>Introdução


Se você já faz parte ou tem interesse de entrar no mundo do hackvismo, provavelmente já deve ter ouvido falar do Kali Linux. Nessa postagem, eu pretendo falar um pouco sobre essa distribuição, e também, ensiná-lo como você pode estar criando um pendrive bootável no modo live com o mesmo, utilizando apenas a linha de comando do seu terminal. Sem mais delongas, vamos começar!
PS: Caso você não saiba o que é &quot;bootável no modo live&quot;, significa que você poderá inicializar o sistema operacional direto do seu pendrive, com isso, você não precisará necessariamente fazer a instalação do Kali Linux em sua própria máquina.
O Kali Linux é uma distribuição GNU/Linux baseada no Debian, totalmente open source, que é mantido e financiado pela Offensive Security. Ele é usado para pentesting, a…</span>

It&#x27;s really a great addition to any developer&#x27;s tool chain, because it lets you revise your local commit history—before you share your work with the rest of the team.
