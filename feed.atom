A typical example could be a web development agency that wants to put multiple customers on a shared platform, or a media house serving multiple brands.
This post aims to be an overview of methods to share code between multiple related Next.js projects.
Let's dive into this topic and talk about the first big decision you have to make - multitenancy or monorepo.

Angular has allowed us to polyfill features back to browsers like IE 9, 10, and 11 for a while using the polyfills.ts file. With the introduction of Angular CLI 7.3 we get conditional polyfills, where we only ship the older polyfills to pre-ES2105 browsers. This results in a savings of about 56Kb. This won’t take you from average to superhero load times, but this is an easy optimization.
If you’re starting a new project, just make sure you have at least @angular/cli@7.3.0 installed globally via npm and ng new away!
If you have an older project there are a few more steps. Here is the outline:
Upgrade global CLI to 7.3
Upgrade project to CLI 7.3
Delete IE polyfills from polyfills.ts

Add flag to angular.json

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Enumerations are an awesome feature of typescript, you can create a set of distinct cases with numeric or string-based enums.
For example, if you're working on a game of cards and figure out you could actully use enum to define the suits:
enum Suit {
  Clubs = '♣️',
  Spades = '♠️',
  Diamonds = '♦️',
  Hearts = '♥️',
}

Now, if you have a collection of objects and each object in the collection has a value represented by an enum, you can actually write a pretty neat function to split it into smaller collections, each limited to a certain enum value. In our case we could split a deck of cards into clubs, spades, diamods and hearts correspondently.
For the sake of simplicity our deck will have only 4 cards, namely 4 aces, one from each suit, here's our small deck:

The key to handling modern dynamic, scalable workloads in Kubernetes is a networking stack that can deliver API management, a service mesh and an ingress controller. Kong Ingress Controller allows users to manage the routing rules that control external user access to the service in a Kubernetes cluster from the same platform.
This article will look at how you can use Kong for full-stack application deployments with Kubernetes. By full-stack, we mean Kong can handle:

The advantages of running containers over using the traditional methods of virtualization are known to all. But where does the data in the running container go. Let's find out!
If we look at the image below-

There is a local machine which has a container running on it's memory, and it wants to access data somewhere on the disk.
There are two ways by which docker allows us to do this-
Persisting state option 1- Blind mounts
Persisting state option 2- Volumes
Let us have a look at both of the methods-

After getting into volumes Click on Create Volume


Make sure you select the current available zone of which your instance is running.Select the additional volume size

Successfully volume created now it is available to attach to any instance

Now select additional volume and click on attach then select Attach Volume

Select the instance that you want to attach and click on attach 

Now volume status will be in-use

Now connect to your instance using ssh and execute following cmd
# sudo fdisk -l

you can see 

Its not enough that attaching a volume doesn't make that additional volume usable.
# sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf

# mkdir myfolder
# sudo mount /dev/xvdf myfolder/


Now it is successfully attached and we can use it for read and write operations

Unmount additional volume
# umount myfolder/

Don't detach additional volume directly from EBS please unmount it in specific instance
you can cross-check again 

Now go to the EBS volumes tab and select additional volume and detach it 

Now the detached volume will be available for use and data created in it will be also persisted and we can also attach it to another running instance 

Note: Please don't use this below cmd if you want data to be persisted while attaching the volume to another instance
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf
If you use the above cmd again means data will be erased 
just use below cmds and mount the additional volume in any instance
# mkdir myfolder
# sudo mount /dev/xvdf myfolder/]]></summary>

TL;DR: Managing secrets and credentials used to secure communication between the different components of a cloud solution can be challenging for developers. This can be simplified with managed identities available in the Microsoft Azure cloud. Let's see how to deal with secrets management in ASP .NET Core applications hosted on the Azure cloud.
Managing secrets in cloud solutions can be a big challenge. Whether it's a database password or a connection string to access a specific service — these values should be stored securely. In the Microsoft Azure cloud, there is a dedicated service called Azure Key Vault. It is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets. When thinking about secrets, we should have in mind that they can be in many different forms. A database password is a secret, a certificate is a secret, and a cryptographic key is also considered a secret.
Storing secrets in places like a configuration file can expose our application to vulnerabilities similar to the ones due to bad programming practices or bugs. Many developers struggle with managing secrets properly and looking for a solution to test the application locally without worrying about secrets management after deployment. This is where Azure Key Vault and Azure managed identities can help.
In this article, we will explore how to set up Azure Key Vault, store the secret in it, and access this secret from the ASP .NET Core application using Azure managed identity. We will learn how to combine using secrets locally and access them after the deploying to the Azure cloud.

Or does your company have requirements to be able to reproduce deployments and trace exactly what dependencies were used at a specific time? Great - continue reading!
Being dependent on open source 📦 npm packages means dependencies to the public npm registry and npm package maintainers = constantly changing environment. This also means that you have the responsibility to keep track of what package versions were used in a specific deployment. This is a crucial task to reduce risks and make sure unintended changes have not been made.
Even without any change to package.json your builds may produce a different set of dependencies at different points in time (semver versioning and addition of new minor versions to public registries).
The slightest change in patch versions means your builds are no longer deterministic where you are guaranteed the exact same results - and deploying dependencies that have not been tested is never a good idea...
💡 For me, the way to go is to freeze your registry when you want to avoid accidental updates. Freezing a registry effectively locks down the state of your package versions and makes the registry read-only so that only intended changes are applied to code you trust.
The video below shows the easiest way to make your registry read-only using the Freeze policy in Bytesafe:




Benefits of using the Freeze policy in Bytesafe:
✅ Guaranteed exact same versions when testing and building your applications
✅ Deterministic and consistent results across all your environments such as Test, UAT and Production
🔗 This blog post also describes how to work with the Freeze policy to achieve consistent tests and builds.
I would love to hear what you think of this solution and how you avoid accidental updates today. I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.]]></summary>

Event-driven architecture is what this style is called, and it's most prevalent in serverless applications. API gateways collect requests from your users, convert them to events, and send these along the way. Sometimes an upstream service, like DynamoDB or SQS, can handle such an event directly to save on Lambda invocation costs.
More often than not, we need to apply some validation and transformation to an event so the service can handle it. That's where Lambda comes into play, and that's also one source of our timeouts.

In this article I would like to talk about an often-used feature on a user-centric application - the scroll-to-top button for allowing a user to quickly scroll to the top of the page, without having to use the mouse. The end result would be something like this:

Let's break up this implementation into 3 steps:
✔️ Set up the scroll-to-top button (with some nice styling).
I have used @angular/material for some easy styling. In order to display the button fixed to the bottom-right corner of the page (and some nice hover effects with opacity), I have used the below properties on the :host -

This is an interesting section. To begin with, we need to set up an Observable on the scroll event of the DOCUMENT. You may directly access the document object, or you may use an InjectionToken<Document>, provided by angular.
This observable starts emitting values as soon as the user starts to scroll up or down. Now we are not really interested in the actual scroll event, but we would like to check something important every time the scroll event is fired - and that is the scroll position. Angular makes this quite simple with the ViewportScroller service from @angular/common package. This service has few useful methods, and I am going to use two of them - getScrollPosition and scrollToPosition.

The getScrollPosition method returns an array of 2 numbers - the X and Y coordinate. I check if the Y coordinate is more than 0 (which means the user has scrolled down) and I enable the scroll-to-top button.
For this last part, I make use of the scrollToPosition method, which again takes in the X and Y coordinates, and I scroll to [0, 0].

Vim is one of the most powerful text editor that exists. It's a program that you can configure to make it do anything. It has a steep learning curve, and can take months or years to master. 
Vim can be used without the mouse, everything using key presses. My first experience with vi was really bad (I forgot everything about it) but once I got used to it and learned a couple of commands and a few ex commands I fell in love with vi.
You could wonder, when writing code why use a mouse at all?
Once you know the vim commands it's very easy to use. It's a great bonus that it can be used in the terminal, because it lets you quickly edit your system files or edit files remotely using ssh.
I was a fairly experienced computer user. I started using a computer around age 12 or so, taught myself basic programming when I was about 13, and eventually became rather adept at various aspects of the art of computing.

I found myself needing to do a lot of system administration, and in the past I would have used nano, but I decided to try vim. I’d heard good things about it in the past but had never really tried it, so I was curious.
Here are some reasons I switched to vi/vim : 
1) It is extremely fast 
Vim is probably installed on your computer, if you open a terminal you can type
$ vim

And to exit press ZQ. If in the rare situation it's not installed, it is available in your package manager. However, even on a commercial OS like Mac OS X vim is available by default.
If you are new to vim, you can practice here]]></summary>

As usual, AWS provides decent documentation. Here is an example about how the Run order of hooks is documented. However, I could not find a table with all three cased combined. So I created one and it did help me a lot during the study. And also, I had a question in the exam about the "AfterAllowTestTraffic" hook.

Note 1: The greyed out hooks in the table are reserved for CodeDeploy operations. They cannot be used to run scripts.
Note 2: Hooks on EC2 can be used to run scripts on instances, while hooks for Lambda and ECS can be used only to run Lambda functions.

In this blog post we will shed light on the server side.
Why do I need to handle i18n in my application's backend?
Think of all user faced content not directly rendered in your browser...
For example you're building a command line interface (CLI)?
You're sending some emails?
Or you're using server side rendering (SSR)?
etc.
We will show some examples that uses i18next as i18n framework. If you're curious to know why we suggest i18next, have a look at this page.

TypeScript provides a powerful system for working with types. There are the basic types you already know from JavaScript. For example, types such as number, string, boolean, object, symbol, null, undefined. This is not all TypeScript offers. On top of these types are also built-in utility types.

The generic syntax of a middleware is
//generic express middleware syntax
const middleware = (req, res, next) => {

  next(); // This is where the control leaves this middleware and moves to next item in the queue, which could be another middleware, or the final controller etc

Conclusion
Okay so attempt #1 didn't quite work, but all the package managers have a feature called Workspaces, which npm describes like this:
[Workspaces] provides support to managing multiple packages from your local files system from within a singular top-level, root package.
That sure sounds relevant, so let's give it a try!



The npm documentation is so terse I've honestly no clue how to get anything working 🤷‍♀️. If you know your way around npm workspaces I'm happy to swap stories, but for now I'm giving up on this.



Documentation here is definitely a step up, with more examples to draw inspiration from. Still a bit hard to grasp though, but I also came across this nice "actual complete guide to typescript monorepos" article by @cryogenicplanet

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using sveltekit and svelte for over a year now. I'm also anxiously waiting for it to be matured enought to beat NextJs in terms of community. But I like them both.
So, on this weekend I wanted to turn one of my projects into a PWA. When I wanted to do with NextJs projects there were a lot of tutorials. But I couldn't find many guides for svelte beginners.
That's because svelte has pwa functionality built into it.
 A website
 manifest.json [ basic icons,names,shortcuts]
 service-worker [ for offline cache ]
So let's get on with it.

We'll create a demo Sveltekit project:
npm init svelte@next my-app


Then we'll choose a simple config in vite for the sake of this article:

Choose typescript because ts >>>> js:

Now we have a demo project setup with typescript, it will be straight-forward from here on:

Let's get into our directory:
cd my-app

And run:
yarn


After that,
In the /static directory, We'll create a manifest.json.
When svelte compiles the whole application the static files will be copied over to the build folder.

Then we'll refer our manifest.json in src/app.html.

And finally we'll create our src/service-worker.ts
Svelte will automatically detect the service-worker in the src folder's root and then register our service worker during build.
Isn't that neat?

Now we just need to build or app using yarn build:

Now we can preview our build using yarn preview:

'0' is that a 'install app' button,

Svelte makes it easy to make PWAs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A simple POC where Angular requests the URL of an image to the Quarkus back end and then renders the image in the screen. Quarkus returns the image in two ways: (1) a simple copy from the URL of the image; (2) the image encoded in Base64 with the Media Type.
The project is available on GitHub poc-http-copy-images.

Let's imagine a hypothetical situation where only the backend have access to the URL of some images and you want to render these images on the frontend.
In this POC, I propose two ways of solving this problem:
The backend access the URL of the image and expose the same Response object;
The backend access the URL of the image, encode it into Base64 and expose it into a JSON object with the Media Type.
Optionally, you can run a Quarkus mock server which will provide three endpoints with the below images:
http://localhost:8090/image/earth.png
http://localhost:8090/image/moon.jpg
http://localhost:8090/image/solarsystem.svg
*** Optionally, because you can choose any image from the internet to run the test.
Enter inside the mock-server folder and type:
$ mvn quarkus:dev -Ddebug=5006

The swagger will be available at:
http://localhost:8090/q/swagger-ui

Enter inside the quarkus folder and type:
$ mvn quarkus:dev -Ddebug=5006

The swagger will be available at:
http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui

Enter inside the angular folder and type:
$ npm install
$ ng serve

The front end will be available at:
http://localhost:4200/
Ok, in this screen, just put the URL of any image you desire (of the mock or the internet) and click on Load Image:

After clicking in the button, the image will be displayed in two columns, the left one is the raw copy from the URL and the right one is the Base64 version:

Any new image searched will be shown and the previous ones will slide down:]]></summary>

The Metasploit framework is a very powerful tool which can be used by cybercriminals as well as ethical hackers to probe systematic vulnerabilities on networks and servers. Because it’s an open-source framework, it can be easily customized and used with most operating systems.
With Metasploit, the pen testing team can use ready-made or custom code and introduce it into a network to probe for weak spots. As another flavour of threat hunting, once flaws are identified and documented, the information can be used to address systemic weaknesses and prioritize solutions.

  How do reverse shells work?


To make a connection to a typical remote shell, a machine controlled by the attacker connects to the remote network host and it requests a shell connection.

But what if the remote host is not directly accessible, like it has public IP or is protected by a firewall?
In this situation reverse shells maybe shouldn't be used, where the target machine initiates connection to the listening network host a shell is now established.
To start you need a listener process on their system to listen the reverse shell connections incoming to their IP address, Eg, 12.12.12.12
nc -lvnp 7070

The netcat listener will listen at port 7070. An attacker needs to execute the code to the listener. Many reverse shells needs programming langs

Python has a great feature where it first compiles your source code into bytecode; this is a low-level platform-independent representation of your source code.

*ngIf and *ngFor will remove elements from the DOM. There isn’t a CSS solution for animating a non-existing element in the DOM. But Angular provides us with a simple solution.
For purposes of brevity, wherever I refer to *ngIf it is equally applicable to *ngFor. The complete, working code can be downloaded here.
Let’s start with the default application generated by the CLI and just modify the nice Angular logo in and out of the view based on a button we add.

You won’t need routing and can select SCSS for the styling.
Let’s add the button we want to use to toggle our *ngIf on the image. Open app.component.html and add a simple button: (this is the default HTML)

PATs are easy to create when you need them and easy to revoke when you don’t.

When creating a new PAT you can select the organization where you want to use the token, and then choose a lifespan for your token. Say for example making it only active and usable for a period of 30 days. A PATs lifetime can be extended if needed, but cannot be longer than the maximum period of 1 year.

Aggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<replace_with_channel_id>
Videos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed
Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
Works on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.
Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
Changed: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention
Changed: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)
Thank you @PiyushLosalka]]></summary>
