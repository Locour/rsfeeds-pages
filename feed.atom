Here's what you can accomplish by building notifications:
Drive engagement. Notifications inform customers that there’s something going on in your application that’s worthy of their attention. Timely notifying your audience about valuable content or interactions with other users is great for building trust and engagement.
Enable user journeys based on asynchronous actions. If you don’t expect your users to always be connected to your app or service, notifications enable your users to stay plugged in without having to constantly check for updates in-app.

Here's an example:




function add(x) {
return function(y) {
  return function(z) {
    return x + y + z;
  }
}

}
console.log(add(10)(20)(30));

The add(10)(20)(30) should return 60.
This is useful in your program if you can't supply all the arguments to a function at one time. You can save each function call into a variable, that hold's the returned function that takes the next argument when it's available.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this tutorial, I explain one workaround that I did to create one Docker image of one Angular application which has one dynamic API URL.
The article How To Build An Angular App Once And Deploy It To Multiple Environments - Solution 4: Override environment file values explains how you can do this.
But, as I'm far from a Docker expert, I spent some time to create the Dockerfile to do this :)
Just quoting the article:
The idea is to use Angular’s environment.ts (for local development) and environment.prod.ts (for all other stages) with placeholder values which are overwritten per deployment:
export const environment = {
  apiUrl: 'MY_APP_API_URL',
  stage: 'MY_APP_STAGE',
};

If our pod is started we can then run the following script, for example in a Dockerfile, that overrides these placeholder values:
#!/bin/sh
# replace placeholder value in JS bundle with environment specific values
sed -i "s#MY_APP_API_URL#$API_URL#g" /usr/share/nginx/html/main.*.js

Here is the Dockerfile I created to run this workaround:
FROM nginx:latest

COPY dist/your-app-name /usr/share/nginx/html

CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", \
"echo API_URL=[$API_URL], && \
sed -i s#MY_APP_API_URL#$API_URL#g /usr/share/nginx/html/main.*.js && \
nginx -g 'daemon off;'"]

Build your project:
$ ng build

Place this Dockerfile into your Angular root folder and run this to build your image:
$ docker build -t angular/your-app-name .

After this, just run your container passing the API_URL variable:
$ docker run -p 80:80 --name your-app-name -e API_URL=http://localhost:8080 angular/your-app-name]]></summary>

It’s all a black box, breaks with vague error messages, that ultimately lead you down a tunnel of “google and pray”. Unless you’ve spent a lot of time with Webpack, it’s hard to troubleshoot when it inevitably breaks. (and seriously, who freaking has time to learn all the idiosyncrasies of Webpack?)
But even with that, the benefits vastly outpace the drawbacks. When Javascript build tools work, they work beautifully – compiling your scripts down to the smallest size, ensuring that it works on all web browsers, and in the case of WordPress, even automatically enqueuing dependent scripts that are a part of WordPress core.

First problematic, how do we manage an input value in <input> ?
We could do the next :
<script>
export default {
  name: "HelloWorld",
  data: function () {
    return {
      message: '',
    }
  },
  methods: {
     updateMessage(event) {
         this.message = event.target.value
     }
  },
};
</script>

<template>
<div>
    <input
        :value="message"
        @input="updateMessage"
        >
</div>
</template>

We need to bind value of input to our current data message and handle event from this input in order to update our current data message.
It's not really friendly and we have to do this for every  component...
You can use the v-model directive to create two-way data bindings on form input, textarea, and select elements. It automatically picks the correct way to update the element based on the input type.
So we can replace the code above by
<script>
export default {
  name: "HelloWorld",
  data: function () {
    return {
      message: '',
    }
  },
};
</script>

<template>
<div>
    <input v-model="message">
</div>
</template>

We can remove the method that update value ! Since v-model will directly update it.
It's very useful !]]></summary>

When you have to log, do it consistently.
Logging is necessary. It allows us to debug in both development and production. But console is disallowed by tslint by default. And for good reason. Console logging is a mess most of the time. If you can just willy-nilly console.log(whatever) then your logs are pretty much useless.
We can end up with too much logging in production, which can slow our application down, and not enough in development where we need more details.
I’ve had to deal with this issue on multiple projects and have written a static logger class in Angular that allows us to control what we log and where.
Here is the gist https://gist.github.com/jkyoutsey/e99336d58c2c83bc0ba03cde78fcc64e

Smartphone and tablet use was rising, and the recent completion of the HTML5 specification, together with nice additions such as the web manifest, seemed to pave a path to a bright future. As the hip social network Facebook bet strongly on HTML5 for their mobile application, everything was shipshape.
Then there were some unfortunate setbacks. First, the up-and-coming native app framework PhoneGap did not go anywhere. Facebook then announced they were rewriting their mobile app. HTML5 was not ready yet, they said.
Finally, as Google announced AMP — a subset of HTML5 with some custom elements — no one wanted to bet on HTML as an app platform. Failed experiments such as webOS and Mozilla’s Firefox OS set the transition back ev…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After you've upgraded to Angular v12 from a previous version of Angular, you may notice your ng serve times have increased, along with missing sourcemaps, and longer rebuild times during development. This post helps you set a default configuration to development to get your application serving the same as previously.
In Angular version 12, running ng build now defaults to production mode. This is a welcomed change, as there is less chance of accidentally deploying a development build to production, which is a lot slower and bigger, giving the perception that Angular is slow. This also aligns with other web frameworks that build for production out of the box.
The way Angular serves the application, it essentially does a build with watch mode. As mentioned before, doing a build is now done by default with production optimizations enabled. This adds more time to the build process.
There is a migration to add a "development" build configuration.
To run this migration, run:
ng update @angular/cli --migrate-only production-by-default

One caveat is that it only supports migrating first-party Angular builders for development mode, including:
@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server
@angular-devkit/build-angular:protractor
To fix this manually, you add the development options as defaults, and a defaultConfiguration set to an empty string so it doesn't default to production.
Now, when running ng serve you will get a development build, which is faster for local development.

Here's some of our best tutorials for JavaScript forEach():
1) Iterating Through an Object with forEach()
JavaScript arrays have a forEach() function, but general objects do not. This tutorial explains 3 ways to iterate through an object using forEach(): using Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries().
2) How to Break Out of a JavaScript forEach() Loop
You can't use the break statement with forEach(), because forEach() is a function, not a loop. If you want to break out of a forEach() loop, the easiest way is to use .every() instead of .forEach(). This tutorial presents 3 ways to simulate break in a forEach().
3) Get The Current Array Index in JavaScript forEach()
The forEach() function calls your callback with 3 parameters. Most forEach() loops only use the first parameter, the value. The 2nd parameter is the current array index. This tutorial shows you how to get the array index.
4) Using Continue in JavaScript forEach()
Because forEach() is a function, not a loop, you can't use continue. However, with forEach(), return behaves like continue. This tutorial presents 2 alternatives for simulating continue with forEach().
5) How to Use forEach in an Async Function
The forEach() function doesn't work well with async await. This is one of the major reasons why we recommend for/of over forEach(). This tutorial presents 2 alternative patterns that simulate async forEach().]]></summary>

Static apps make sense for the fixed parts of your site, but Jamstack apps are capable of incorporating dynamic, interactive components as well.
In this hands-on tutorial, we’ll explore step-by-step how to add a SpreadJS spreadsheet to a Jamstack app created with Next.js. The Next.js React framework provides server-side pre-rendering out-of-the-box.

One thing that required “a bit” of attention was the build process for different platforms (Windows, macOS) and part of it was the app notarization step on macOS.

If you are using Pantavisor Linux with our PVBox frontend you can simply use the pvboxctl "install" command to get this done:

Next you select "Add from docker"

And choose a name:

And finally type the "Docker Source" ref from your preferred docker registry:

And let pvr do the the rest:

Once finished you will have a chance to do some final edits to you app and commit it:
===============================
Pantabox Interactive Edit Shell
===============================

We have provisioned the following files
for the parts you have selected to edit:


You can now edit part \'mynewapp\' and change
them to your liking.

Remember to pvr commit any changes you might
want to apply to your system.

When done, you can:
1. apply committed changes: exit 0 (or Ctrl-D)
2. discard your changes: exit 1

For help visit: https://pantavisor.io

pvctlbox::mynewapp#


Often you can just use the container using the default configuration pantavisor linux generated for you.
Once happy you would run:
pvr add .
pvr commit

and exit the interactive shell (e.g. press ctrl-D) to apply you changes and instruct pantavisor to run the new, modified system that includes your new docker container.]]></summary>

The need for Docker arises from virtual machines on servers being used at large scales. Take a large business for example. For a business that uses hundreds of servers with a cluster of virtual machines for each of their platforms, maintaining these machines is a full-time job. Each server has to have an OS installed, it needs upgrades and patches from time to time, and then dependencies for the applications each machine uses also have to be installed.

RAID 0 disk arrays are known for relatively high data access time, and that’s why people choose to use them primarily because of the considerable boost in the speed of read and write operations. However, their reliability and fault-tolerance leave much to be desired. Even if one of the drives is out of order, all the data in such a disk array is going to be lost. Recovering the information from this array type is quite a challenge, but even then, all the data you may be able to extract will certainly be damaged. In fact, this type is not much of a disk array because it offers no redundancy at al…]]></summary>

In this example project B and C depends on project A, and project D depends on projects B and C. Therefore, project A must be executed first, then projects B and C, and finally project D. Resulting in this order: [A, B, C, D] or [A, C, B, D].
Note that we start from node A because it doesn't have dependencies and repeat it, that is after A is done, B and C haven't dependencies anymore, so we can choose either one to be the next. That's why this algorithm works only on acyclic graphs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[💫 The "magic glue" that connects the view and the model, keeping them both in sync.
Angular Change Detection is one of the most complex topics in software engineering and obviously in Angular as it is relying on that a lot. It can definitely be compared to the "magic glue" that connects the view and the model, keeping them both in sync".
On a broader scale, it is a mechanism built into Angular that allows Angular to decide what actions can be performed when the state of the app changes. The good news is that most of the time, developers do not have to deal with change detection manually.
However, if you find yourself caught in a loop, the only way to simplify your journey is to follow specific strategies, for example OnPush and trigger change detection manually if you need to. 
There are four ways you can trigger change detection manually. Let’s look at them in detail:
tick() on ApplicationRef **that activates change detection for the entire application by staying consistent and respectful to the strategy component of the change detection.
detectChanges() on ChangeDetectorRef  runs change detection on a current component.
markForCheck() on ChangeDetectorRef controls change detection through the marked components where the OnPush strategy has been set.
run() on NgZone that allows you to execute a function inside the Angular zone. This function, and all asynchronous operations in that function, trigger change detection automatically at the correct time.
Here is a very handy tip, which can simplify your life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am an angular collaborator and an avid user of Angular this is my first react project a netflix clone using react, styled components, jest tests. It uses firebase firestore as the DB if you want to run it you have to set it up using the seed data already given. To setup follow the instruction in readme and firebase.prod.js. You can also fork my repo or set it upto learn more.
Creating a component in React.js is a dream components cannot be created easier than this.


Hooks for state management - Hooks are a really easy paradigm for state management 




  
  
  Neutral experiences



Styled components - Suffers from scalability problems writing styles again and again seemed weird but the scoping was great.
Context was weird Calling use context again and again seemed odd somehow. Maybe I'm not accustomed to it.


How to find right tools for the job you are trying to do. React has so many options which is great but it makes choosing the right tool that much harder.


How to scale react could not find good resources on it. 




  
  
  Angular apparent short comings after using React




State Management- It has nothing compared to hooks


Component creation is so hard in Angular


Why do we need modules. Why?


Angular team giving every package has taken its toll on angular innovation. Not much is tried by the community in angular.




  
  
  Angular strong suit




Angular basics will always be same because of the same lib use so easy to work on multiple projects


Angular directives there is nothing like them 


Angular schematics setting up libs for you is great


Angular Cli is the best




  
  
  CSS Management


I don't know how we got to this place in frontend but there is no great way in Angular or react to manage your CSS is important in frontend but not much attention or tooling is there for managing it
Let me know in the comments if I'm wrong about something or I need to study more I'm trying to learn other frameworks so that I know more paradigms in frontend development.]]></summary>

I am currently a Masters's candidate studying computer science at Colorado State University. After I completed my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Philosophy, I was employed as a cybersecurity intern by the academic computing and networking services at CSU. I quickly developed a deep passion for cybersecurity and computer science and decide to go back to school to learn more.
While studying for my master's, I have been employed as a Junior Systems Administrator for the Computer Science department, managing over 600 Unix machines. This summer I am also working for Hedera Hashgraph as a developer advocate intern providing educational content on how to leverage the Hashgraph distributed network.

This results in a real VM that can boot instantly, while using very limited resources. If done properly, slim can allow you to design and build immutable unikernels for running services, or build tiny and embedded development environments.
Slim currently supports Virtualbox, KVM, and hyperkit (MacOS only) as providers for running VMs. Slim will discover all available providers, defaulting to virtualbox, if more than one provider is available. The -p flag can be used to force Slim to use a specific provider.
You can find repo here

        slim
      
    
 

slim will build a micro-vm from a Dockerfile. Slim works by building and extracting a rootfs from a Dockerfile, and then merging that filesystem with a small minimal kernel that runs in RAM.
This results in a real VM that can boot instantly, while using very limited resources. If done properly, slim can allow you to design and build immutable unikernels for running services, or build tiny and embedded development environments.
Create a micro-vm from a Dockerfile. Use build command with a directory containing a Dockerfile.
$ slim build images/alpine3.8-simple



This will add a bootable iso in the slim registry. See example Dockerfile.
slim build will use your default provider unless the -p flag is specified (ie -p hyperkit).

Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
