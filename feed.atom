        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there.
At first, let's talk about what is node.js.
These are just a few companies that use Node.js. There are many more, for the same or different reasons.
Uber, a cab dispatch service, also uses Node.js for their core system. 
Node.js was chosen because the Uber service is used all over the world and requires a huge network system to operate.
Paypal is a payment service that uses email accounts and the Internet.
By switching from Java to Node.js as the server-side development language, the gap with the front-side development has been reduced.
LinkedIn is the social network for professional connections. It is best suited for people looking to make serious career moves who want to get noticed by relevant companies. 
Previously, Ruby on Rails was used, but in order to increase the speed of access, it was moved to Node.js.
Netflix is the world’s biggest global provider of video streaming including movies and television series, available in over 190 countries. As of July 2020, Netflix reported over 192 million subscribers worldwide, with more than 72 million in the U.S itself.
Previously, Netflix was using Java on the back end and JavaScript on the front end, which required the developers to be proficient with languages.
Now, The user interface (UI) of Netflix was built using Node.js.
Next, his is an explanation of the Node.js package management tool "npm".
npm is automatically installed when Node.js is installed.
There are two ways to install packages with npm "global installation" and "local installation".
npm allows to create a file called "package.json".
These are useful command of npm.
npm install npm 
npm i npm 

npm install [package name] 
npm i [package name] 

npm uninstall [package name] 
npm rm [package name] 

npm update [package name] 
npm up [package name] 

npm list 
npm ls 

npm init

Today, I explained about basic Node.js.
I hope this article helps you understand node.js!
Happy coding! :)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Selecting data from an Ngrx store has always been achieved by using selectors. As Ngrx has developed over the last couple of years, selectors have become easier and easier to use.
interface Customer { id: number; name: string; }
interface AppState { customers: Customer[] }

export const selectCustomers = (state: AppState) => state.customers;

The above selectCustomers selector conveniently returns Customers from the store.
To do this is nice and simple in Ngrx 12+; we can use a factory selector.
interface Customer { id: number; name: string; }
interface AppState { customers: Customer[] }

export const selectCustomers = (state: AppState) => state.customers;

// selector with param
export const selectCustomerById = (customerId: number) =>
  createSelector(
    selectCustomers, 
    (customers: Customers[]) => 
      customers.find(c => c.id === customerId) 
  )

We can then get a customer with the id of 123 from the store; by passing a value for the customerId into our selector:
this.store.select(selectCustomerById(123));

Hope this helps you all out as the older method of using props is now deprecated in Ngrx 12+. (https://github.com/ngrx/platform/issues/2980)
I also have a YouTube channel called Coffee Music & Coding which you may find useful for Angular and Ngrx tutorials.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://dev.to/bgord/configure-nginx-for-gatsby-404-error-page-5ecf"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Gatsby page development, when you hit a page that doesn't exist, you encounter a screen similar to the one below.

If you created a custom 404 page, for example in src/pages/404.js, you can click the Preview custom 404 page to display it. Entering the /404 route will do the job as well.
In production, however, the 404 page doesn't get handled by itself unless you use a dedicated hosting service for Gatsby pages. That's because Gatsby's development server is no longer present. The production bundle is just a bunch of static files. Making use of a web server (like nginx) to serve the production page forces you to configure the error pages yourself.
Disclaimer: the following nginx configuration is pretty basic, don't use it in production.
Let's assume your blog is hosted on the personalblog.com domain and is served from the /var/www/blog directory on port 80.
server {
        listen 80;
        root /var/www/blog;
        server_name personalblog.com www.personalblog.com;
        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}

After entering a route that doesn't exist in your production Gatsby site, nginx displays its default 404 error page.

Adding the error_page 404 /404; line makes nginx redirect to the /404 route in case of a 404 error. Your custom Gatsby 404 page will be displayed.
server {
        listen 80;
        root /var/www/blog;
        server_name personalblog.com www.personalblog.com;
        error_page 404 /404;
        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}

Previously, with enough time and digging around in Sentry, you (and us) would eventually find these answers — but it wasn’t straightforward. That’s frustrating, especially when time is of the essence.

✨ Bonus: What is hoisting?
Quick answer:
var is a legacy one, let and const are new ones, where let is for mutable variable reference and const is for immutable reference.
Hoisting is when you use variable before you define it.
Longer answer:
var. Syntax is kind of straightforward.
var x = 1, y = 2;
console.log(x, y) // 1, 2

As you may guessed, it is legacy for some reason. And you were right, there are even a few reasons.
For example, var declaration happens before any code execution, so you can basically use variable in code and declare it later.
x = 2
var y = x + 1
console.log(y) // 3
var x;

It is totally weird and tricky from my point of view, because only variable definition comes before the execution, but not initialization.
var y = x + 1
console.log(x) // undefined

A DB-API: 
A DB-API provides a standard for one programming language (like python) to talk to a relational database server.


Is a low-level library for writing SQL statements that connect to a database. 


Also known as database adapters.


Different DBAPIs exist for every server framework or language + database system.


Database adapters define a standard for using a database (with SQL) and using the results of database queries as input data in the given language.



-- Turn a selected (SELECT * from some_table;) list of rows into an array of objects in JavaScript for say a NodeJS adapter; or a list of tuples in Python for a Python adapter.
Examples across languages and server frameworks:
For Ruby (e.g. for Sinatra, Ruby on Rails): pg.


For NodeJS: node-Postgres.

Understanding how our applications function in the wild is essential for developers when issues arise. With the power of knowledge, we can enable ourselves to provide the best experience to our fellow developers, and our stakeholders.
One of the solutions that supplies this power is Application Insights. Application Insights is a service provided by Microsoft allowing you to monitor your application live, detect performance anomalies, and observe this data with powerful analytics.
Together we will see how easy it is to add Application Insights to our applications, whether we have access to the code-base or not. Once instrumented, we will dive deeper into the capabilities of Application Insights and show how to leverage all the rich data collected from our application. Finally, as developers the last thing we want to do is troubleshoot an issue in Production, with everyone watching and the stakes are high.
Watch as we monitor a live application that is throwing exceptions and how Application Insights can be used to help us solve the problem faster. When we are done, attendees will be empowered with the knowledge to leverage Application Insights to be more productive with their work.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MERN Stack happens to be amongst the well-known JavaScript stacks intended for enhancing the web app development process. It is a combo of 4 components: MongoDB, ReactJS, Expressjs, and Nodejs.
Below we will take a close look at each of these components in brief.
MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is document-oriented. As compared to the relational database, it will not come across any column or table. It stores information with an extremely flexible document by making use of JSON-based query language. The time and the productivity needed for fetching the formation are much better than the RDBMS (Relational Database Management System).
ExpressJS
Being a framework for Node JS, Express JS is used for developing API and web apps with minimalized structure and outstanding speed. It removes the burden of writing the identical code again and again for the server, unlike the Node JS HTTP module.
React JS
This one happens to be a JavaScript library that Facebook has developed for creating UI of the webpages. Being declarative React views help to make the process of interface development much productive. It will be possible to run the same code on the server and the browser simultaneously by using React.
Node JS
Node JS is open-sourced by Google and is created on Google Chrome. It is built on the JavaScript engine of Chrome. It has been designed for creating network applications that are scalable and also executing JavaScript code outside a browser. Node JS works excellently when enclosed with an HTML page rather than making use of its module.

Until recently(if you think that 2009 is recently), we could only run JS code in a web browser. Node is a JavaScript runtime that executes code outside of the browser. We can use the same JS syntax we know and love to write server-side code, instead of relying on other languages like Python or Ruby. You can build Web Servers, Command Line Tools, Native Apps(VSCode is a Node app!), Video Games, Drone Software, and a whole lot more.
In this post, I am going to show you how to write your first little Node script which will make you a directory with an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file in it.
First, you need to check if you have Node installed on your machine. If you don't know if you have it, just go to the terminal and write:

I have demonstrated some data manipulations with ORM(Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks such as TypeORM so far. Today's topic is still cases with TypeORM. However, it focuses on the security, which is my main field at the moment. I think you understand why I select topics regarding complex queries, performance, and the difference from the Microsoft ecosystem.
I developed a demo application in GitHub .
Demo Application for SQL injection tutorials
Some experienced developers mention that ORM(Object-Relational Mapping) frameworks such as TypeORM support prevent SQL injection, which is a traditional security matter. However, I still find high-risk cases with ORM frameworks in GitHub repositories, public project spaces, or in my work experience.
This is a typical high-risk cas…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JavaScript. By far one of the most famous programming languages for its applications in scripting, gamedev and most notably web apps 🌐. Then its brother, TypeScript. Famous for being statically typed. It adds more features to JavaScript. Which one is better? 🤔 I guess today we find out.
What follows is going to be my opinion inferred from fact. This may or may not be true. Please read this article accordingly.
JavaScript has many features, scripting, web apps and is even supported in some game engines. To sum it up nicely:
✔  Dynamically typed (beginners don't mix up typing)
❌ No optional parameters
❌ No interfaces
✔  Some game engine support
✔  Compiled not transpiled
❌ No TS file imports
TypeScript has similar syntax to JavaScript but with a few features added.
❌ Statically typed
✔  Optional parameters
✔  Interfaces
❌ Transpiled
✔  Both TS and JS imports
✔  Most JS frameworks support TS
Based on all of this, and my experience using both languages. I would say that TypeScript is better than JavaScript. You may disagree however. If you do, please comment 💬! I would love to hear your opinions!]]></summary>

item,price
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

The goal is to create a one-line bash script that prints the sum of the prices in the file above, which is 7.77.
Step: 1. Print the file content
$ cat shopping.csv

This command prints the file content without modifications.
Output:
item,price
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

Step: 2. Cut the first line
There are many ways to achieve it, but we use the tail +n syntax.
In our case, it takes all the lines until the end of the file, starting from the second line.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2

Output:
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

Step: 3. Cut the first column
awk splits each line by a separator defined by the option -F.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , '{print $2}'

Output:
2.49
1.49
3.79

Step: 4. Concatenate the prices
xargs is used to "squash" the lines into a single string, separating them by space.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , '{print $2}' | xargs

Output:
2.49 1.49 3.79

Step: 5. Replace spaces with pluses
The sed expression replaces the escaped space with + in the entire string (globally - g).
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , '{print $2}' | xargs | sed -e 's/\ /+/g'

Output:
2.49+1.49+3.79

Step: 6. Perform the calculation
bc is a simple calculator that you can use interactively or by piping an equation into it.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , '{print $2}' | xargs | sed -e 's/\ /+/g' | bc

Output:
7.77]]></summary>

This approach, however, has some pitfalls and is error prone. What if you don't set that process.env port? You'll probably have a default value (maybe 3000?), but you will need to run your application to discover such type of thing.
That same problem has been solved by typescript for almost anything. When you have the help of static typing, you can discover some errors a lot faster. That said, how can you use Typescript to have a type-safe way to access configurations?
Take a look at that short snippet:
export class EnvironmentService<Environment> {

  public constructor(
   private readonly variables: Environment
  ) {
    // some logic to assign process.env to this.variables
    // you can use, for instance, 
    this.variables = Joi.attempt<Environment>(process.env))
  }

  public get<T>(name: keyof Environment) {
    return <T><unknown>this.variables[name];
  }
}

In a nutshell,
First, you need to define an interface for you environment;
Then, you do pass it as a type parameter to the EnvironmentService class when instantiating a new object;
Finally, use something like class-validator, Joi or you library of choice to assert if the process.env object has all required variables and assign its value to the variables attribute;
After those simple steps, you can use the method get to fetch all possible environment variables with the help of typescript to guide your choice - and if you need, you can cast the value to some desired type:

That's all folks! If you liked that simple content, don't forget to comment and share with someone you might help. Also, that's my first attempt to write something in english: if you see something wrong, just message me on Twitter (@dotmendes

At some point you will probably need to store a user's auth token on the device, so they won't need to auth whenever they use your app. This is a solved problem on Android with EncryptedSharedPreferences and iOS with the Keychain Services API. But if you're creating a mobile app using Kotlin Multiplatform, the KMP solution might not be as clear. Today we'll go over how to store encrypted key-value data with KMP without having to reinvent the wheel.
Multiplatform Settings is a solid multiplatform key-value store, created by Touchlab's own Russell Wolf, used extensively at Touchlab, as well as in Jetbrains' KMM Production Sample.

Simply put, WebSockets allow push messages, or "live data", to be sent from the server to the client (browser). Usually with HTTP, the client makes a request to the server, specifying that they would like some data please, the server responds with that data or an error and then the connection closes.
Since the client is the one opening the connections and initiating the requests, that leaves no room for the server to push data to the client when the server knows that an update is available.
That's where WebSockets kick in.

For this article I’m going to assume you already understand the basics of Angular routing and components. I won’t bore you with building an entire application. We’ll get right to adding animations so you can see immediate results!
The finished code for this example can be found here.
In your app.module.ts add BrowserAnimationsModule to the module imports.
...
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';
@NgModule({

For unit testing, import NoopAnimationsModule instead. This fulfills the contracts while isolating unit tests from having to deal with the transitions.

It binds the data from our component to the DOM, unidirectional from component to view or view to the component in few ways.
The interpolation is used with {{myproperty}} in the DOM.
<p>{{myproperty}}</p>

Add brackets around of property []like hidden angular bind the property for DOM elements or components.
<p [hidden]="myproperty"></p>
<app-username [name]="myproperty"></app-username>

Angular understand bind events using parentheses like (click) for DOM element or (userSelected) components event trigger.
<button (click)="close()">Close window</button>
<app-logout (logout)="hideDashboard()"><app-/logout>

Angular two-way data binding is bi-directionally communication, using the directive (ngModel) with combination of square brackets and parentheses of the event binding.
The ngModel is part of FormsModule from @angular/forms, it needs to be import in your app.module.ts
import { FormsModule } from "@angular/forms";
 @NgModule({ 
   imports: [BrowserModule, FormsModule], 
   declarations: [ AppComponent],

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an old HP 4050N. For a variety of reasons, I want to have it behind a print server instead of having our laptops print directly to it. Here's how I set that up.
A Raspberry Pi (or honestly any Linux box) running docker. I like the Raspberry Pi and Odroid HC2 for this sort of thing because they have very low power consumption.
A printer that is supported by CUPS




  
  
  Setup


There are several docker images out there you can use, I made one (the source is on github at unixorn/docker-cupsd) because I wanted one that was multi-architecture - mine has AMD64, ARM7 and ARM64 all baked into the same image so you don't have to change the image label based on what system you're running it on. It works fine on Raspberry Pi, Odroids and Intel servers.
The unixorn/cupsd image is a bit on the large side because I crammed a lot of printer drivers into it, you may want to look for docker images that only support single printer families.
We're going to store printers.conf in a directory outside the container so that we don't lose our printer configuration every time we upgrade our container.
I run the cupsd server on an Odroid HC2 because I have /var/lib/docker on the 2TB drive attached to it. I could have put it on one of the Raspberry Pis in my cluster, but didn't want it spooling print jobs and causing excessive wear on a rPi's microSD card.
Make a directory to store your printer configuration. We'll use /docker/cupsd/etc

export CUPSD_DIR='/docker/cupsd/etc'
touch $CUPSD_DIR/printers.conf
Run the cupsd server with




sudo docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 631:631 \
  --privileged \
  -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
  -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
  -v "$CUPSD_DIR/printers.conf:/etc/cups/printers.conf" \
  unixorn/cupsd

You can now connect to http://SERVER:631 and add printers using the web UI.
When adding the printers to your Mac, select Internet Printing Protocol and put in the IP or DNS name of your print server machine.
The queues are printers/printername, not printername.]]></summary>

That's a hassle though, because inevitably we forget to shut it off sometimes and it stays on overnight or even for days, and while it has a powersave mode, the 4050N is so old that even that burns a good amount of power.
Enter Home Assistant.
The watcher script and associated tooling all presume that we can send messages to a MQTT topic that HA is watching.
Your computers should be configured to print to the cupsd server instead of directly to the printer.
I run cupsd in a container on one of my Odroids. I could run it on the same Odroid HC2 that I run Home Assistant (HA) on, but there's no compelling reason to do so and I'm reserving th…]]></summary>

However, when you are outside, using public Wi-Fi will give you a nightmare if you aren't aware of the risk of security issues. So, if you are considering whether to connect to the public Wi-Fi network at the shopping mall, the airport, etc. beware of the potential risk to your device because hackers love public Wi-Fi!
The most effective trick to staying safe on public Wi-Fi is to use a VPN on your devices. Although virtual private networks are not infallible, they can protect your privacy. They encrypt data that passes through the network and connect your device to a secure server, making it harder for the hackers on the same network or anyone who controls the…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These days whenever we post a URL (Uniform Resource Locator / Link) on any social media site, it will be converted to a short URL with that specific site's domain in it.
This is ok, because the shortened URL will reduce the number of characters in the post and also when you look at a post with a long URL (more than 25 characters in it), it will no look good.
But, we often receive messages over WhatsApp or other social media websites, sometimes even as SMS on our phone with short URLs in them, asking us to visit that URL to claim a gift or something else.
The main problem here will be that most of these short URLs will be created by using services which are free and you really cannot tell where you will be redirected by clicking on it.
There are a few websites and services which will tell you what is behind a short URL and where you will be redirected once you click on it.
One such service is ExpandURL - Link
First go to ExpandURL and there you will see a page like this,

Paste the short URL (which u received as a message) in the input text field and click on Expand URL
The service will check the short URL and will give you results of it. The results will be shown like this,

Results will include,
the number of redirects made from the short URL to the expanded URL (long URL)
Available Meta description, and keywords
Content-Type 
Whether the link appears to be safe or not (Google Safe Browsing)
This is only a way to check where the user will be redirected after clicking on the short URL and whether the URL is appearing to be safe or not.
After confirming that the URL is safe and clicking on it, you should also check the content on that website.
Sometimes, the URLs (long URL) of the phishing websites will also appear to be safe, ultimately it is us who should decide whether you can stay on that site or should leave immediately.]]></summary>

Think of a disposable, long password and write it down in Notepad or other text editor
Use it as your new root password
Create a primary user account and use the same password for the account password.
Finish and exit the the setup utilities
Now, you should be able to enter commands using the user "root". Use the following commands to change the password for "root" and your newly created user




passwd root
(Follow on screen instruction to type in your less secure password)

passwd your_newly_created_user
(Follow on screen instruction to type in your less secure password again)


There might be some debate on why you would want your password simple instead of using a complex one to improve security. 
In my case, I am setting up an environment on ZeroPi that try to match the Raspberry Pi OS in which it is easier for students to get started with Raspberry Pi's teaching materials (And one of them is the default user "pi" with password "raspberry"). But in general if you are using this system yourself, I would recommend a more complex and secure password for root instead.]]></summary>

A fuzzer now-days is a automated testing tool to find security bugs. It does so by generating many inputs to be executed until on of them crashes the target program. In other words the objective is to crash a program, but how can we guide the fuzzer in the right direction? 
AFL added to the objective a notion of code coverage: Any input that reaches an area in the code that was unreachable before is interesting. Even if it did not crash the program we can mutate that input to get even more coverage, we call this feedback. Over the past years coverage had proved to be a great feedback mechanism, but collecting it was not simple if one did not own the source code of the target binary.

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
