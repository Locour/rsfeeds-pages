Storage, speed, and a comfortable keyboard are more vital than clock speeds, cores, and threads. Playing around with code and programming software is a necessity for many professions, and even for many hobbies. Of course, if it‚Äôs something that you‚Äôve ever tried before, you will know that having a high quality computer is important for getting tasks done to the highest standards. If you‚Äôre still relatively new to programming or you haven‚Äôt bought a new laptop in a while, you may not know what sorts of specifications you should be looking out for.

Imagine o seguinte cen√°rio: Voc√™ possui um playbook que realiza modifica√ß√µes no seu invent√°rio como adicionar um novo host, e durante a mesma execu√ß√£o do playbook precisa que este host rec√©m-adicionado seja levado em considera√ß√£o para uma pr√≥xima task ou role.
Para melhor ilustrar, criei abaixo um arquivo de invent√°rio e um playbook que simplesmente ir√° imprimir todos os hosts do invent√°rio, adicionar um novo host chamado host-03 e depois imprimir novamente os hosts:

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer




This article assumes you have some familiarity with the React framework, and Javascript and Typescript fundamentals. It also assumes you are comfortable with concepts and terms related to relational databases.



What led me to consider Mirage
(1) Don't put everything in one file

(2) Start with a plan

(3) Define Typescript interfaces for models

(4) Consider a "hybrid" approach for generating realistic seed data

(5) Split up and aggregate route handlers

(6) Create API client functions for UI components

(7) Set up passthroughs and a unique namespace for mock routes

The reason you want to have tests are many:
Correctness. Ensure your code works as as intended for certain scenarios.
Confidence. When you have a lot of tests covering your code it creates a level of confidence. With this confidence you start daring to change this, if you for example would need to refactor code and ensure it still works after those changes.
Architecture. Another reason for having tests is that it drives architecture. If you create tests around what you do, you ensure you build your code in a way that makes it testable. That, drives the architecture.
There are many other reasons for wanting to have tests but the three above are quite compelling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're into Typescript and prefer a code-first approach when working with databases, you'll be happy to learn about Prisma! Prisma is a next-generation Node.js and TypeScript ORM, that allows you to define a schema using a dedicated DSL so that you can then have all the comforts of modern development environments like intellisense, static type checking, automatic scaffolding and more.
To help everyone, even those who just started working as coders - or those who want to start a career as software engineers - we have created a fully working end-to-end full-stack solution that has:
a frontend written with Vue.Js

a backend, written in Typescript and using Prisma

an Azure SQL database (for the reasons explained here)
to make it consumable by really everyone, we also decided to support both REST and GraphQL protocols and we also decided to make sure that everyone can take advantage of a streamlined CI/CD experience, so we used Azure Static Web Apps and GitHub Actions to glue everything together.
Last, but not least, the sample also support Authentication and Authorization (which is super simple thanks to Azure Static Web Apps!)
I must say I'm happy and proud of what has been done, as this example is a great learning experience and starting point for everyone interested in becoming a better developer.
So, look at the article here to learn more about Prisma:
Modern application development with Prisma, GraphQL (or REST) and Azure SQL
and to the repository hear to deploy the code on your own:
 / 
        azure-sql-db-prisma
      
    
The repository is fully documented. You should be easily able to set up your working environment in no time. If you want to see it in action and learn about it before starting to use it, I did a session at the Prima Meetup that you can watch here:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Helm and helmfile are great tools to automate kubernetes deployments. However, they have some subtleties that are sometimes hard to understand, and may lead to catastrophic problems. One of it is the difference between helmfile sync and helmfile apply, a question raised many times, for example in StackOverflow.
Running helmfile -h, the explanation of those two commands is:
sync ‚Üí sync all resources from state file (repos, releases and chart deps)
apply ‚Üí apply all resources from state file only when there are changes
But what does it mean exactly ? What are the differences and pitfalls ? Let's dive in together, starting at the basics of Helm 3 up to helmfile.
Note: if you are familiar with how Helm 3 upgrades work, you can skip directly to the last section.

This is part 2 of a two parts article. If you haven't done it yet, checkout part one ! 
In part one, we used a strong programming pattern to model our funnel: a state machine. We also built a FunnelProvider that provides us with a flexible api to synchronize it with React. 
Today we'll implement the actual steps of the funnel and see how we can update our state machine to store the data entered by the customer at each step. 
As always the code we'll write in this article is fully available here. However if you feel like coding along you can start from where we left off by cloning the repository from part 1
As we did last time, let's start with a bit of state machine theory ! If you're in a hurry, and you just want to see how it‚Ä¶]]></summary>

The code here is written in Typescript but I've tried to keep it friendly for JS readers, and I'll post a link to the equivalent JS at the end. 
Reduce allows us to take a container of data (like an array) and fold it into another data structure.
The reduce() method involves three parts:
A container of values, like an array, with which we need to update another structure (in sequence)
A function that lets us update a value (typically called the accumulator) based on an element from our array

E-commerce platforms and frameworks are usually built on a complex architecture to provide you with the best features as a developer and as a business owner.
Although this is good as they pack all useful features in one framework in the hopes no additional work needs to be done to launch a store, this can result in some issues. The store can be slow which would require a set of external tools to make it faster and in some cases big hosting plans to ensure the customers get the best experience.
In addition to that, customizing an e-commerce store to fit your or your client's needs using some platforms can be hard due to their tightly bound or complicated architecture.

The answer is pretty simple if you're planning to not go through the tedious docker documentation out there.
We mostly work as a team. Our peers install and work with dependencies, pulling from the repository and getting the code running in our development server is usually cumbersome. Dependencies may be missing, system requirements need to be met, storage issues, version control, quite a lot of other obstacles. Here comes the containers!!

The first thing to discuss is buffered writes. Any write to a linux local filesystem is done 'buffered', unless explicitly defined it not to, which is done by opening the file with the O_DIRECT flag. So all file interactions from the shell likely are done buffered, and the Postgresql database is also using buffered IO.
What happens when you perform a buffered write is that you don't actually write to the disk, but instead you write to memory. Because currently the latency of most disk IO/writes is still much higher than memory IO latency (~ 25us/modern SSD vs 160ns/memory, although very configuration specifi‚Ä¶]]></summary>

Liveness - happens time to time after app is started and tells if it needs to be restarted.
Readiness - happens time to time after app is started and tells if it able to handle requests.
Startup and Liveness checks are the most important, so let's focus on them.

Technology Stack 
A skilled mobile application developer will help you develop a user-friendly and captivating app like Tinder. Companies must have the skill and expertise required to create such apps. Stacks of technologies are as follows:
Android/iOS mobile app stacks
Swift
Backend/API Stack
Redis
Website Stack
Node.js
Developing each of the features above will take a certain amount of time. For an idea of how many hours the basic functionality of a dating app like Tinder needs to be programmed on iOS and Android, check out the table below.
Authorization - 22 hours 
The above are all approximations of the time it would take for a function to be developed. You can increase the functions of your dating app at a cost but also increase the development time. If you know the total time required for development, you can calculate what it will cost by checking the hours charged by the developer. 
The location of the team should also be taken into account. You should prepare to double the cost of an app if you hire someone to build it in the USA or Western Europe. Conversely, developers in Eastern Europe can create the same app for a much lower cost.
Therefore, development of an app like Tinder the requires a specialized team. If you're building a Tinder clone, your team should probably include:
2 Backend developers
Wrapping It Up!!
All of the data above tells us clearly that the popularity of dating apps is growing and that a decline in such amazing apps is not expected in the future. Whenever you plan to develop a dating app, decide on the essential feature first. Depending on how long each feature is going to take, you can estimate the development costs. For that intent on building their dating app like Tinder, seek guidance from a company with experience and expertise. Hiring experienced developers is necessary to make a user-friendly and market-ready app in the first go.]]></summary>

TypeScript builds on JavaScript to add variable types (like you see in Rust, C++ or Java), making it easier to spot mistakes in your code. Adding types to TypesScript code can get old quickly! GraphQL is a typed language which means you just have to reference the GraphQL schema in the right way to be able to generate types automatically for your TypeScript code base.
Using the graphql-codegen tool, we will see how you can generate a single file containing all the types from the GraphQL API you are using. Then when you run a query, you will just need to import the type from that file. If you a‚Ä¶]]></summary>

XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. 
Let us understand it with an example:
Suppose we visited a website named abc.com who sell some good cloths but prices were high and we close the website later we received a mail where we actually got an off of 90% and there was a link 
www.abc.com/shirts/fullsleves/productid=1asd212Sda/!@a1 
so we ordered some clothes from that link and completed our transaction online. Suddenly we got an update and we came to know that some more transactions happened from our account which were not done by us. ‚Ä¶]]></summary>

üí° Unix-like operating systems such as Linux do not have an undelete command.
When we delete something with rm , it's gone.Linux assumes we're smart and we know what we're doing.

One of the big problem can cause wildcards. so be particularly with them.
For Example : if we want to delete just the JS files in directory we type:
rm *.js
* and the .js like so:
rm * .js
.js
There is many ways to avoid this problem, here is 2 useful tip: 
-i (interactive) option, which prompt the user for confirmation  ,before deleting an existing file.
rm i *.js
rm: remove regular empty file 'mk.js'?
2 - whenever we use wildcards with rm, test the wildcard first with ls. This will let we see the files that will be deleted. Then we can press the up arrow ‚òùÔ∏è to recall the command and replace ls with rm.]]></summary>

O que podemos fazer √© atualizar o m√≠nimo necess√°rio (e rezar), normalmente s√≥ atualizar o que representa um problema de seguran√ßa.
Para nos ajudar podemos utilizar a flag --security na execu√ß√£o do yum.
Antes de come√ßarmos vamos olhar uma sa√≠da padr√£o de um yum update, repare na quantidade de pacotes que ser√£o instalados (10) e atualizados (96)

1 ‚Äì Garante que o pacote yum-plugin-security esteja instalado:
# yum -y install yum-plugin-security

2 - Voc√™ pode listar todas as atualiza√ß√µes de seguran√ßa dispon√≠veis com o seguinte comando:
# yum --security check-update

3 ‚Äì Agora vamos fazer a instala√ß√£o somente as atualiza√ß√µes de seguran√ßa com o menor update poss√≠vel
# yum --security update-minimal

Dica extra.
Precisa fazer isso em v√°rios servidores? Utilize o Ansible, com o par√¢metro security: yes, para isso :)

When you start working as an application security engineer, you'll expect to find straightforward tasks to do.

Viewing data breaches and cyber incidents all the time proves that no one out there has a mature cyber security program.
If you are already working in this field, I imagine that you sometimes feel that you're achieving nothing and you are more invisible inside the organization. The bigest challenge I see is how to increase your visibility and have more transparency with your manager and the rest of your co-workers.

Remediation Activities 
For Example, using information obtained from log files and other sources, a SOC member can recommend a better network segmentation strategy or a better system patching regimen. Improving existing CyberSecurity is a major responsibility of a SOC. 
Compliance
Organisation secure themselves through conformity to a security policy, as well as external security standards, such as ISO 27001x, the NIST CyberSecurity Framework(CSF) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Organisations need a SOC to help ensure that they are compliant with an important security standards and best practices. 
Coordination and Context
Above all, a SOC team member helps an organisation coordinate desperate elements and services and provide visualized, useful information.

What are Operators?
Operators are pure functions. They take observable as input and return output as observable.

switchMap‚Äì cancels the inner observable when outer observable emits a value
catchError‚Äì catches the error and passes to error handling function
