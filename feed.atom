But when a debugging problem keeps me up at night and gets me to that state of mind where a career of raising sheep in New Zealand seems like an attractive option... That's when I need to back off and walk through this process in an orderly fashion. This process never fails. When you walk through it, you can track any problem.
Now I'm going to skip a lot of common advice. Most debugging tutorials start with things that relate to a process: File an issue, reproduce as a test case etc. I think there's plenty written on that online. People use it as filler since they assume debugging is a simple process. It is sometimes. But as we will learn in this blog, there's a lot of depth and breadth to this mislea…]]></summary>

If I could build an app of any kind, the first thing that comes to mind pertains to wait times for ordering food. Just like Disney has wait times for rides, food service places should have wait times for lines to order food. Especially in a college town, time is money, so to limit the amount of time waiting would be priceless. Some could argue order ahead, but that is not always the case or an option for certain establishments.
This application would be used for the time efficient human being, college student, or working class. It really would be used by anyone universally. If you believe time is money, this application is for you.

You know all about phishing. From time to time, emails purporting to be from Facebook or your bank drift into your inbox and insist you “verify your account.” Look closer and you spot the telltale signs of a scam: a sketchy-looking sender address, sloppy writing, and a complete lack of personalization. You sigh and hit delete.
It’s easy to be cynical about opportunistic, mass-mailed phishing attempts. Although some look genuine to even the most cautious eye, others feel decidedly amateurish and are readily identifiable.

Because of the sheer volume of Twitter bots, Twitter requires an application before you can use their API. While you can start using your API key as soon as you submit the application, some features might be restricted until it is reviewed.

Example:
console.time("answer time");
// where `answer time` is a label to identify this timer
alert("Click to continue");
console.timeLog("answer time");
alert("Do a bunch of other stuff...");
console.timeEnd("answer time");

Most of the time you just want to time a whole event and don't care about intermediate steps, though. Then, you just need console.time, console.timeEnd.

I said “native” because previously you could set response headers either using CloudFront Functions or Lambda@Edge.
And one of the common use cases for that was to set security headers. So now you don’t need to add intermediate requests processing to modify the headers: CloudFront does that for you with no additional fee.
Starting from the 3.64.0 version of Terraform AWS provider, you can create the security headers policies and apply them for your distribution.
Let’s see how that looks!

The act of localizing an app is a common problem because of the dynamic nature, which stops tools like Google Translate from working. Therefore a large wealth of internationalization tools exists solves the problem in various ways, but in this tutorial I am going to showcase inlang which is a way to ensure type safety in your translations so you never miss a translation again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article we are going to talk about the differences between Javascript and Typescript, they are two languages that are widely use nowadays in all types of projects, JS was the first to be introduced as client-side language. As time passed the projects were JS was being used started to be too complex and heavy, thats were TS enters the game, and starts as language to resolve all the problems that JS was having at the moment, nowadays TS is a language widely used also and is becoming bigger and bigger, so I hope that with this article I can help you a little bit to now any differences or to resolve any doubts.

There are many differences, now I'm going to show you a comprehensible list of differences.
JS is used for client-side mostly while TS is used mostly for both client-side and server-side.
TS has an improved readability, since JS requires a lot of manual detection of bugs and errors, this has been improved a lot by TS.
TS has static typing while JS doesn't support it since JS is a dynamically-typed language.
TS supports ES6.
TS has a full support in modern IDE.
TS can also convert its code to JS if necessary.
Using TS means that you can use OOP(Object-oriented programming) principles.
In JS functions are considered an object and they can have its own method and properties.
The choice is up to you at the end on what to choose if you want to work with this languages, you will have to balance the pros and the cons between both of them, and make an educated choice. Usually the option you choose will come from different variables like having in mind the size and complexity of the project you are going to work on, there are more differences between this two languages but the ones I wrote are the main ones and the important ones, I hope you like the article, any queries feel free to comment and ask!]]></summary>

Suddenly, you see blocks of code where you can't understand what kind of data passes there.
In this article, I want to introduce you to Typescript while playing with code. Thus, you see it in action and don't overflow with an unnecessary theory. I recommend playing with the code you'll meet here in Typescript Playground.

Although this article is on creating an api, GraphQL is the best friend of frontend developers. The idea behind is to let the UI component decide its data reqirements and send a query to GraphQL to fetch exactly what it needs.

If you ever tried to use GPU-based instances with AWS ECS, or on EKS using the default Nvidia plugin, you would know that it's not possible to make a task/pod shared the same GPU on an instance. If you want to add more replicas to your service (for redundancy or load balancing), you would need one GPU for each replica.
And this doesn't seem to be going to change in the near future for ECS (see this feature request)
GPU-based instances are expensive, and despite the fact that some Machine Learning frameworks (e.g. Tensorflow) are pre-configured to use the entire GPU by default, that's not always the case. ML service…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post illustrates deployment process of Server Side Rendered Angular application, as can be guessed from the title.
Though, AWS has a dedicated service for deploying SSR applications, called  AWS Amplify, but, as of writing this post, Angular Universal is not supported by Amplify. There are multiple other options available to achieve the required result. One of the more popular ones were the usage of a third party API, called Serverless. But, It was particularly challenging for me to find a clean and vanilla solution as I was juggling between different options.
Below, I will demonstrate the usage of AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy Angular SSR.     
Open AWS Management Console and go to Elastic Beanstalk homepage. Click on Create Application.

Next, Give your application a name, and select Platform and Platform branch as illustrated below.

On the same page, proceed with uploading the zipped dist folder of your Angular app which gets generated upon building your app in the local system. Now, click on Configure more options button. 

On the next screen, click on the Edit button on the software tile.
  
Provide the Node Command considering dist as root. The path used in Node Command generally is of the folder where file to be run is placed.

Save the Configuration and click on Create App subsequently. Environment setup will take a few minutes, after which it will provide the Health status, logs and Deployment URL, as, can be seen below.

Despite most organizations' desire to be "data-driven", much of the quality storytelling we do remains anecdotal and story driven.
On the one hand, quantifying abstract concepts like "maturity", "quality", or "maintainability" is problematic. On the other hand, quantifiable metrics like "time-to-hello-world" and "uptime percentile" don't describe the health of an API ecosystem or whether improvement efforts are improving the speed and safety of overall API development.
I joined Postman in April, just as the company was preparing its latest survey. I saw it as an opportunity to build upon existing industry devops insights by testing whether they also apply to API program performance.
In the 180th Net #API Notes, I deep dive on the Postman 2021 State of the APIs Report; specifically, what are the four behaviors of high-performing API teams? And how do we measure them?

How can you reflect this user categorization on your application to check users' privileges?
How can you deal with roles in your code?
Is role control appropriate for Web APIs?

We are proud to announce that Auth0, a product unit within Okta, has been recognized as a Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management, Worldwide. Gartner defines the Access Management market as: "The access management (AM) market is defined by customers’ needs to establish, enforce, and manage run-time access controls for internal and external types of identities, as well as machine identities, interacting with cloud, modern standards-based web and legacy web applications" Auth0 focuses on SaaS-delivered developer-centric and Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) use cases.
For more information, please download the full 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management report.

The Magic Quadrant recognized Okta (Auth0) as a Leader based on our Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision.  
Auth0 believes that CIAM should do more to balance the three forces of security, privacy and convenience — not just keeping the bad actors out, but also driving customer loyalty and conversion and revenue to create a great experience for our customers, partners, and their end-users.
We believe vendors' experience in the space is a key consideration for Gartner in their Magic Quadrant Evaluations. As stated by one of our customers in their review of Auth0, included in the 2021 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer Access Management Report, Auth0 comes with great features out-of-the-box. We went live easily with Auth0 as our Identity Provider. The platform/vendor does not just support us in a technical angle, but also understanding our user journey and sharing their experience (with other clients) and what approaches to take to minimize risk and even enhance user experience during the migration. — VP, Core Product Development, Retail industry

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have many different places where I have to use the same logic, so I have generalized my logic system into a class...
...
const contextLayer = new contextLayerCore(...useState([]));
...

This class provides me with a bunch of functions like addContext, removeAll, etc. However, the addContext function is a bit problematic...
...
addContext(context: listing) {
  this.setState([...this.state, context]);
}
...

Simple enough; all it does is append an object using the setState function which should re-render any components using the state. Here's the problem, this causes an infinite loop...
...
this.setState([...this.state, context]);
//                     ^
// also updates when state updates, hence re-runs the setState function
...

This causes and infinite loop. I could using useEffect(..., []) to make it not be dependant, however, this is a function inside a class, thus it breaks React's rules of hooks.
I have to retain the functionality of this class, so I cannot move the function up into the component(s) as a lot of components use this class and would simply create duplicate code.
And example of where it is used...
...
<ContextSuperContainer render={contextLayer.state} />
...

What should I do? Is there an alternative of useEffect? Should I be using a different system for this purpose?
Convert it to a custom hook!
export default function useContextLayer (initialState: Array<listing>) {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

  return {
    removeAll: () => {...},
    addContext: () => {...},
    // doesn't even need an useEffect anymore

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's see how you can connect to a MySQL database using Node.js, the popular JavaScript runtime environment.


Create a MySQL database



mysql -u USER -p



CREATE DATABASE employees;

USE employees;
Create a table in the database:


CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (    
id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,    
name varchar(50),    
PRIMARY KEY (id)  
);
INSERT INTO employees (nombre) VALUES ("Silvia");  
INSERT INTO employees (nombre) VALUES ("Luigi");  
INSERT INTO employees (nombre) VALUES ("Alejandro");




 


Install node-mysql
You will need to have the node-mysql package installed, so if you don't have it installed, you will need to install it. To do this you must use the npm package manager:


npm install mysql



Establish the MySQL connection



var mysql = require('mysql');  
var conexion= mysql.createConnection({      
   host : 'localhost',      
   database : 'employees',      
   user : 'USER',      
   password : 'PASS',  
});    
conexion.connect(function(err) {     
   if (err) {          
       console.error('Error de conexion: ' + err.stack);          
       return;      
   }      
   console.log('Connected to the identifier ' + conexion.threadId); 
});



conexion.query('SELECT * FROM empleados', function (error, results, fields) {
      if (error)          
          throw error;        
      results.forEach(result => {          
      console.log(result);      
      });  
});
Finally, terminate the connection:


connection.end();

This is the last article in the series and in this final article we will be taking a look how to create a wrapper component for conditional rendering of components based on user permissions.
Why do we need it? Because it is more convenient to wrap a component in a wrapper than to call a hook in every case we need conditional rendering.
Let's create an interface to represent the props of our future wrapper component in our models folder:
// ./permissions-validation/models/with-permissions-props.ts
import { ReactElement } from 'react';

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most people have seen them, those immensely long import paths like the example below:
import module from "../../../../../modules/module.ts";

To improve this, you can use import aliases and make it look like the example
import module from "@/modules/module.ts";

The benefit of this is readability and that you can move files and folders to sub or parent directories without changing the import paths.
Tools like Vue CLI are supporting this out-of-the-box, but if you want to use the new blazing-fast build tool Vite, you'll need to (at the time of writing)
For this to work, all tools need to know that import aliases are used by modifying each tool's configuration file.
Vite has a configuration file called vite.config.ts and by adding the resolve object Vite will know that import aliases are being used:
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import path from "path";

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
    },
  },
});

By adding a paths object to the compilerOptions inside the tsconfig.json like the example below TypeScript will also know that import aliases are being used:
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src"]
    }
  }
}

At last Jest knows that aliasses are being used by adding the moduleNameMapper to the jest.config.ts configuration file like the code below:
// jest.config.ts
module.exports = {
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "^@/(.*)$": "<rootDir>/src/$1",
  },
};]]></summary>

GraphQL is a query language designed to build client applications by providing an intuitive and flexible syntax and system for describing their data requirements and interactions.
GraphQL does not mandate a particular programming language or storage system for application services that implement it. Instead, application services take their capabilities and map them to a uniform language, type system, and philosophy that GraphQL encodes.
This provides a unified interface friendly to product development and a powerful platform for tool-building.

 Everyone has widespread access to windows but they may or maynot be savvy enough to run their favorite flavour of linux due to various constraints
WSL2 really makes life easy for those devs who can't access linux through a cloud provider or locally run it on their devices.
WSL has support for various distros like Debian, Arch and Ubuntu.
Now coming to the interesting part, windows has all access to the CPU and memory resources in your device and it is built in a way which will optimize the resource utilization but how do you limit your linux subsystem, let  us say you'd like to manipulate the configuration to suit your needs the best, then you should follow these steps.
Shut your current running instance of WSL using this command
wsl --shutdown

Run this command through powershell as administrator
Create a configuration file for WSL on your user profile directory
notepad "$env:USERPROFILE\.wslconfig"

 This is the most important step in this project, so please follow carefully 
The following parameters define their corresponding resources:
CPU  = > cores dedicated to WSL
Memory  = > RAM allocated to WSL
AutoMount  = > Mount your default NTFS drive to your subsystem
Boot => defines your booting options for services
Kernel  = > Custom kernel for linux
LocalhostForwarding  = > for port-forwarding your applications running on localhost
My configuration for CPU and memory:
[wsl2]
memory=9GB  
processors=4

This is how you can configure your resources for WSL 😀. Feel free to leave some comments down below⬇️.
