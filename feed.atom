This lab 4 is a new device to be added to ssg. Instead of entering and executing a command for each desired function, if you enter -c or --config config.json using the config.json file, the It should be executed based on the command and the value of the command, and I was assigned a requirement to work in the ssg of another student, not my ssg.

A hash fragment in the URL (i.e. www.mypage.com/article#fragment) to the anchor name is the value of either the name or id attribute when used in the context of anchors.
According to w3.org, it must observe two rules, Uniqueness: is said must be unique within a document, and String matching: Comparisons between fragment identifiers and anchor names must be done by exact (case-sensitive) match.
The id attribute may be used to create an anchor at the start tag of any element.
This example illustrates the use of the id attribute to position an anchor in an H2 element.

Then it got forced upon me and I had no choice but to learn it while at the same time learning a new framework. That was very hard indeed as I wasn't sure if I was learning something React or something TypeScript. Separating the two would have been a whole lot easier.

You may also know languages that strongly favor functional patterns are the roots of the skills taught at boot camps. This includes languages like JavaScript (JS) and Python. What is the problem with this?
At least Python's type-safe rating is "strong." JS's type-safe rating is "weak." Let's talk about JS. JavaScript has been the most-loved and the most-hated programming language all at once for quite some time now. A lot of the hate for JavaScript is due to its absence of a strict typing system. Where a language such as Java will crucify you for a null check, JavaScript says, "A string divided by a string? Yeah, that might work. Let's run it."
For noobs, that's great!…]]></summary>

After much research and deliberation, I've concluded the best way for me to achieve this is to separate my local hardware from the software which will run on it. Essentially, I'll be treating my hardware as a "local cloud", and create VM Images that I will deploy running my application stack. (Azure Stack HCI has the right idea here!)
When developing and testing on cloud providers, they always have a base image available to use as a starting off point. Not so for my local cloud!

TL;DR This is the final result!😉 (The following video frame refresh is x10 faster than actual. I edited by a video editor.)

I prepared 160 x 90 cells in a Google Sheet and changed cell colors by using Google Sheets API. The API has a API to change cell colors by one API call in bulk. I called the API for each video frame and played a video.
First, I converted the famous video "Big Bunny" to JPG images by using ffmpeg. I used 1 image per second and generated 300 images. According to my experiments, Google Sheets API needs ~3 sec to refresh cell colors by a API call so I selected much less images than video frames. And I resized the image frame …]]></summary>

In this article we will look at both data structures (Promises or Observables) briefly and which one of them we should be using in 2021.
Promises are one of the coolest features of working with JavaScript, they can help you reduce a lot of call back functions, throw in the await/async syntax and you are dealing with asynchronous code as if you were writing synchronous code and still reducing lines of code and multiple .then chaining. 
Observables are an ergonomic way of dealing with streams of asynchronous event/data as…]]></summary>

What are Operators?
Operators are pure functions. They take observable as input and return output as observable.
map– a transformation operator works similar to Array.prototype.map
switchMap– cancels the inner observable when outer observable emits a value
catchError– catches the error and passes to error handling function

  What we'll learn in this article


Hi everyone! 👋
Today, I'm going to share and analyze a pattern that I've become quite fond of recently for managing state management in a way that is truly domain agnostic.
We'll do this by first discussing a new pattern for implementing state management code using RxJS in this article. In a follow up article (that I've committed to releasing next friday), we'll demonstrate its "domain agnosticism" by using the same code to create a small app in vanilla JS [by which I simply mean "JS without a framework/library"], Angular, and React.
There's something of a perquisite of some more basic JS knowledge, and familiarity with RxJS would helpful…]]></summary>

But is cost the only reason to outsource software development company? While it may be a significant factor, there are a lot of other things that play a major role in enabling companies to decide whether outsourcing for custom software development is a good idea or not.

Nodejs is a javascript runtime environment. So, what exactly is the javascript runtime? You may be familiar with the term javascript. Javascript is a programming language that you may use to control your DOM in your browser and helps to play with the page loaded in the browser. It is a browser-based scripting language that allows you to interact with a page after it has been loaded, making it a critical component in developing interactive user interfaces in the browser. However, javascript has other exciting uses as well. Nodejs is a modified version of javascript with added features.

So, in a nutshell, Node.js takes javascript and places it in a new environment. You might say that allows you to run javascript code on the server, but it can theoretically run on any system.…]]></summary>

If what comes your way is putting guards in your functions, this post will open up a world for you as this one was for me. Using checks is not enough.
You will be both wolf and sheep. I created the function below so that it had everything you need to learn attack and related defenses from the techniques:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm Dustin, and today I want to talk about the experience of adding new feature for a static site generator written by Vivian.
A SSG is a command line tool that helps users to convert .txt files or .md files into .html files. 
This project is quite fun and offers me a bunch of new knowledge.
First off, I created an issue mentioning about what I wanted to improve in on her code. I listed all the necessary tasks to be done and sent the issue. After she accepted and assigned me to the issue, I started to write code right away and created a pull request for the code I wrote. It's actually not a big deal for me at all because her code was pretty clean and understandable. Although she requested a few changes in my code, everything went well and my pull request got merged right after that.
Same thing happens in my code I guess because we had no trouble understanding each other's code. The process was quite straight forward, she filed an issue -> I accepted it -> she coded it -> I requested some changes as she added some extra lines that were not necessary. However, there was one thing I had to do which is pulling her code into my machine so that I could test it out. While testing her code, I just realized that I had a quite big bug in my code that I didn't know about. However, her issue was just for the new feature about config file, so I decided to create another issue about the bug I mentioned above and resolved it after her code got merged.

One of the great benefits of Doppler is keeping your project in sync. We want to be able to sync our app wherever we develop and deploy. It only takes a few minutes to integrate the Vercel marketplace with Doppler, and that is what we will be doing in this tutorial
In this tutorial we will learn how to install the Doppler integration from Vercel’s new marketplace. Learn how to sync the secrets in your doppler project for deployment.
The first thing we want to do is to login to our doppler account. I won’t be touching the details of creating an account and login into doppler, because I have already done an introduction to doppler in a previous post. So once we have logged into Doppler, we head over to Vercel and add our project we want to integerate doppler with.

As the COVID-19 pandemic pushed customers towards e-commerce, its share of total retail sales has been significantly increased since 2020 and is expected to grow in the coming years. With e-commerce being on the rise, fraudsters are hot on the track of online shopping businesses and their customers. 
According to a Juniper research report, e-commerce retailers are at risk of losing over $20 billion in 2021 due to online fraudulent activities. This represents an 18% increase, compared to $17.5 billion recorded last year. Thus, it’s essential to be aware of security aspects to be able to prevent security breaches.

Every wonder why your meta tags seem to work sometimes, but not other times? It is because ngOnInit is NOT an async function, even with async, neither is a constructor which must return this, and neither is an async pipe in your template. Sometimes the fetches return on time, other times they don't. So, I added this post:
ngOnInit does NOT wait for the promise to complete. You can make it an async function if you feel like using await like so:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all agreed about not manipulating data inside component or better to say presentation layer.
So I decided to put logout logic inside guard, this way I will be able to just call logout route and done!
For this I've configured my authentication module routes like this:
{
    path: 'login',
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false }
  },
  {
    path: 'register',
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: true }
  },
  {
    path: 'logout',
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false },
    canActivate: [LogoutGuard]
  }

I love to keep things as simple and low as possible 😁
For log out I've added canActivate field and passed the LogoutGuard, the guards have the ability to return UrlTree. It is awesome, let's see how the guard implemented:
@Injectable()
export class LogoutGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {
  }

  canActivate(): UrlTree {
    this.store.dispatch(logout());
    return this.router.createUrlTree(['auth', 'login']);
  }
}

That's it!
The canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!
After this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.
Thank you for reading 🙏🏽

FTP is an old and insecure protocol that can be used to transfer files between local networks or computers connected through the Internet.

  Telegraph.nvim


Check out the project readme
I want a simple way to make remaps into shell commands that can open new tmux
For example I want to make remaps to do things like open the current file in lookatme.
# vim :terminal
nnoremap <leader>s <cmd>Telegraph pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark<cmd>

# tmux session
nnoremap <leader><leader>s <cmd>lua require'telegraph'.telegraph({cmd='pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark', how='tmux'})<CR>

# tmux popup
nnoremap <leader><leader>S <cmd>lua require'telegraph'.telegraph({cmd='pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark', how='tmux_popup'})<CR>

The main goal here is that remaps become one liners that can just be put
init.vim without creating a whole new lua module for each
telegraph takes in a how argument to determine where to tun the command.j
term(default) runs command in the built in terminal
tmux runs command in a new tmux session and joins it.
tmux_popup runs command in a tmux popup window.
tmux_popup_session runs command in a tmux session and displays it in a popup
subprocess runs command in a subprocess
The current set of format strings that can be used with telegraph.  Placing
{} within your command will get rendered into something with
cword - the current word under the cursor
cWORD - the current BIG Word under the cursor
cline - the current line under the cursor
filepath - the filepath of the current file
filename - the filename of the current file
parent - the parent directory of the current file
current_session_name - name of the current tmux session
cwd - the current working directory
Check out the repo and give
it a star if its something that interests you.]]></summary>
