In this article, we’ll learn about how systems communicate seamlessly with each other through a process called serialization and deserialization and how we can apply that in TypeScript. The process is seamless because of how the transferable data is handled.
As a user, when you access any application, you do so to retrieve information. This information is made up of data that must be stored somewhere; this is where serialization comes in.
By the end of this article, you should be able to understand how data transfers from one location to another, what format it transfers in, and the possible options for storing data streams. We’ll also cover technical issues that can arise when working with serialization in TypeScript.

In this tutorial, I will show you how Materialize works by using it to run SQL queries on continuously produced nginx logs. By the end of the tutorial, you will have a better idea of what Materialize is, how it's different than other SQL engines, and how to use it.
For the sake of simplicity, I will use a brand new Ubuntu 21.04 server where I will install nginx, Materialize and mzcli, a CLI tool similar to psql used to connect to Materialize and execute SQL on it.
If you want to follow along you could spin up a new Ubuntu 21.04 server on your favorite could provider. 
If you prefer running Materialize on a different operating system, you can follow the steps on how to install Materialize here:

It starts out simple: a <form> component, a couple input fields, and a submit button. But soon things get a little more complicated.
You think, "hmmm.. I want some more validation for this zip code field". So you add a custom workaround that validates the data in the input field.
Then, you think "I want to disable the submit button when the form is submitting". So you create another custom workaround that keeps track of what's submitting, and when things are complete, etc.
Then, you think "I want better error handling". So you add yet another workaround.
And over time that simple form balloons into a 400-line long super-component with multiple useEffects, useStates, and custom logic to handle all the edge cases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For someone who has worked with Typescript for the past 5+ years, I really miss it when it's not there. I find adding types to my javascript code a nice comfort. Writing automated tests with Cypress is no exception. With that being said, adding Typescript support to your Cypress applications is easy peasy!
Cypress ships with official type declarations for TypeScript. This allows you to write your tests in TypeScript. The first thing we need to do is install the typescript dependency.
yarn add --dev typescript

Next we need to update our tsconfig.json file with the following configuration:
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": ["es5", "dom"],
    "types": ["cypress"]
  },
  "include": ["**/*.ts"]
}

Finally we need to rename all of our .spec.js integration files to .spec.ts. 
If you are like me you've found the path to this point super simple! However, if your application is using Cypress's Custom Commands API your Cypress application is now angry.

Don't worry this is easy to fix! Let's open the file that contains our custom commands (usually support/commands.ts). This file should contain all of your commands as well as a Cypress namespace with a Chainable Interface. It is in this Interface we will add a reference to our custom command(s).
declare namespace Cypress {
  interface Chainable<Subject> {
    getBySel(selector: string): Chainable<Element>
  }
}

Cypress.Commands.add('getBySel', (selector: string, ...args: any[]): Cypress.CanReturnChainable => {
  return cy.get(`[data-test=${selector}]`, ...args)
})

And voilà our Cypress application is happy and now has full support for Typescript!

$ sudo apt install apache2 -y

We can find the available modules in /etc/apache2/mods-available. Here you will see the cgi.load module which you need to load.
Enable by-
$ sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/mods-available/cgi.load

Now as Apache configuration has changed, reload the apache service by -
$ sudo service apache2 reload

Apache2 recognizes cgi-scripts in the directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin, so we need to place the script in this folder.
Lets create a cgi script in python that returns the output of free -m command.
#!/usr/bin/python3

from subprocess import getstatusoutput as gso
import cgi

print("content-type:text/plain")
print()

print(gso("free -m")[1])

Make this script executable by -

        <updated>2021-11-12T14:59:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FreeCodeCamp states that if any component receives new state or new props, it re-renders itself and all its children. This is usually okay. But React provides a lifecycle method you can call when child components receive new state or props, and declare specifically if the components should update or not. The method is shouldComponentUpdate(), and it takes nextProps and nextState as parameters.


You can use shouldComponentUpdate() to prevent this by comparing the props. The method must return a boolean value that tells React whether or not to update the component. 


Code:




class OnlyEvens extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    console.log('Should I update?');
    // Change code below this line
    return true;
    // Change code above this line
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log('Component re-rendered.');
  }
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.props.value}</h1>;
  }
}

class Controller extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: 0
    };
    this.addValue = this.addValue.bind(this);
  }
  addValue() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      value: state.value + 1
    }));
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.addValue}>Add</button>
        <OnlyEvens value={this.state.value} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

Answer:




class OnlyEvens extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    console.log('Should I update?');
    // Change code below this line
    if (nextProps.value % 2 === 0) {
      return true
    } else {
      return false;
    }
    // Change code above this line
  }

You click the Add button and watch the order of events in your browser's console as the lifecycle hooks are triggered.]]></summary>

We've already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as onClick(). But, if you want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, you have to do this directly.


Today we have to add an event listener in the componentDidMount() method for keydown events and have these events trigger the callback handleKeyPress(). We can use the document.addEventListener() which takes the vent (in quotes) as the first argument and the callback as the second argument.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m absolutely thrilled about Lacework’s newest announcement—we just acquired Soluble, a startup whose mission is to help security and operations teams leverage IaC to scale cloud operations and security for businesses of all sizes. I’m especially excited about what Lacework’s incorporation of the Soluble technology means for devs like yourselves. There are countless benefits, but these are the three that I’m looking forward to the most.  
IaC is quickly becoming the primary mechanism to manage cloud infrastructure at scale. This shift increases both velocity and risk—to keep up, security and development teams need to quickly address the resulting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Integrating the Soluble technology into Lacework’s platform and teaming with Soluble’s experts prepares us to shift further left into developer workflows. 
Lacework can directly and quickly reach developer audiences. Soluble helps Lacework make security issues easier to solve by correlating cloud misconfigurations to IaC and enabling remediation at the source via pull requests. This expands Lacework’s platform to the places where developers are writing their code: directly in the UX/CLI/GitHub and GitLab. For developers to integrate with Lacework, they simply need to connect through Git. 
Soluble shares Lacework’s vision to build a modern, data-driven approach to cloud security. Implementing Soluble’s capabilities to the Lacework platform helps security and operations teams shift further left and partner with developers so they can manage applications and infrastructure efficiently, securely, and reliably.
I’d love to hear your thoughts on this acquisition in the comments below👇.]]></summary>

Until very recently, you had to go through multiple steps to enable WSL in your system. The worst part was that some of them were in the control panel, others in a terminal, and you also had to use the Microsoft Store to choose the Linux distribution you wanted.
With the recent changes they've made for the release of both Windows 11 and the latest Windows 10 update, installing WSL has become a straightforward task.
You only need to run one command if you're happy with using Ubuntu as your Linux distribution:
wsl --install

If you prefer another distribution, with this other command, you can list all the available distros:
wsl --list --online

And then, run the installation command:
wsl --install -d <distro name>

That's it! You'll have to restart your computer, and then it will ask you for a username and password. Once you create your user, the process will be completed.]]></summary>

But if you need a way to put those content elements in one place, you need something like a dictionary. It's a combination of small words and more extensive sentences.
Some applications need multiple languages, but others need one language but have loads of content to re-use. In this article, I want to show you the fastest way to create a content (some call it a dictionary) Service for your Angular application.
If you need a content service with multiple languages, I highly recommend NGX-Translate. This package offers a simple API and Pipe mechanism to re-use pieces of content but also supports multiple languages.

NodeJS nacio en el año 2009 bajo del nombre de Nodo por Ryan Dahl, quien para ese año formaba parte de Joyent, la empresa que sería la propietaria de NodeJS.
A pesar que en sus inicios NodeJS tuvo un desarrollo lento, llego a ser la potente plataforma que es hoy, consagrandose como una de las más amadas de los últimos años.
Es un entorno de ejecucion de un solo hilo de código abierto y multiplataforma, de ahí que tenga tan buena comunidad de soporte, se ejecuta bajo el motor JS V8 usado por Google.
En cuanto al lenguaje implementado, el elegido fue JS, mismo que se uso en Scripts del lado de cliente durante sus primeros años (20 aproximadamente), y solo podia usarse con la implementación de <script> en el que un desarrollador necesitaba trabajar con multiples lenguajes para moverse entre el Backend y Frontend.
NodeJS está escrito en los inmortales C y C++, y no dejando por fuera JS.
Aplicaciones de chat en tiempo real.
Aplicaciones web.
Servicios de API Rest.
IoT.
Streaming de datos.
Aplicaciones complejas de una sola Página.
Sobre el futuro de NodeJS es dificil de decirlo a ciencia cierta, dado que es una tecnología joven y que continua expandiendose, cuenta con un gran futuro por delante, pero tambien dependera del apoyo que la comunidad siga brindandole.

Avance un poco en la guia The odin Project

Instale linux Ubuntu y configure varias particiones necesarias para el curso mencionado arriba.
Aprendí sobre la diferencia de particiones GPT y MBR asi como que son Bios y UEFI.
Domine la herramienta rufus (algo mas para añadir al curriculum).
Avance hasta la sección de Fundamentos de HTML en The odin Project

Aprendí a agregar una clave ssh a mi cuenta de github.
Realice una instalación y configuracion de git en linux.
Cree un proyecto de ejemplo en github y realice cambios.
Aprendí que la mejor forma de hacer una explicación de los cambios en una confirmación (commit) es escribirlo de forma imperativa.
Volví a aprender los comandos basicos de linux como pwd, touch, cat, ls, cd entre otros.
Y eso es todo por hoy.
Espero que les vaya super bien y que tengan éxito con sus proyectos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why Python packaging can be hard


There may be a time in your development career where you need to author a package that extends Python w/ C or C++. In such a case your Python package needs to go through a compilation process, which converts C or C++ to binaries that work for a specific target system. This becomes really tedious when you think about how many flavors and versions of Linux there are.  Building a separate binary for Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, etc... Ugh so tiring.
Why Python packaging can be easy w/ manylinux


Fortunately, there is a solution. manylinux was birthed to make it easy for your Python packages to be compatible with most Linux variants. manylinux takes advantage of the fact that most distributions are mindful of backwards compatibility, and intentionally builds bdist wheels on an old version of a distribution. The idea is that if we build on an old supported version, the binaries produced are compatible with current versions.
So what is a manylinux really? Is it a ham sandwich?


No. Even better. It's a Docker image. manylinux is a Docker image built off a certain old versions of the CentOS operating system that comes bundled with libraries that are assumed to be present by default on almost all Linux systems.
You can find an example of manylinux distributions within the pandas project. Here are two (out of many) from the list of available pandas downloads from PyPI:
pandas-1.0.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
pandas-1.0.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_i686.whl

In this case, pandas has built manylinux wheels for CPython 3.7 supporting both x86-64 and i686 architectures. It's manylinux so this wheel should be compatible for many linux :)
Happy packaging!]]></summary>

Have you ever had developer teams request ownership of a full subscription to be able to freely experiment?
You still want to keep isolation, segregate responsibilities and permissions.
Ability to experiment freely is paramount to innovation, but uncontrolled proliferation of subscriptions can bear a significant management overhead.
Can we have the best of both worlds? The short answer is: yes.
A resource group can be an effective boundary as it allows its contributors to yet create any resource, but also restrict the scope of access within a subscription.
You can also enforce tags and Azure policies to control costs and enforce security.

VS Code seems to be the 1 size fit all code editor. VS Code offers really seamless integration to develop on a remote connection such as the WSL 2 with the simple installation of an extension.
If you don't have it already, install VS Code from the official site. 

(You can also download the insiders build if you like living on the bleeding edge)
While installing VS Code, make sure to check the Add to Path option.

All you need to do is install the Remote - WSL Extension

Start a WSL 2 remote session
Ctrl + Shift + P and type in new wsl window to open up a new WSL 2 window and select the option

A new WSL 2 window should open up from the directory you were using.

It is advised to use VS Code from the Linux file system instead of the windows'. To do this just use the Open Folder option from the File menu.
Just traverse to ~ or $HOME directory and then add the projects to the Linux file system and use them from there.

It's the ideal solution for businesses looking to invest in a live-time running environment and application that spans platforms.
JavaScript support is one reason why developers are using Node.js for web application development It comes with a myriad of amazing features, including permitting developers to add web servers and network tools through JavaScript.

To get or access the properties and methods of the main HTML element tag without having errors or red squiggly lines in TypeScript, you have to assert the type for the main HTML element tag using the HTMLElement interface in TypeScript.
The errors or warnings are shown by the TypeScript compiler since the compiler doesn't know more information on the main HTML element tag ahead of time. But we know that we are referencing the main HTML tag and thus we can tell the compiler to use the HTMLElement interface which contains the declarations for properties and methods.
// get reference to the first 'main'
// HTML element tag in the document
// with type assertion using the HTMLElement interface
const mainTag = document.querySelector("main") as HTMLElement;

sudo apt-get update
