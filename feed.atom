In this Quick guide, I would show you how to fetch data in a react app by making an HTTP request to a REST API using 4 different patterns.
Before I begin, let’s have a refresher on what REST APIs are:
What is a REST API?
A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for “REpresentational State Transfer”.
In this guide, we would be making use of the Github REST API and its sample response looks like this:

Passwords have been our main digital authentication method since 1961, though its vulnerability to hacking was demonstrated within one year.
Encrypted password storage and public-key cryptography were developed in the late 60s to early 70s.
But the 1980s brought the first version of "passwordless" authentication. This came in the form of dynamic, one-time passwords (OTP) held on physical fobs.
OTPs eventually developed into two protocols: time-based OTPs (TOTP) and cryptographed hash-based message authentication codes or HMAC OTPs (HOTP). Dynamic OTPs are still widely used as an authentication protocol.
The late 1990s brought single sign-on (SSO) into use. SSO helped organizations manage user authentication across an entire network of applications. However, …]]></summary>

Passwordless authentication is exactly what it sounds like: an authentication strategy to verify user identity without the need for the user to manually enter knowledge-based information.
As we outlined in the previous article in this series, passwordless methodologies have been in use since the 1980's, but were ultimately popularized in the 2000's as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on (SSO) became standards.
From MFA and SSO to 'passwordless'
Multi-factor authentication requires users to provide multiple unique ways of identifying themselves, which can include:
  Something the user knows, like an ID number, user name, and/or password
  Something the user has, like a token, authenticator app, ubikey, email address, or phone number

If you work in cybersecurity or any computer-related field, sooner or later, you’ll have to explain public-key cryptography and digital signatures to non-technical people. With the recent rise of remote work and stories about system breaches, computer security has become a topic of discussion even among laypeople.
After trying to explain public-key cryptography and digital signatures to some clients with varying degrees of success, I wanted to develop an analogy that explained them and was easy to remember. I’ve found that even techies get confused by the formal definitions, and many non-technical explanations just seem unsatisfying.
That’s when I stumbled upon Panayotis Vryonis’ article, Public-key cryptography for non-geeks. It became my go-to analogy until my computer science professor, Dr. Robin Dawes pointed out a flaw. I refined it with his help, and a suggestion from Matthew Ernest, and the result is below. I hope you find it helpful when trying to explain these concepts to anyone!
Imagine a box with a special lock, as pictured below:

The lock has three positions:
When the lock is at the “9:00” position, the box is locked, and its contents are inaccessible.
When the lock is at the “12:00” position, the box is unlocked, which means you can open it and view its contents.
When the lock is at the “3:00” position, the box is locked, and its contents are inaccessible.
In order to avoid wandering into endless “What if...?” tangents, assume that it’s prohibitively costly to pick the lock or break the box.

Hello everyone, my name is Dustin, today I want to write a blog about my progress of working with branches in Git. So this is the lab 03, which I have to create 2 parallel branches to work on different aspects of the program.
First off, I needed to decide what to add to my program. At the time, I had a few options like changing code block, or hr, or exit code for my program... So I thought that the exit code is a must that my program needed to have and the code block thing is quite more interesting than hr. After choosing what I needed to do, I had to file 2 issues so I had something to refer back to. 
The 2 issues I was talking about:
First one
Second one
Writing code for these 2 issues are quite straightforward. It took me a few minutes to finish it. However, I'm not so sure about the inline code block thing, and should ask my professor about it to make sure that's what he's looking for. 
So, for the first issue, I created a new branch called issue-18 and issue-19 for the second issue. When finishing the first issue, I had to git add and git commit and switched to branch issue-19 to continue coding. As I've done it, I also had to git add and git commit. After that, I had to use merge to merge those 2 branches. 
I used git merge issue-18 which is my first issue, git had no problem merging it. It was fast forward right away. However, for the second issue, when I git merge issue-19, instead of fast forward, Git used three way recursive strategy. Then, I just needed to push it to github so the code will be visible to everyone.

A dictionary is a common data structure in a programming language. As JavaScript developers, it’s important to work with type-safe dictionaries because there will be conflicts or unexpected issues if we store different types of data within the same dictionary.
In this article, we’ll cover how to build a type-safe dictionary using TypeScript.
First of all, we need to know what a dictionary is. In a programming language, a dictionary is a typical data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. JavaScript, however, does not offer a Dictionary type. Thankfully, we can create a type-safe dictionary in a few simple ways.

The common format for the argument is an object with an action property and a payload or value property. The action's value is generally a string such as setTitle. In the case of action:'setTitle', the value would then be the title you want to set on the state object. The problems with this approach are:
You have to look back at the reducer to see what the correct spelling and valid values of action are.
There is no type checking of the values that are linked with the action.

Speaking of the inline code block, I simply added another regex inside my splitInParagraphs function, which finds the text enclosed with backtick and then converting it to <code>..text..</code>. Thanks to my previous lab, I already had the idea of adding new features inside my program later one. I also use another regex to support converting --- to <hr> tag.
When I satisfy and try to test my program, everything works perfectly as I expect, then merging into my main branch. At first, the inline code block was merged smoothly with a fast-forward. However, when I merged the horizontal rule, it caused conflict because I modified the file for the second time with different issue, the content of the file is newer so it did not allow me to merge at that time. 
VSCode is really amazing, it detects my problem, and it shows some options I could do, which is Compare or Overwrite. I try both option in order to know the reason why I could not merge my second branch. I fix it by overwriting on my current file, and the branch is merged successfully.
This lab gives me a chance to practice with merge conflicts, and I am able to know what to do when I face the same problem again.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This library is great for displaying the 'active' users of your React application. The responsiveness of react-avatar-group is meant to be similar to the Google Docs user icons. Some live examples are available here.
If you need a more in-depth tutorial on using this package with actual, live users, check out this post here. Otherwise, here's a quick walk-through on how to use this package.

First, install the package:
npm install react-avatar-group

Then open up your React file and import the package, as follows:
// App.tsx
import AvatarGroup from 'react-avatar-group';

export default function App(){
  <AvatarGroup
    avatars={[
      "James", 
      "Ava", 
      {
        avatar: "Jackson",
        fontColor: "FF00FF",
        tooltip: "This is a custom tooltip"
      }
    ]}
  />
}

The only required prop to the AvatarGroup component is avatars, which is an array of strings or IAvatar objects, for more customization.
Another important prop is max. This will hide the avatars beyond a certain length with a custom overflow avatar (as seen in the gif above). displayAllOnHover will show all minions passed when the mouse hovers the avatar group, if there is a max number passed.
All the props for react-avatar-group can be seen here.
Using these other props, your AvatarGroup may look like the following:
import AvatarGroup from 'react-avatar-group';

export default function App(){
  <AvatarGroup
    avatars={[
      "James", 
      "Ava", 
      {
        avatar: "Jackson",
        fontColor: "FF00FF",
        tooltip: "This is a custom tooltip"
      }
    ]}
    initialCharacters={1}
    max={3}
    size={60}
    displayAllOnHover
    shadow={2}
  />
}]]></summary>

Redux has long been the go-to library for managing global state in React applications. Redux Toolkit, which Mark helped create, is a relatively new library that aims to be the "official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development." This post will go into my thoughts on the benefits and potential drawbacks of Redux Toolkit.
It's unopinionated. Redux requires you to put your global state in a store, and to manage that state via reducers and actions. An action is a simple JavaScript object with a type property, and a reducer is a pure function that transforms the old state into the new state based on an action. Beyo…]]></summary>

https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/
Now, the command is no longer docker-compose (although there is compose-switch), but rather, a Docker plugin, docker compose.
For some reasons, it had to rebuild my Dockerfile image again, even though I have built (and tagged) it before.
I saw that there that are releases for Windows and macOS (darwin, including arm64) as well; and it is already installed by default on Windows and macOS.
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
This one has absolutely my expected behavior. Nothing special. No surprise dangers.
podman-compose


This one uses podman, which is probably only available in Linux (and macOS), and requires podman.service user unit; so, probably cannot be started in Windows' WSL.
Goodies, other than can be rootless podman (i.e. no root privileges, nor usermod -aG docker $USER); is that it actually create a "pod" containing multiple containers.
So, what are unexpected behaviors I have found?
Cannot attach to virtual volumes, nor attach to non-existent folders (will not create a new folder)
podman-compose up $SERVICE_NAME does not work, unlike docker-compose


Ctrl+C does not destroy pod, nor "down", so podman-compose up >> Ctrl+C >> podman-compose up will give some friendly(?) errors


In contrast, docker-compose up >> Ctrl+C >> docker-compose up throws no error; also noticeably, logs  continue (just like Ctrl+X >> kill -CONT)
So, is Podman better than Docker, or is Docker itself getting better than alternatives?]]></summary>

SuperApiBoost es un cliente con dos comandos para generar una API REST NodeJS con lenguaje TypeScript usando express para las peticiones y mongoose para base de datos.
npm i -g superapiboost

sabo new -n=[NOMBRE]

Este generará la siguiente estructura:
📦API
 ┣ 📂node_modules
 ┣ 📂src
 ┃ ┣ 📂api
 ┃ ┃ ┣ 📂routes
 ┃ ┃ ┗ 📜index.ts
 ┃ ┣ 📂controllers
 ┃ ┃ ┗ 📜mongoBasic.ts #Basic CRUD Methods
 ┃ ┣ 📂interfaces
 ┃ ┣ 📂tools #transversal functions in the project
 ┃ ┃ ┗ 📜validateType.ts
 ┃ ┣ 📜app.ts
 ┃ ┣ 📜config.ts
 ┃ ┗ 📜mongo.ts
 ┣ 📜package-lock.json
 ┣ 📜package.json
 ┗ 📜tsconfig.json

Antes de arrancar el proyecto se debe agregar el uri de mongo en el archivo config.ts
y despues ejecutar
npm start

Para crear las rutas y controladores se debe crear un archivo .json con la siguiente estructura:
{
  "name":{
    "type":"string",
    "required":true,
    "default":"'Andy'"
  },
  "cellphone":{
    "type":"number",
    "required":false
  },
  "isValid":{
    "type":"boolean",
    "required":true,
    "default":"true"
  }
}

Y se debe ejecutar el siguiente comando para generar la ruta y controladores:
sabo generate -n=User -p="C:\models\user.json"

Arrancamos el proyecto con
npm start

Y ya se puede consumir el api rest desde cualquier cliente.]]></summary>

Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, This prevents Prop drilling and allows you to pass data around your react component tree efficiently.
There are external libraries like Redux that help with this, but luckily react implemented a built-in feature called React Context API that does this perfectly.
Let's dive in! 😁
To set up the project we need to first create a create-react-app application with the typescript template, To do this open up a terminal window and run the command
npx create-react-app context-typescript --template typescript

# or

yarn create react-app context-typescript --template typescript

As a Cloud Native Distributed Database, Nebula Graph comes with an open-source K8s Operator to enable boostrap and maintain Nebula Graph Cluster from a K8s CRD.
Normally it takes you some time to setup all the dependencies and control plane resources of the Nebula Operator. If you are as lazy as I am, this Nebula-Operator-Kind is made for you to quick start and play with Nebula Graph in KIND.
Nebula-Operator-Kind is the one-liner for setup everything for you including:
Docker
Install Nebula-Operator-Kind:
curl -sL nebula-kind.siwei.io/install.sh | bash

You will see this after it’s done

You can connect to the cluster via ~/.nebula-kind/bin/console as below:
~/.nebula-kind/bin/console -u user -p password --address=127.0.0.1 --port=30000

It’s in GitHub with more information you may be intrested in ;-), please try and feedback there~ https://github.com/wey-gu/nebula-operator-kind
Install on KubeSphere all-in-on cluster：
curl -sL nebula-kind.siwei.io/install-ks-1.sh | bash

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love Typescript and enjoy using it. However, it's not perfect and has its downsides.
Some downsides of Typescript (based on my experiences and what others have shared):
another thing to learn
more code boilerplate, especially for 3rd party libraries (glares at Redux)
installation costs initial time (but it makes up for it later with the type safety)
npm modules without typedef are difficult to work with TS
it only starts to pay off once your codebase gets larger and complex 
the resources are scattered in multiple places (no universal, comprehensive resource like MDN; I find the Typescript handbook lacking)
slower compile/build time
I most likely will use Typescript for most of my projects from here on, unless a third-party library has no type definitions or doesn't work well with it.
This post only expresses my thoughts and opinions (based on my limited knowledge) and is in no way a substitute for actual references. If I ever make a mistake or if you disagree, I would appreciate corrections in the comments!]]></summary>

I'm working on an app that had a requirement to show toast notifications for the various actions that were performed by the user or alerting on errors while performing background tasks. The app frontend is built using Vue 3 and typescript. 
So I started searching for a Vue 3 plugin to cut down on building my own but after spending a couple of hours and looking at the various options currently available I decided to build my own version.
A number of coffees and quite a few hair pulling hours later I finally came up with a solution. It took a couple more hours to build and test my theory and here I am to share what I did.
Notifications can be created from any component, route.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all know that API keys and connections can not be secured on the client side of an application. Hard coding API keys on the frontend is a quick and surefire way to have your API connection shutdown, API keys stolen, and have your API provider’s bill skyrocket. So what options are there if you do not want to maintain back end infrastructure? We will explore the recommended techniques for integrating 3rd party APIs into client side applications without having to build a backend. Then we will walk you through a step by step example of integrating a private API to create a Covid 19 tracker using KOR Connect.

I can't really remember what I was googling when I saw an advert by flexiple .So I sign up and the company recruiter schedule a call with me the following week.
After this process, flexiple prepared my CV by trying to  organize it to suite potential client i would work with in the future. Which was pretty straight forward and fast.
The final stage was divided into two stages
So I had to start preparing for this interview with leetcode and Hacker Ranker. I  started practicing algorithm, learnt recursion, binary search, Hash tree etc. 
To prepare further someone shared a picture of some AlogExpert algorithms  questions and  how it helped him land is current  job .I took a screen shot and started solving this algorithms one after the other .Note  I didn't solve all

To cut the long story short I did the code challenge and I am officially a freelance developer at flexiple looking forward to the journey ahead.]]></summary>

Obviously you may not get as attractive and beginner friendly interface as windows does but everything comes with a price doesn't it.
Here I will list 10 commands and explain them which you could try out yourself on your linux OS right away and experience it yourselves. 
df

this command will show the amount of available disk space and used disk space for file system to which you as a user currently has access to. For eg : if you have a dual boot system established in your pc and your linux OS doesn't have access to the D folder.If you run this command on your linux terminal then you wont be able to see the partiton of used and unused space of D folder. this command is same as when you open the disk management tool in windows.



top

This command when you type in your terminal it will show the active linux processes which are managed by your linux kernel. This command is used like how you would use task manager in windows, the difference being , it shows the details of all the processes in far more depth than windows does.
it will look something like this when you type the command.


this is what is meant by each column head.

you can press 'q' to exit this window in your termial.
ls
  


cd
cd [directory name]
cd ..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, I was working on Hyperpanels' dashboard feature and my coworker @albertobeiz said the sentence every front-end developer fears: 

Can we generate a PDF from that?
Let's see how I did it.
First, you'll need some help, so run the following commands:
npm i --save dom-to-image
npm i --save jspdf

Once we have this two packages, we can use them in our code 
import { jsPDF } from 'jspdf';
import domtoimage from 'dom-to-image';

Add an ID to the HTML element you want to print:
<ion-content class="grid-container">
    <div id="dashboard">

Finally, the function to turn that HTML into a PDF:
toPdf() {
    const dashboard = document.getElementById('dashboard');

    const dashboardHeight = dashboard.clientHeight;
    const dashboardWidth = dashboard.clientWidth;
    const options = { background: 'white', width: dashboardWidth, height: dashboardHeight };

    domtoimage.toPng(dashboard, options).then((imgData) => {
         const doc = new jsPDF(dashboardWidth > dashboardHeight ? 'l' : 'p', 'mm', [dashboardWidth, dashboardHeight]);
         const imgProps = doc.getImageProperties(imgData);
         const pdfWidth = doc.internal.pageSize.getWidth();
         const pdfHeight = (imgProps.height * pdfWidth) / imgProps.width;

         doc.addImage(imgData, 'PNG', 0, 0, pdfWidth, pdfHeight);
         doc.save('Dashboard for hyperpanels.pdf');
    });
}

This will create a PDF that will be saved from your browser:

And voilá, your HTML turned into a PDF:

You can also  use  the shorthand  version;
cd ~/Downloads

The important bit of the second command is the ~ and the /
The tilde (~) is the Linux shortcut for the home directory whereas ~/ references the start of a directory in the logged in users folder.

The new theme uses the official color palette from Tailwind and based on the design bits at Tailwind UI such as forms, modals and menus. If you are utilizing tailwind ui and looking for a fully featured UI component library, PrimeFaces with the Tailwind theme will be an excellent choice. Note that, the theme does not use tailwind classes and instead provides a look-alike style for a unified design when used together.

Linux has had support for Full Disk Encryption and technologies such as UEFI Secure Boot and TPMs for a long time. They are usually set up suboptimally in distributions.
Supported:
[x] Full Disk Encryption
[x] UEFI SecureBoot
[x] TPMs
We can separate the mechanisms and tools that we have to perform confidentiality and integrity operations in our systems in two large categories; disk encryption and data authentication. 
Before we dive into the direction of listing the technologies and tools that are available for each aformentioned category, it would be useful to explain the two concepts. 
Disk encryption translates into the process of transforming the data contained within a disk in such a way that reading them in clear-text form…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Environment variables in an Angular app are extremely useful for storing constants in your app that need to be used frequently, such as API url's, API access keys, Firebase config values and other general flags.
When a new Angular app is created via the CLI tooling using ng new, one of the folders generated is 'environments'.
By default, this folder contains two files:
- environment.ts
- environment.prod.ts
These files come prepopulated with the following code:
environment.ts:
export const environment = {
  production: false,
};

environment.prod.ts:
export const environment = {
  production: true,
};

The simple explanation of the usage of these files is that any values added into an environment file are injected into the compiled files when the Angular app is built. 
The different files …]]></summary>

First, we should not create that service as Singleton service, instead we should make sure the service will be specifically responsible only to handle some functionalities which is related to small part of our app at presentation layer or better to say, it will only take care of logics which related to the Dump component.

openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /home/user/Nvidia.key -outform DER -out /home/user/Nvidia.der -nodes -days 36500 -subj "/CN=Graphics Drivers"

First command will ask for a password. After reboot enter the same password. (** Prompt will ask for characters in specific position of the password. Do not enter the whole password. **)
sudo mokutil --import /home/user/Nvidia.der
sudo reboot

Check if keys are enrolled
sudo mokutil --list-enrolled # or sudo mokutil --list-enrolled | grep -i Graphics

Updated the /etc/dkms/sign_helper.sh. Add/update the line with the newly created key paths.
/lib/modules/"$1"/build/scripts/sign-file sha512 /home/user/Nvidia.priv /home/user/Nvidia.der "$2"
Update /etc/dkms/framework.conf Uncomment the line where sign_tool is mentioned
sign_tool="/etc/dkms/sign_helper.sh"
If you have already added dkms modules before changing the sign file, first remove and then add them again.
sudo dkms status # Check status of dkms module
sudo dkms remove <module>/<version> -k <kernel_version>
Eg. sudo dkms remove hid-asus-rog/1.0.2 -k 5.10.0-8-amd64
sudo dkms status # Check uninstalled again
sudo dkms add . # in the cloned directory of dkms module
sudo dkms build <module>/<version>
sudo dkms install <module>/<version>

For installing Nvidia driver using the .run file and enrolled keys. Get-the-Driver-here
sudo sh ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-460.73.01.run -s --module-signing-secret-key=/home/user/Nvidia.key --module-signing-public-key=/home/user/Nvidia.der

However in Angular 12 you get an error:

Hi All
I am an avid user of ZEN for over 10 years now and it works for me.

But it seems that Intersystems are no longer actively developing it (or ZEN Mojo), the only published reference to this  is here
As an aside, Intersystems makes fine products (I have been using the technology for 35 years) and has great support BUT they are not good at being open with their product road map/retirement plans.  This is very embarrassing  to me when talking with my end user clients.


So I am looking at how to replace ZEN - this is not a short term project, at one client I have over 800 ZEN pages.

And it's such a shame as ZEN works and, most importantly, I and the team know how to make it "sing and dance".
