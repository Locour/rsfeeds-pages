closures in JavaScript.
Quick answer:
function getCounter() {
    count = 0
    return function {

}

Longer answer:
Higher Order Functions in JavaScript, which means you can create and return functions out of the functions. 
As we also know, functions can access each of their outer scopes.
function a() {
    let variable = "hello world"

First of all, we should define what do we mean by custom domain-specific languages.
In everyday programming, we have to encode real-world problems in code. We are limited by the power of expressivity of the language we are using. The programming languages are fairly low when it comes to model the real world.

Before starting to see about Strapi's Content-Types, before looking at Next.js' file and route structure, it's good to discuss Security.
A concern that usually is not followed up with due attention in certain teams, and that can cause a very high cost, when a project is put into production.
This article is another introductory article to the Next.js + Strapi stack, we will also cover TypeScript, Data Fetch, Layouts, CI / CD and Deploy, but first of all we will cover security.
