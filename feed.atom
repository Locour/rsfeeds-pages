To calculate correlation between two data sets is quite easy all you need is to make use of cor() function and insert the parameters xand y. 
What is the correlation between X and Y if y = (100,94,150,160,180), and x = (23,21,32,40,45).
y=c(100,94,150,160,180)
x =c(23,21,32,40,45)
cor(x,y)

> y=c(100,94,150,160,180)

Terraform is an incredible resource to turn any API into declarative, configurable code with Hashicorp's HCL language. However, the world is often at your fingertips when creating cloud resources with Terraform. Frequently, an HCL codebase is run through a CI/CD pipeline, and without proper checks or human involvement, a developer can destroy or change critical resources in production environments.
Insert Conftest! As they state in their GitHub description, Conftest tests against structured configuration data using the Open Policy Agent Rego query language. In the case of Terraform, this means we're actually running unit tests against sample JSON and actual tests against the Terraform state JSON.

  How do reverse shells work?


To make a connection to a typical remote shell, a machine controlled by the attacker connects to the remote network host and it requests a shell connection.

But what if the remote host is not directly accessible, like it has public IP or is protected by a firewall?
In this situation reverse shells maybe shouldn't be used, where the target machine initiates connection to the listening network host a shell is now established.
To start you need a listener process on their system to listen the reverse shell connections incoming to their IP address, Eg, 12.12.12.12

The netcat listener will listen at port 7070. An attacker needs to execute the code to the listener. Many reverse shells needs programming langs

“I’ve been dragging my feet on learning”
“I’ve started and given up 3 times”
“I don’t know where to start, afraid it will mess up my laptop”
“It’s overwhelming”
I was relieved to hear this as I also found it intimidating.
There is a lot of great free tutorials out there, but some of it feels like jumping straight into “Kubernetes 301: PhD in Containerology”.
(Kubernetes the Hard Way I’m looking at you. An amazing resource, but a very steep on-ramp for busy DevOps folks.)

One of the best things about GraphQL is that it provides an Introspection Query capability which allows users to explore and learn about what's possible in a given API. In that way, GraphQL is "self-documenting". Some great tools like Playground and Anvil's own SpectaQL leverage the Introspection Query.
Overall, the Introspection Query is a great thing, but there is one major downside: everything in your GraphQL schema will be visible to the world. Chances are your schema contains some Types, Fields, Queries, Mutations, etc, that you do not want the world to see or know about.

Python has a great feature where it first compiles your source code into bytecode; this is a low-level platform-independent representation of your source code.

You see, I am a Devops engineer.  I know what Devops means to me.  Even though they have once again given me the Devops job title; automation engineer would work just as well.  To me Devops is about a philosophy more than a job title or magic bullet.  It is important that everyone understands what role a "Devops Engineer" plays at a company.

Miguel de Icaza described .NET Core as a “redesigned version of .NET that is based on the simplified version of the class libraries.” And Microsoft’s .NET project manager, Immo Landwerth explained that .NET Core will be “the foundation of all future .NET platforms” because of its cross-platform support.
The next major release of .NET Core was .NET 5.0. This followed .NET Core 3.1. Microsoft named this release .NET 5.0 instead of .NET Core 4.0 for two reasons. Firstly, it was to avoid confusion with the .NET Framework 4.x. Secondly, it was to emphasize that this is the immediate implementation of .NET. Hence, “Core” was dropped from the name.

forEach()


Do not use an async callback with forEach(). In general, the way to simulate forEach() with async functions is to use await Promise.all([arr.map(callback)])
const values = [10, 50, 100];

// Do this:
await Promise.all(values.map(async v => {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, v));
  console.log('Slept for', v, 'ms');
}));

// Not this:
values.forEach(async v => {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, v));
  console.log('Slept for', v, 'ms');
});

return await


Async/await works with try/catch... almost. There's a gotcha. If you await on a promise that rejects, JavaScript throws an error that you can catch. But if you…]]></summary>

For purposes of brevity, wherever I refer to *ngIf it is equally applicable to *ngFor. The complete, working code can be downloaded here.
Let’s start with the default application generated by the CLI and just modify the nice Angular logo in and out of the view based on a button we add.

You won’t need routing and can select SCSS for the styling.

In JavaScript, you reassign any type to any variable, or even access attributes that do not exist. Not with TypeScript since TypeScript checks types, ensuring only a value of the correct type to a variable or that attributes from an object actually exist.
For example, let’s take the following code.
let foo: number = 42;
foo = "bli";

This code assigns a string to a variable that can only contain numbers and, therefore, will raise the following error at compile-time, as shown below.

The average person has to keep track of approximately 100 passwords and spends almost 13 minutes every week resetting those passwords. Due to this friction, password reuse is a major issue with over two-thirds of end users reusing passwords across sites, creating widespread security vulnerabilities. The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) found that credential vulnerabilities are involved in more than 80% of all data breaches. Since password reuse is so common, a single compromised password can endanger multiple accounts. 
Auth0 was the first IAM system to build support for passwordless authentication, and all of these reasons are as pertinent as ever:
Passwords are insecure: users pick insecure passwords and reuse them across sites. Since data breaches are common and they frequently include password information, this creates a situation where more and more sites are vulnerable to hacking attempts.
Passwords are expensive to manage: users forget them, and resetting passwords can be an expensive and time-consuming process.
Passwords negatively impact customer retention: remembering and typing a password, particularly on a phone keyboard, carries friction, and can cause returning customers to abandon the login flow, therefore impacting retention.
We believe that moving away from passwords as an authentication method is key to making the internet safer while reducing friction and positively impacting user acquisition and retention. 
Since our initial release, the authentication industry has been hard at work finding better ways to implement passwordless authentication. For example, the FIDO Alliance successfully led the specification and implementation of WebAuthn. In the last few years, Webauthn has been implemented in all major OS/browsers, with iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 being the latest to join the party in September 2020.

Before we get into the understanding of event loop. It's ideal to understand how call stack works. (will make another blog on call stack or please refer to another blog on call stack). 
Any process that is async goes into the call stack. It is directly thrown into the event loop and new call stack is formed to call the next process. 
What happens in the event loop?
The event loop is something that is at core done by c++ and c to do the non-blocking I/O operations that couldn't be done with vanilla JS. 
It would be easier to understand doing it with an example. 
Let's take the most basic function of asynchronous call which is setTimeout().
Step 1: 

Step 2: Since setTimeout is an async call it gets put in the event loop immediately. 

Step 3: Now the call stack looks for the next process while the setTimeout() process is happening in the event loop. This is what they call async programming. Doing multiple tasks at the same time. 
Once the process in the event loop is done. It goes to the event queue so that the call stack can pick it up once there are no more processes left for the call stack to read. 

Once no more processes are left for the call stack, the event queue then pushes the call backs to the call stack so that the script can finally end.]]></summary>

A queue can be implemented using an array or a linked list, can be either fixed or dynamic size.
Add - Add an item to the end of the queue, also called enqueue.
Remove - Remove the first item from the queue, also called dequeue.
Peek - Return the top of the queue, without removing it.
isEmpty - Return true if the queue is empty.
isFull - Return true if the stack is full, used when the queue is fixed size.
Here's an implementation of a queue using an array, in TypeScript an array doesn't have a fixed length, so the operation isFull is not required, however, you can implement a queue with a fixed length and use that operation.
class Queue<T> {
  private array: T[] = [];

class-transformer depends on the reflect-metadata package. Read this blogpost to know why you should be careful with depending on this package.
io-ts requires knowledge of some functional programming concepts. While I'm a big fan of functional programming, it's not for everyone. (The library is very well designed though)
In both cases we also need to depend on an extra package.
We want to keep our dependencies as small as possible.
What none of these packages offer is a way to deal with backwards compa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Angular is a framework, while React and Vue are libraries, therefore angular is heavier than the other two, due to its big codebase. The Angular’s core contains most of the functionalities you might need in your application, while with React and Vue, you have to find external libraries, maintained by independent contributors. Therefore, when working with React and Vue, you have to be more careful when choosing libraries, being aware that libraries with a poor maintenance might be deprecated in future.
To build an app with Angular you have to learn Typescript, which is a superset of JavaScript, while with Vue and React you can use pure JS. Regarding the view, with Angular and Vue you write it with HTML, where in React you have to write JSX, which is a syntax that allows coexistence between …]]></summary>

Vue 3 is getting popular. We like Composition API, it really helps you to keep your code clean and composable. The component's api became more predictable. Making components, we also used new features as Teleports, plural v-model and others.

Types included, you can build your components with clear predictions. (p.s. I couldn't imagine how useful Typescript can be, before I try.)

We build components with Vite (rollup.js inside), with treeshake and separate css files, so you can use a few components only and take care about your bundle size. (but no so fast).




Added simple animations for dropdowns 




The library is under development, so if you find a bug feel free to make an issue in our repo Qui-max]]></summary>

So, what are template literal types?
In order to understand what template literal types are, we first need to have a brief look at literal types. Literal types allow us to define types that are more specific, instead of something that is generalized like string or number. 
Let's say you have a switch; it can have the value of either on or off. One way of defining the types of this, is to use literal types, giving it the type of either On or Off:
type Switch = "On" | "Off"

In the case above, the value of any variable of type Switch can only be On or Off:
const x: Switch = "On"
const y: Switch = "Off"

Their example loads markdown files from a folder in the root directory and uses remark and gray-matter to convert the markdown into html and to get file metadata. The example code for these function is located in their lib folder as api.ts and markdownToHtml.ts. 
The system they used works very well, however, if you plan on creating many posts and incorporating many images then that is when the system begins to breakdown. Since you store all of the markdown files and images in your root directory then it will perpetually grow and hosting costs for packages that large are affected.

Keymapping or Key binding is a process in which a user or a system can assign certain keys or commands to perform a particular task or commands.

In Vim this can be a great power to have for programmers as it can be really very flexible to set up for any programming language and it's environment.
This is not a in-depth guide of Vim-keymappings, it is just a overview of how to make keymappings and make the workflow a bit easier, probably give some insights on the strength of Vim to easily integrate with terminal and perform tasks with shortcuts.
