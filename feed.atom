O objetivo principal da linguagem Terraform é declarar recursos , que representam objetos de infraestrutura. Todos os outros recursos de linguagem existem apenas para tornar a definição de recursos mais flexível e conveniente.
Os blocos são contêineres para outro conteúdo e geralmente representam a configuração de algum tipo de objeto, como um recurso. Os blocos têm um tipo de bloco, podem ter zero ou mais rótulos e ter um corpo que contém qualquer número de argumentos e blocos aninhados. A maioria dos recursos do Terraform é controlada por blocos de nível superior em um arquivo de configuração. Em outras palavras o Terraform trabalha com encapsulamento e instancias de objetos.
Beleza, nada melhor do que um Hello World para começar uma nova linguagem né?
No terraform o resultado de uma execução e tratado como uma saida da propria execução.
Para definir uma saída, você abre um bloco de saída usando a palavra chave output. Você então começa o bloco output com {. Você só tem permissão para definir uma única propriedade chamada value. Qualquer valor que você der à propriedade value será enviado ao console após um sucesso terraform apply. Você então fecha o bloco de saída com }.
output "message" {
    value = "Hello World"

A saida será essa:

A template engine is software designed to combine templates with a data model to produce multiple pages that share the same look throughout the site. These are the views in an MVC project.
So this helps us in putting dynamic content on our HTML pages. 
We got a HTML like template (technically not HTML) which is typically a file that contains a lot of HTML like content in it but with some placeholders plugged into it and then we have a server (a Node.js Express server or any other server) serving the Node/…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Angular, we use HTTP to get data from backend,HTTP methods always return an observable.Generally we subscribe to that observable and assign response data to class variables to use it in our component.
But using RxJS operators we can compose multiple observables(data streams) or process  observable data  before subscribing to it.
RxJS concatMap operator
Observable emits observable).
concatMap operator
Takes each value from the outer observable and maps that value  to observable(called as inner observable) 
Concat all inner observables into a single observable in order  and subscribe to inner observables and emit data of each inner observable into output observable in sequential manner.
concatMap never subscribes to the next inner observable until the previous one completes.
Example:

Run live
Here we have 2 API’s
In the above case we need to take all roll numbers from the first API  and pass it to the second API.

So solution to this problem is use concatMap RxJS operator instead of nested subscription.

First contactMap operator -
getToppers_rollNum() this method returns an Observable of type number[] , conactMap  maps Observable<number[]> to Observable <number>(inner observable) then subscribes to inner observable and emit data into output observable(top_3_rollNum$).
Second  concatMap operator -
top_3_rollNum$ as outer observable.concatMap takes each roll number from the outer observable and hits http request sequentially(here we have 3 inner observables return by 3 http requests) & emits http response data into output observable(topper_marks$).
concatMap never hits the next http request until the previous one completes.
Shorthand syntax for above code

So,concatMap is used where sequence of execution matters.

Let's dive into it.
Node.js is a single-threaded, asynchronous, event-driven runtime environment for running Javascript code on the server.
By Single-threaded means Javascript runtime executes only one piece of code( or statement) at any instance of time synchronously. It has only one call stack and one heap memory. But then how does runtime handles multiple asynchronous operations in an efficient way ? Node.js handles it efficiently using its event-driven approach. Don't worry about that now. We will come back to it soon :) .

This article outlines the first step which is to establish a way for a DevOps to authenticate and access a Power Platform environment
DevOps uses Service Connections to authenticate against environments and you really have two types. You could create a Service Connection that just uses a standard user account or you could use a Service Principal.
With a user account, this will be treated like a normal user - so there may be license implications and is generally not the recommended method. With just a tiny bit of effort we can use Service Principals and therefore this is what I'll be demonstrating with.

To convert an entire object to a read-only or a constant object, you can use the as keyword after the object initialization followed by the keyword const in TypeScript.
// using "as" keyword after the person
// object initialisation followed by the keyword "const"
// to make the object readonly or a constant object
const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
} as const;

// change the "name" property value
person.name = "Hello"; // ❌ not allowed. Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.

For example, let' say we have an object called person with 2 properties called name and age having values of John Doe and 23 respectively like this,
// a simple object
const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,

This application would be used for the time efficient human being, college student, or working class. It really would be used by anyone universally. If you believe time is money, this application is for you.

Behind the scenes, this extra safeguard is made possible by storing backups using a Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) model. 
The main reason to rehash this? Unique features like this seem to stay under the radar way too often. Secondly, if you already use AWS Backup, then enabling this extra protection is almost effortless.
Here's an example of AWS Backup Vault using Locks in CloudFormation:

This was the first I had worked on any kind of GraphiQL implementation, so for those of you at the point I was at then, GraphiQL is an Open Source project that can be used to interact with a GraphQL API in an ad-hoc and dynamic way, allowing a developer to iterate quickly on features from a data retrieval standpoint.

You know all about phishing. From time to time, emails purporting to be from Facebook or your bank drift into your inbox and insist you “verify your account.” Look closer and you spot the telltale signs of a scam: a sketchy-looking sender address, sloppy writing, and a complete lack of personalization. You sigh and hit delete.
It’s easy to be cynical about opportunistic, mass-mailed phishing attempts. Although some look genuine to even the most cautious eye, others feel decidedly amateurish and are readily identifiable. Billions of emails are sent each month, with over 245,000 phishing-related websites created in January alone according to the Anti-Phish…]]></summary>

alert("Click to continue");
console.timeLog("answer time");
alert("Do a bunch of other stuff...");

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article we are going to talk about the differences between Javascript and Typescript, they are two languages that are widely use nowadays in all types of projects, JS was the first to be introduced as client-side language. As time passed the projects were JS was being used started to be too complex and heavy, thats were TS enters the game, and starts as language to resolve all the problems that JS was having at the moment, nowadays TS is a language widely used also and is becoming bigger and bigger, so I hope that with this article I can help you a little bit to now any differences or to resolve any doubts.

There are many differences, now I'm going to show you a comprehensible list of differences.
JS is used for client-side mostly while TS is used mostly for both client-side and server-side.
TS has an improved readability, since JS requires a lot of manual detection of bugs and errors, this has been improved a lot by TS.
TS has static typing while JS doesn't support it since JS is a dynamically-typed language.
TS supports ES6.
TS has a full support in modern IDE.
TS can also convert its code to JS if necessary.
Using TS means that you can use OOP(Object-oriented programming) principles.
In JS functions are considered an object and they can have its own method and properties.
The choice is up to you at the end on what to choose if you want to work with this languages, you will have to balance the pros and the cons between both of them, and make an educated choice. Usually the option you choose will come from different variables like having in mind the size and complexity of the project you are going to work on, there are more differences between this two languages but the ones I wrote are the main ones and the important ones, I hope you like the article, any queries feel free to comment and ask!]]></summary>

In short, Typescript allows you to write maintainable code. Javascript works well for prototyping but becomes frustrating when you return to a project again. Suddenly, you see blocks of code where you can't understand what kind of data passes there.
In this article, I want to introduce you to Typescript while playing with code. Thus, you see it in action and don't overflow with an unnecessary theory. I recommend playing with the code you'll meet here in Typescript Playground.

Role-Based Access Control, also known as RBAC, is one of the most common strategies to restrict access to protected resources within an organization. It simplifies permission assignment by categorizing users in roles. However, many people making their first foray into RBAC have questions:
How can you reflect this user categorization on your application to check users' privileges?
How can you deal with roles in your code?
Is role control appropriate for Web APIs?
In this article, you will learn the best way to implement RBAC in your ASP.NET Core Web API by using Auth0's capabilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okta (Auth0) was placed into the Leader Quadrant for 2021, parent company Okta also named a Leader.



  
  
  
We are proud to announce that Auth0, a product unit within Okta, has been recognized as a Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management, Worldwide. Gartner defines the Access Management market as: "The access management (AM) market is defined by customers’ needs to establish, enforce, and manage run-time access controls for internal and external types of identities, as well as machine identities, interacting with cloud, modern standards-based web and legacy web applications" Auth0 focuses on SaaS-delivered developer-centric and Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) use cases.
For more information, please download the full 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management report.

The Magic Quadrant recognized Okta (Auth0) as a Leader based on our Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision.  
Auth0 believes that CIAM should do more to balance the three forces of security, privacy and convenience — not just keeping the bad actors out, but also driving customer loyalty and conversion and revenue to create a great experience for our customers, partners, and their end-users.
We believe vendors' experience in the space is a key consideration for Gartner in their Magic Quadrant Evaluations. As stated by one of our customers in their review of Auth0, included in the 2021 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer Access Management Report, Auth0 comes with great features out-of-the-box. We went live easily with Auth0 as our Identity Provider. The platform/vendor does not just support us in a technical angle, but also understanding our user journey and sharing their experience (with other clients) and what approaches to take to minimize risk and even enhance user experience during the migration. — VP, Core Product Development, Retail industry

Linux is one of the most popular operating systems in the world. It is Unix-like, and it is also open-source. Quite a big percentage of developers use Linux because it can be customized in so many ways.
What's cool about Linux is its command line. Every 'hackers' paradise. There are a ton of commands. If you aren't familiar with any Linux commands, be sure to check out this post on the 8 Linux Commands Everyone Should Know.
There is probably a command for almost anything that you want to do. For example what if you wanted to get the size of a directory? Well luckily for you there is a command for that. In this post, we are going to talk about that command and see what it can offer.

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js is a popular, lightweight web framework for beginners, and it is used by many big companies like Netflix and Uber.

 Everyone has widespread access to windows but they may or maynot be savvy enough to run their favorite flavour of linux due to various constraints
WSL2 really makes life easy for those devs who can't access linux through a cloud provider or locally run it on their devices.
WSL has support for various distros like Debian, Arch and Ubuntu.
Now coming to the interesting part, windows has all access to the CPU and memory resources in your device and it is built in a way which will optimize the resource utilization but how do you limit your linux subsystem, let  us say you'd like to manipulate the configuration to suit your needs the best, then you should follow these steps.
Shut your current running instance of WSL using this command
wsl --shutdown

Run this command through powershell as administrator
Create a configuration file for WSL on your user profile directory
notepad "$env:USERPROFILE\.wslconfig"

 This is the most important step in this project, so please follow carefully 
The following parameters define their corresponding resources:
CPU  = > cores dedicated to WSL
Memory  = > RAM allocated to WSL
AutoMount  = > Mount your default NTFS drive to your subsystem
Boot => defines your booting options for services
Kernel  = > Custom kernel for linux
LocalhostForwarding  = > for port-forwarding your applications running on localhost
My configuration for CPU and memory:
[wsl2]
memory=9GB  
processors=4

This is how you can configure your resources for WSL 😀. Feel free to leave some comments down below⬇️.
