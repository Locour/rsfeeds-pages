This guide aims to do that for 2021, with the best in class tooling at this time. That said when using modern advanced tooling, you can and will run into some compatibility problems so this guide might be slightly esoteric for you.
This guide is really optimized towards typescript monorepos that also contain packages that can be deployed but really should work for any typescript monorepos.
For this guide, we will be using pnpm but this should mostly work the space with yarn just swap out pnpm workspaces with yarn workspaces. (This will likely not work well with npm and …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's a ton of HTML multi-step form examples out there: see https://csshint.com/multi-step-html-forms/ for instance. So why create another one? Simply put, I couldn't find a form that satisfied my two main requirements:
1) Responsive. The form should look good on a phone, a desktop, and everything in between. It's 2021 and most web traffic now goes  through mobile devices, so making your pages responsive should be a top priority.
I was also looking for the following:
Here's what I came up with:




The labels will disappear when there isn't enough horizontal space for them, but the form isn't smart enough to figure out the perfect breakpoint on its own: you'll have to manually specify that value in multi-step-nav.css. 
Why add next and previous buttons in each step instead of reusing the same buttons everywhere? Doing it like this actually helps with the tabbing behavior: if you've tabbed to a next/previous button and press Enter, tabbing again will move you to the top of the new section, instead of tabbing out of the form towards the bottom of the document.
There's one accessibility feature I couldn't seem to figure out, however. When using NVDA (the most popular desktop screen reader according to the latest WebAIM survey) in browse mode, using the down arrow after pressing the Next or Previous button won't start reading at the top of the newly selected section. Anyone out there know how to fix this? 🙂

Nmr (Node module resolver) is a command line utility that stores npm modules in a safe place and prevetn your from installing the same module for different projects again and again.
nmr is aimed for reducing the space hogged by the node_modules folder in ever node.js project.
To install nmr, enter the following command in the terminal:
npm install -g @svel-ai/nmr@latest

To use nmr you have to install package globally, and then add them to your project.
For example, if you want to use the commander module in your project, you will have to install the commander module to your system through the following command:
nmr install commander

The above command can be run form anywhere in the terminal.
To use the module in your project, run the following command inside of your project directory:
npm init -y
nmr add commander

That's it. Your ready to use commander. You can use it in your project and import it normally
const { program } = require("commander");
// import { program } from "commander" // If you are using ES6 syntax
// ...

As AWS Amplify has a fully integration with HUGO framework, the build and deploy process is almost automatic, it is very easy, its only need to specify github's branch, give the right permissions and set the DNS properly. So on, the deploy is done.
First all, you’ll need to create a S3 bucket. To host a static web site in S3 and use custom domain, the buckets name need to be the same of your custom domain, so I created two buckets according image bellow:

on reddit, there are many voices arguing that the tsc is enough (1, 2)

Besides, TypeScript folks themselves state that "TypeScript code is transformed into JavaScript code via the TypeScript compiler or Babel" (1), or that "You might use [babel] for speed or consistency with your existing build tooling"(2).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article we are going to learn how to configure multiple environments in a single React application. For example, you might want your dev environment connected to your dev API Endpoint, QA to QA endpoint and production to a production endpoint. We could solve this by using a single .env file but, each time you push your code to specific environments you need to remember to change the endpoint values, which is a slight headache and can be error prone. Let’s see how we can solve this!
 
First, get the package env-cmd from npm by running
npm install — save-dev env-cmd
Next, create your environment specific .env files. In this example, I’ve created a folder named “environments” in my root directory (same level as package.json). Important the environment variables MUST start with REACT_APP_ . Read more here.
REACT_APP_API_END_POINT==http://my-dev-url.com

Please note .dev.env, .qa.env and .prod.env are three separate files in the environments folder. See below

Next, update the package.json . Update the scripts portion of your package.json to include the following:
“scripts”: {


Next start your local/dev react application by running
npm run start:dev
You can test your env variable in your app by doing the following
console.log(process.env.REACT_APP_API_END_POINT);
For QA and Production build replace the command npm run build to the newly added environment specific command npm run build:qa or npm run build:prod respectively. (For example, if you are on AWS, edit the buildspec on Codebuild and replace npm run build with npm run build:qa or npm run build:prod)

We are excited to host Brett Mitchell, who is a Principal Architect / Cloud Customer Engineer at Google, for this interactive livestream on June 8th. Brett will discuss DevOps best practices, and demonstrate how to deploy HarperDB on the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Google Anthos platform. The demo will include creation of regional clusters around the globe, deployment of HarperDB as an Anthos managed K8s workload, and mapping service egress to Google’s Global load balancer.
June 8th @ 6:00 PM MT (event will be recorded in case you can't attend live) 
RSVP Here!
All are welcome, free virtual event 
The livestream will be followed by Q&A with Brett and the HarperDB team, so bring your questions. 

Before joining Google, he spent 5+ years in the technology consulting space with industry leaders KPMG and Slalom.  He spent the majority of his career as a CTO, founding and cultivating start-ups in the telco/broadband, logistics, media, and fin-tech sectors.
Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management. It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
Anthos is a managed application platform that extends Google Cloud services and engineering practices to your environments so you can modernize apps faster and establish operational consistency across them.
HarperDB is a geo-distributed database that enables speed, performance, and low latency. With SQL on JSON, you no longer have to pick a database based on the structure of your data. HarperDB runs anywhere and ingests any type of data at scale. Accessed via an intuitive REST API, you can perform all CRUD database operations using one single endpoint.
Let's get coding!]]></summary>

Even though most of our users deliver software to us as Docker containers, we don’t use Docker to run them. Docker is great, but we’re high-density multitenant, and despite strides, Docker’s isolation isn’t strong enough for that. So, instead, we transmogrify container images into Firecracker micro-VMs.

If you have ever worked with Node.Js, you must have used a package called nodemon for development. 
For those who are not aware of it, nodemon is a tool that helps develop NodeJs based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. We can simply install it globally and use it throughout our system without making any additional changes to the code.
But, have you ever thought about how it works internally? How would you proceed if you are asked to build a nodemon clone?

I thought of discussing azure signalr using terraform in this part, but today I found a very interesting things from azure signalr authentication which is not yet officially documented by Microsoft. So, I'm going to discuss that in this part. 
Now a days its common and best practice to use managed identity as much as you can to avoid using the keys/connection string/password in your application or event vault. So, I also would want to use managed identity for authentication from my azure app service to the Azure SignalR resource. This has been explained so well at here

So I thought it would be super simple to implement this in my POC until I hit one road block, let’s see what is the problem and how can we solve that.

1- Once logged in, click on
New site from Git

2- Choose where your code is stored:

3- Choose your repository (GitHub):

4- He will ask to set up your build information inBase directory you must put the path to your main page,, Build command this is where you put the command that will generate your project build, I always put it CI= npm run build
CI = <b>CI</b> means continuous integration

5- If everything is ok, it will show this page saying that your application was successfully uploaded.

6- Click Add custom domain to place a domain you have purchased or click Edit site name to change only the Netlify domain name:

And voila, your application is already online and 100% free.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to present you a simple script which I wrote when I needed to merge the passwords database from LastPass to my current KeepassXC database.

Let's start with my example, you want to migrate from LastPass but you already have existing passwords in Keepass.
That's why I wrote this script which will merge multiple databases exported in CSV and remove duplikats automatically.
ProHint: If you are esporting a database from LastPass (or other services), add the exported CSV first to the new Keepass database and set the columns you have on your other Keepass database and export as new CSV file. This will make sure you have the same columns in the current database and the new one.
My columns look like this: 
Group | Title | Username | Password | URL | Notes
To install and start the CSV database merge you can easily install from npmjs.com
$ npm install merge-csv-keepass -g
or
$ yarn global add merge-csv-keepass

It is very easy to use, after installation you have access to a new command merge-csv-keepass where you just need to add few arguments and you are done!
Example, we have a database db1.csv and db2.csv we want to merge them into a file merged_db.csv to do this we run the command:
merge-csv-keepass -source db1.csv db2.csv -output merged_db.csv

Done! Simple, isn't it?
Keep in mind that the script does not check if the output file exists! If it exists it will overwrite it!
Of course you can add more databases than just two to merge, or even just one database to only remove duplikats from it.
The whole project is open source and available on Github.

As for source data, I had two choices, read the blog posts from already generated HTML files or prepare JSON data with all blog posts at the build time. I chose the second one because the first one seems a little bit clunky and problematic. There could be many different edge cases when collecting the data.

You can generate music, analyze audio using machine learning, build audio visualizers, music information retrieval systems, and much more. It's an extremely fun field. But working with audio can be tricky - how is sound represented on a computer? How can we manipulate that sound? And how do we serialize sound data to disk?
This post won't be a deep dive into audio encoding - it's a practical guide for how to load audio in Node JS, into a state that you can work with it. Generally, digital signal processing (which means "working with audio data using code") operates on a kind of audio data called Pulse Code Modulation. There's a lot of fancy theory and maths behind PCM encoding - but until you're ready to …]]></summary>

It isn't a full-on victory everywhere, I know places where people have more of a "they're kids toys" mentality and stay in 100% class + hookless function components, but in general I guess we can agree hooks have been a success.
There are a lot of posts on why hooks are great already, but I want to focus a bit more on nuances that might help you decide when to use classes, and when hooks are the better fit.
You can add context to class components, but the syntax can be a bit awkward especially if you're also using TypeScript and want to get the goodies:
class YourComponent extends React.PureComponent {
  static contextType = YourContext;
  context: React.ContextType<typeof YourContext>;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[function chunkArrayInGroups(arr, size) {
  return arr;
}

chunkArrayInGroups(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2);

Answer:




function chunkArrayInGroups(arr, size) {
  let newArr = [];

  while (arr.length) {
    newArr.push(arr.splice(0, size));
  }

  return newArr;
}

console.log(chunkArrayInGroups(["a", "b", "c", "d"], 2)); // will display [["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]]

Firstly, we create a variable. newArr is an empty array which we will push to.
Our while loop loops until we dont have a length of the array.
Inside our loop, we push to the newArr array using arr.splice(0, size).
For each iteration of while loop, size tells the array how many we want to either add or remove .
Finally, we return the value of newArr.
function chunkArrayInGroups(arr, size) {
  let newArr = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i += size) {
    newArr.push(arr.slice(i, i + size));
  }
  return newArr;
}

First, we create an empty array newArr where we will store the groups.
The for loop starts at zero, increments by size each time through the loop, and stops when it reaches arr.length.
Note that this for loop does not loop through arr. Instead, we are using the loop to generate numbers we can use as indices to slice the array in the right locations.
Inside our loop, we create each group using arr.slice(i, i+size), and add this value to newArr with newArr.push().
Finally, we return the value of newArr.]]></summary>

mutation(["hello", "hey"]);

For example, ["hello", "Hello"], should return true because all of the letters in the second string are present in the first, ignoring case.
The arguments ["hello", "hey"] should return false because the string hello does not contain a y.
If everything is lowercase it will be easier to compare.
Our strings might be easier to work with if they were arrays of characters.
A loop might help. Use indexOf() to check if the letter of the second word is on the first.


Answer:




function mutation(arr) {
   let firstWord = arr[0].toLowerCase();
   let secondWord = arr[1].toLowerCase();

   for (let i = 0; i < secondWord.length; i++) {
    let letters = secondWord[i];

  Intro 


Continuing on from my previous blog about website security week, we're going to talk about a CORS on the web.
CORS is Cross-origin Resource Sharing this is often used when your website is hosted separately from your API. e.g. your website is at website.com and calls your API at api.com.



To allow CORS requests your API will need to response with certain headers, which allow certain behaviors from your website/frontend.
This header can be set with either the origin which will be calling the API, it can only be a single origin.
* however this doesn't allow credentials to be passed, which we will talk about later.
If at all possible prefer setting a specific origin to a *.

Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.
What is GUI ?
The graphical user interface is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.
Lets Directly Jump to Practicles : 
Docker Engine Must be Installed in the Base OS / Host .
To confirm whether docker is installed or not we can use :
Docker Engine must be in running state .
[root@os]~# systemctl status docker

We must have a docker image to execute our task .
[root@os]~# docker pull centos:latest
We will now create a Dockerfile in which we will specify our Requirements for our own custom Image
[root@os]~# vim Dockerfile 
FROM centos:latest

[root@os]~# docker build -t firefox:v1 .

docker build will help us to make our own customized image with tag firefox:v1

[root@os]~# docker run -it --name task2 -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --net=host firefox:v1

$DISPLAY == Enivornment Variable for our Display :0 is the main display.
[root@os]~# firefox

[root@os]~# jupyter notebook

In Addition to firefox i used jupyter notebook as a GUI APP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main reason for using interfaces is to achieve polymorphism and to provide developers with the ability to implement interface methods in their own way in the future.
In this example I will use TypeScript and I will put the repository at the end of the note
Suppose we have an interface and three classes:

This is the connector interface.
Now we are going to implement the Wifi communication.

Here we have developed our concrete class called WifiConnector which has its own implementation of type Connector.
Now we are creating our System which has a Connector component. This is called dependency injection.


Connector is an interface and must have the method doConnect().
Now, since Connector is an interface, the System class has much more flexibility.
We can pass any type that has implemented the Connector interface.
For example, now the developer wants to add a Bluetooth  connection module:

We see that WifiConnector and BluetoothConnector have their own implementation.
So we can pass any of them to the System class as a constructor parameter. This is called polymorphism.
The System class is now not aware of whether it is Bluetooth or Wifi. We can even add another communication module such as Infrared, Bluetooth5 and whatever, simply by implementing the Connector interface.
This is called Duck Typing. The connector type is now dynamic since doConnect() is just a placeholder and the developer implements it as their own.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Encryption is a two-way function. You can encrypt data, like a file, and then later decrypt it provided you have the proper encryption key. This is useful when you need to retrieve the original data.
Hashing, on the other hand, is a one-way function. It scrambles the input data into a unique output and you cannot reverse this process to reveal the original data.
How is a non-reversible operation useful? It's more secure for things like passwords. With encryption, the website server needs to have the encryption key to decrypt it. If the server gets hacked, the attackers could get this key and decrypt every user's password immediately.
With hashing, there is no key. Websites don't actually need to know a user's password, they just need to know that what the user enters in the password field matches what is stored in the database. They can do this by taking the password the user enters, hashing it in the same way they hashed it when the user first set it, and making sure both match. If they do, you get to log in.
If an attacker gets a list of hashed passwords, they'd have to generate a bunch of guesses, hash each one using the same algorithm, and compare the result to the hashed values one-by-one.]]></summary>

Can an Angular application store tokens in localStorage?
– Yes, of course! LocalStorage is persistent storage, so the token is available to all tabs and windows. It even survives a browser restart.
– No, absolutely not! LocalStorage is insecure, and an attacker will be able to steal the token.

This article is targeted to beginning-to-intermediate-level Angular developers wishing to obtain insight into methods for state management in front-end applications. A simple, but highly customizable, reactive state-management service is constructed on top of the RxJs BehaviorSubject. This approach can be used for both management of a global store or as model manager for a lazy-loaded route. Both use cases are illustrated through an Angular version 8 application.
While the code in this application may be extended for practical use in your own applications, there is another motivation for studying the internals of state management. Doing so provides a better understanding of the underlying details of such management, which makes you a better consumer of t…]]></summary>

It embraces the power of RxJS with composable subscriptions. Angular Composition API is designed to feel native to the Angular developer.

sudo apt install apache2-utils

htpasswd -nB adam

The n option will display the hash in stdout and the B option will use more secure encryption.
devto password's hash is shown below:
adam:$2y$05$h9OxLeY20/5uiXjfPgdRxuFlrfqBf2QifYDgrwsR6rAEgX3/dpOGq

adam:$$2y$$05$$h9OxLeY20/5uiXjfPgdRxuFlrfqBf2QifYDgrwsR6rAEgX3/dpOGq

Remember to use the escaped double $.
You may have existing rules for your HTTPS route, e.g. compressing, etc.
So create a new chain where you'll combine your existing middlewars and the newly created yoursite-basicauth.
In your docker-compose.yml file:
  labels:
    - "traefik.http.middlewares.yourservice-https-chain.chain.middlewares=yourservice-basicauth,yourservice-other-middleware-remove-or-replace-with-yours"

When I finally migrated to Linux, I started using vi/vim after using nano for a while. Unlike nano, vim is a lot more powerful but is harder to learn.
How did I go from never using vim to using it all the time? How does one make a complete switch? I'll walk you through how I got here and share some tips along the way.
If you are trying to learn Vim, or you are on the fence about it, here are my top 5 reasons why I love this keyboard-centered editor:
The more I used it, the faster I became, and the faster I became the more productive I was.


It's everywhere. Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and every other operating system supports Vi/Vim. 


I don't like to use my mouse. I never did anything in Sublime Text without the help of my mouse. This is a annoying, easier to keep hands on the keyboard


It can be used over the network using ssh. Login to any box and use it.


I use it for almost everything: programming, writing, blogging, etc.




Switching is up to you, but here are my reasons.
Why would somebody use ancient tools like vi/vim when there are so many modern ones out there? 
One day I had to answer this question for my friend. He asked, “Why don’t you use Sublime Text like me?” I explain to him that sometimes it’s better to use older/simpler tools than more complex ones.
Here are my reasons:
Learn how to use the best editor ever made.
Never get lost in a sea of menus and toolbars that you never use (just like vim does not have any).
Have an excuse to use powerful, built-in commands that are available in no other editor (and are faster than anything you can do with a GUI).
Work fast using commands

tmux may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached. 
It allows you to easily manage separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window. 
tmux can connect to a server, and multiple clients can be connected to the same session, simultaneously exchanging their input and display.

You can use these commands and shortcuts to work with tmux in Linux. From the command line:



Session Control





tmux
Start a new session


tmux new -s 
Start a new session with the name chosen


tmux ls
List all sessions






Pane Control





Ctrl b, "
Split pane horizontally


Ctrl b, %
Split pane vertically


Ctrl b, o
Next pane



I've used tmux for years, and it has become an essential part of my work flow. I couldn't imagine editing code without it. If you want to practice Linux commands, you can use these exercises 
tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.
Features include:
• Splitting a terminal window into horizontal or vertical panes.

tmux is very useful for people who commonly work on remote machines via ssh.
Why did I pick tmux over screen and a terminal multiplexer? Three reasons.
First, tmux is written is responsive and light.
Second, tmux is much more expressive than screen. I can split my terminal into six panes and change the size of each pane with the same ease as resizing a terminal in GNU Screen.
Third, tmux has integrated support for a status bar. This means I can read from one pane and keep an eye on other panes at the same time.]]></summary>

One of the famous misleading opinions we observe among people especially on Twitter and youtube gurus is ‘Angular has a steep learning curve’.

For the purpose of this demo, I have already created a simple Angular 7 application that is hosted on Gitlab, the application is a simple, digital clock that looks something like this.


The above diagram describes the whole process, right from a developer pushing the code, to the point where the CI/CD Pipeline builds & deploys the code to Azure Storage (Blob) which is linked to Azure CDN Endpoint.
Developer goes ahead and performs the development locally of the application after which he goes ahead and commits and pushes the code to the version control system in our case it’s Gitlab.


We would then have Gitlab perform the CI/CD in the form of the steps mentioned in git…]]></summary>

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

This is not a breaking change as our compile target is still node 14, and node 16 is backward compatible.
