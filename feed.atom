        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If we use OnPush change detection strategy, immutability is helpful to ensure change detection works expectedly. 
One of the way to enforce immutability is using Immutable.js. However, using Immutable.js is not really straightforward. It adds another layer instead of using JS object directly e.g
const apps = List([{ name: 'slack' }, { name: 'skype' }]);
apps.get(0); // { name: 'slack' }

const app = Map({ name: 'slack' });
map.get("name"); // 'slack'

// Using Record if we want to access property directly
const AppRecord = Record({
    name: ''
});

class App extends AppRecord {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }
}

const newApp = new App({ name: 'slack' });
newApp.name; // 'slack'

We have to use get when using List and Map. Using Record could solve the issue, but if we have a very large object, using Record will be hard to maintain because we need to create each record per object and it's nested object.
Other issue is about JS compatibility because it needs to use fromJS and toJS methods to convert from and to JS object. 
I'd say that I'm not a fan of that lib and it makes things more complicated. 
Other possible approach I'm thinking of: 
readonly + ESLint immutable


Since Angular using Typescript, let's use Readonly<T>, ReadonlyArray to enforce immutability. 
Also add this no-mutation ESLint rule as extra protection https://github.com/jonaskello/eslint-plugin-functional/blob/master/docs/rules/immutable-data.md
is there any better approach? 
Thank you]]></summary>

When a bash shell is started at login it's considered interactive and expects to be attached to a TTY. When we run curl https://example.com/script.sh | bash the bash process started is non-interactive and expects no human input. We can confirm a bash process' interactivity either by looking at the process table (run ps) or by checking the builtin variable $- (the shell's starting arguments) for an 'i' character.

Any non-trivial Rails app these days needs Background Jobs and a popular framework for this is Sidekiq. Sidekiq uses Redis as a data store. This means we need to deploy 4 services to Render to run our app:

The reason for this post. I started a site that is a network for developers to seek & give advice over video chat. 
https://p-pl.com is the site
For instance, if you are an expert in React.js, you can have other people connect with you. You as an expert can also bill for your time. (Hourly rate)
Or if you're seeking advice, you can search for and request to connect with other users that are online at that given moment. If they accept the call, you are immediately brought to the video chat portal to hash out your code issues or anything else.
Once the interaction ends, each user can rate eachother based on professionality, expertise etc. Think of it almost like an uber for information.
You as a user are ranked higher in the results based on your reviews as well as the meta data your provide in your profile.
This was a 2 1/2 year project and I just want it in the right hands. I will be posting tutorials later on how to use the site, core features etc.
What I'm looking to do is build the network full of JavaScript developers so that the community is rich with support in this language. Eventually then to move on to other languages.]]></summary>

Following advices of the AWS support, (in my case) I need to set this value to 150Go to let some space for all your pods/images/deployments...
The weird thing is that I haven't seen any documentation which explain how much we need to define for each kind of EC2 instance.

Also you can monitor some values in Cloudwatch (if you have a cloudwatch agent on your cluster) to check if everything is alright, and set up some alerts to be aware if something wrong is happening.

Freelancing in tech can be both rewarding and highly demanding. You're hired to deliver and you need to come up with the goods to earn your paycheck. Your work needs to be high quality and on time if you want to keep getting hired. 
But when you're just one person, delivering a consistently high standard can be a challenge, especially when you're using the wrong tools. So today we want to tell you how we're trying to help…we've built an all in one online code editor, GitOps manager and Cloud provider.

I frequently end up with "login failed for token-identified-principal" after being connected for only a few minutes. This makes using Azure Data Studio an exercise in frustration, wondering what combination of operations will result in ADS just conking out on you until your token expires.
Azure SQL doesn't support the standard T-SQL BACKUP and RESTORE commands, so getting a copy of your database for local development is somewhat challenging. The Azure Portal requires the AAD admin credentials, not something I want to give out to developers. Enter SqlPackage, which I have started preferring to both the Azure portal and ADS. SqlPackage for Linux is available at https://aka.ms/sqlpackage-linux.
A first attempt at copying the database from Azure might look like this:
sqlpackage /a:export /scs:"Data Source=...Initial Catalog=..." /ua:true /tid:"mytenant.onmicrosoft.com"
Indeed, that's what I attempted. But UniversalAuthentication (required to authenticate with MFA) doesn't seem to work as expected on Linux. You would expect that a browser would be launched to login to the application (since MFA won't work without a browser). However, the command above doesn't work.
Looking through the SqlPackage help, I see that there is a /AccessToken option. We can manually obtain an access token and use it to authenticate. Access tokens can be obtained using the Azure CLI, using the command az account get-access token --resource https://database.windows.net/. This will return a JSON body containing (among other things) the access token to use. Copy and paste this into an environment variable ACCESS_TOKEN, and then the full sqlpackage invocation becomes:
sqlpackage /a:export /at:"$ACCESS_TOKEN" /scs:"Data Source=..." /ua:True ...]]></summary>

The DBIR examined approximately 5,250 successful security breaches, gathering data about the methodologies used. It found 35 percent of attacks incorporated a social element. Of these, the vast majority (85%) used phishing tactics.
In short: you can deploy all the technological measures you want, but unless you address the human element, an attacker can defeat your defenses with a simple phone call or email.

It's not like in sales where there are numbers and KPI's to give you an idea about if you're on track or not. With a CICD pipeline, there is no measurement of value. You can't measure how many times it passed or failed because those numbers have nothing to do with providing value.
The best way that everyone on an engineering team, including management/leadership, can see the value gained is by using Value Stream Management (VSM).

I was doing a bit of bug-hunting in an old project of mine when I found an interesting bug. Can you find it?
If you know your security or PHP this might be quite easy for you. Otherwise, it might be a good exercise.
This is the request you would make to the server:
curl --location --request POST 'https://super.secure-api.com/check-pin' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
    --data-raw '{
      "pin": <you_answer>
    }'

And this is the code for that given endpoint (/check-pin)
if($params['pin'] != $user->getPin()) {
  throw new HttpException(403, "The pin is incorrect");
}

return "The pin is correct!";

PD: This is just a demo, not real code. You should never check passwords/pins/secrets like this.
pin to be able to bypass the check?


I will release a post in a couple of days explaining the bug in detail and how to fix it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
This is a tale of an adventurous fresher on her first day at work. This is also an article on K8s, so bear with me.
An application program (app or application for short) is a computer program designed to carry out a specific task typically to be used by end users.
Containers are a form of virtualization of operating systems. They are software executable units in which application code, together with its dependencies and configurations, is packed in such a manner that it may be run on any environment.
Think of containers like the work machines/laptops that can enable employees to be independent and deliver services effectively. They are portable, enable the employee to work from home or office, and have all the resources the employee needs to complete the tasks. They are also isolated, so the employee is not influenced by what others run on their machines.
To understand how Kubernetes works, we must familiarise ourselves with images.
Images can be related to the guide or manual which one uses for getting the work machine started. Or, think of it as the blueprint for creating a work machine in the first place :).
In the coming parts, we will explore how to get started with docker images and containers.
Thanks for reading!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Historically, in monolithic architectures, logs were stored directly on bare metal or virtual machines. They never left the machine disk and the operations team would check each one for logs as needed.
This worked on long-lived machines, but machines in the cloud are ephemeral. As more companies run their services on containers and orchestrate deployments with Kubernetes, logs can no longer be stored on machines and implementing a log management strategy is of the utmost importance.
Logs are an effective way of debugging and monitoring your applications, and they need to be stored on a separate backend where they can be queried and analyzed in case of pod or node failures. These separate backends include systems like Elasticsearch, GCP’s Stackdriver, and AWS’ Cloudwatch.

This is not the first time something like this happens, but I wouldn't blame NPM for this. I wouldn't even blame the Node.js community or the creator of such a popular library.
On October 22nd the owner of the UA-Parser.js package realized his NPM account had been hijacked and that someone else (the attacker) had pushed 3 different new versions (0.7.29, 0.8.0 and 1.0.0) of his package including, within it, malicious code for both Linux and Windows.
And while the effect of the attack is important and it probably did a lot of damage while it was active, that's not my focus today.

Jenkins supports this use-case by means of parameters that you can declare and use as Groovy variables in your Jenkins job. However, often you are not aware of all the parameters in the beginning or sometimes you want to render the parameters dynamically based on the value selected in any other parameter. Given the declarative nature of Jenkins jobs, we cannot achieve the use-case with the native Jenkins parameters available. Here comes the Active Choices parameter plugin to the rescue, which can help us render parameters/parameter’s value dynamically.

Then a beginner coder like me will think "to connect HTML file to css file (i.e. make the html wear the css style), we will have to set href of the link tag like this..."
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../public/style.css">

Yeah, obviously! Public folder is one folder up so '..' is so obvious!

Lots of developers use Linux, but "Linux" is a vast category.  There are a lot of similarities, but a lot of differences, too.  Ubuntu and Fedora look and feel pretty similar until you try to install a package - whoops, apt is a little different than dnf. Specific system settings may be stored in different places, and particular commands may be included by default in one but not the other.  Then there's even more niche stuff like Arch, which you install piece by piece from a very minimal package set, or Gentoo, which is similar to Arch with the additional caveat that the user compiles all the software locally for their specific hardware.  Users of these distros may end up with pretty different-looking operating systems that all fall under the broad Linux umbrella.

My first attempt was to use an interceptor service that contained a BehaviorSubject (Observable). I set it up to maintain a counter and set the observable's value to true if there were more than zero (0) requests in-flight.
Through heavy use of the console.log functionality, I came to realize that the interceptor was not always active, even though I was following proper singleton patterns.
The second attempt went more smoothly.
I had a second service (a handler) that maintained the counts and the BehaviorSubject. This one worked "like a charm."

Gating your content can be something of a gamble. On the one hand, allowing users to prematurely access your product means that you might wind up serving a lot of users who you never truly monetize. On the other hand, putting a login wall between potential users and content could lead to slower growth and a smaller user base.
According to Blue Research, 54% of users will abandon a website if the registration process is too cumbersome. Good product designers know all too well that interrupting a user in their intended path can be a great way to lose them.
Over and over again, the data shows that the more cumbersome a signup process is, the less likely a user is to bother…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An API exposes valuable data to be used by programs. REST is a standardized client-server architecture for APIs where resources are available at specific URLs. The client can query them (GET) and even write, modify and delete entries when specific endpoints exist.
GraphQL is a new approach. In most configurations, you will use one endpoint only to combine multiple queries in a single request.
It has many advantages over REST that can make sense, but it might raise security issues as well:
the default /graphql endpoint URL is quite often used in production, so it is an easy target
the introspection feature is sometimes left enabled on production, which can lead to non-public information disclosure
self-inflicted DDOS (distributed denial-of-service) are not uncommon because GraphQL queries can be significantly larger than REST queries (e.g., 10000 users and 70 posts per user makes 700 000 nodes to retrieve)
GraphQL schema design can be quite challenging, leading to expose more information than intended
string injections are not uncommon as queries are usually wrapped in JSON
everything connects to everything else, sometimes leading to authorization bypass when checks are not performed for each node
However, there are measures you can take:
don't use the default endpoint /graphql
force SSL everywhere
use standardized authentication such as JWTs or OAuth
limit GraphQL operations to authenticated requests, as you're not a public platform such as GitHub
limit query depth and add pagination
use static queries and avoid dynamically generated queries at runtime when it's possible
disable logging, debugging and exploration tools on production (including GraphiQL), not only for security reasons but also for performance
Read the OWASP cheat sheet for more details.

But how can you make sure your GraphQL queries are safe from nasties? Let’s find out.
To inspect your schema in Contentful’s GraphiQL interface and construct a GraphQL query, enter this URL in your browser, and swap out the SPACE_ID for your Contentful space ID, and ACCESS_TOKEN for your Contentful Delivery API Key.

Some time ago, I challenged myself to build a robust backend solution in JavaScript. Many developers believe that JavaScript isn't secure enough, efficient or simply organized to manage data through APIs. I'll convince you otherwise....
For this new project, I chose technologies that are on the rise, in particular PostgreSQL but especially NestJS. So, I gave up my good old database that is MongoDB, in favor of a more traditional database.
NB: I was a little bit rusty at first, but going back to relational database was a real good idea; if only to retrieve data from several tables in one call, unlike NoSQL which requires as many calls as there are documents to query... Finally, SQL is like riding a bike, it's unforgettable 😉

But what about solutions what will get to us good developer productivity like ORM, and will get a flexible API to interact with the database like pure SQL code.
If you have encountered such situations, then this post is for you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Privacy and transparency are some of the most important requirements that most modern social networks like Facebook and Instagram do not meet. 
One of the best examples of privacy nightmare is TikTok. It collects some very troubling data points such as the number of CPUs your device has, available disk space, your IP & MAC addresses, whether your phone is jailbroken, and so much more, which does not have anything to do with TikTok. Imagine that there are so many more applications and websites that do essentially the same thing and sell your information to 3rd party advertisers. Internet is rapidly becoming a place where one company can easily predict what type of person you are, based on all data points that they collected over time.
To end this, I have open-sourced the social network that I was working on for more than a year! It is called Polygon and the main goal for it is to be a social network that is not hungry for your data. Both the core and front-end are written in TypeScript and are seeking support from the open-source community. We also have a hosting guide that is written in Python.There is also some tooling written in Go. My main goal is to make it a private, easy-to-use, and crisp social network which will be adapted by privacy and open-source enthusiasts all over the world. 
Polygon is also open for Hacktoberfest contributions, which means that both beginners and professionals can contribute to the project and learn something new!
You can find all projects related to Polygon at: https://github.com/polygon-isecure

Install ADB as instructed here: https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/
Open the Windows Subsystem for Linux app and enable developer mode. An IP address and port will be shown, use this to execute the ADB command:
adb connect <IP address:PORT>
Now simply open Windows PowerShell or CMD and type
adb install "<path to APK file>"
That's it, and your APK will be installed, all you need to do now is open Start and find your installed app in the list!
NOTE: Make sure WSA is running. To run WSA open the app and select open "File".]]></summary>

We already know how to do this with jest, but while it is pretty convenient and quite easy to set up, it's also considerably slow and somewhat opinionated. Unlike more lightweight test runners, it also has a built-in code transformation API, a jsdom-based DOM environment and chooses browser conditional exports by default.
So what we need to run our tests without jest is:
Code transformation
DOM environment
Choosing browser exports
To save even more of your precious time, I already did all this work for you. You just need to install

Encryption transforms readable plaintext into unreadable ciphertext that only the intended users can understand. This prevents attackers from making sense of the data even if they get access to it. The intended users will be aware of how to convert the ciphertext into plaintext, a process known as decryption.
A simple encryption example is, say alphabet A -> 1, B -> 2, C -> 3, so on.. So the word CAB would be 321. The receiver will convert the 321 back to plain text by mapping the numbers to alphabets -> CAB.
