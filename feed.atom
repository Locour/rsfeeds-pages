GIMP is very useful, but sometimes doing not well. Or you find a way to capture screenshots via CLI, but the way using xwd command does not work.
In such a case, this article might be your friend.
This article provides you the way to capture screenshots using xwininfo and ImageMagick.
As previous, xwininfo and import of ImageMagick are required.
On Debian and Ubuntu, it needs to install x11-utils and imagemagick packages. To install these, run:
sudo apt install x11-utils imagemagick

Now, we are ready to do!
xwininfo.


To get "Window ID", run following command in a terminal:
xwininfo

Immediately prompts shown like following:

Select the window you want to capture by clicking a mouse. Then information of the selected window is displayed following the prompt.

The most important is the first line including "Window id: ...". So the hexadecimal is a Window ID. In the previous example, Window ID is 0x4000001!
import.


To capture a screenshot of the selected window using import command, it needs to pass "Window ID" with -window option.
Run:
import -window 0x4000001 screenshot.jpg

Finally, the screenshot is saved in the current directory!

I will show you "How to capture the whole desktop" by CLI. 
Passing root keyword to -window option:
import -window root screenshot_whole_desktop.jpg

Linux で時刻同期といえば ntpd が有名ですが、最近は systemd のサービスである systemd-timesyncd が使われることが増えています。時刻同期を無効にしたい、けど手元の環境には ntpd が入っていないみたいだという場合はもしかしたら systemd-timesyncd が使われているのかもしれません。
この記事では systemd-timesyncd が使われているのかどうかを調べる方法と、systemd-timesyncd を無効化する方法、再度有効化する方法を解説します。
ターミナルで下記コマンドを実行します。
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd

systemd-timesyncd が使われている場合、下のスクリーンショットのようにコマンドの出力に "Active: active (running)" という文字列が確認できます。

一方で systemd-timesyncd が使用されていない場合は "Active: inactive (dead)" という文字列が確認できます。

無効化にはルート権限が必要です。
最初に動作中の systemd-timesyncd サービスを停止します。次のコマンドを実行します。
sudo systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd

次に systemd-timesyncd サービスを無効化します。次のコマンドを実行します。
sudo systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd

最後にサービスの状態を確認します。次のコマンドを実行します。
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd

"Active: active (running)" と表示されていた行が "Active: inactive (dead)" に変わっていれば無効化は完了です。OS 再起動の必要はありません。

再有効化にはルート権限が必要です。
最初に systemd-timesyncd サービスを有効化します。下記のコマンドを実行します。
sudo systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd

次にサービスを起動します。有効化しただけではサービスが起動していないからです。
sudo systemctl start systemd-timesyncd

最後にサービスの状態を確認します。下記コマンドを実行します。
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd

"Active: inactive (dead)" と表示されていた行が "Active: active (running)" に変わっていれば再有効化は完了です。OS 再起動の必要はありません。]]></summary>

Today, so many things depend on accurate time-keeping. Thus we don't need to disable time sync usually, but sometimes -- workaround to annoying GPSD bugs and so on -- we need to disable it.
In the past, it was common to use ntpd for time sync. Since systemd-216, the systemd-timesyncd is often used.
This article provides you "how to check systemd-timesyncd is being used", "how to disable systemd-timesyncd" and "how to re-enable systemd-timesyncd".
systemd-timesyncd is being used.


Run following command in a terminal.
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd

If systemd-timesyncd is being used for time synchronization, you can see "Active: active (running)" in the result like following screenshot.

On the other hand, systemd-timesyncd is not used, you can see "Active: inactive (dead)" in the result like following screenshot.

systemd-timesyncd.


At the first, you need to stop the service. To do this, run following command in a terminal.
sudo systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd

Then disable systemd-timesyncd, run following command in a terminal.
sudo systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd


First, set 'enable' for systemd-timesyncd. To do this, run:
sudo systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd

Then start the service of systemd-timesyncd. To do this, run:
sudo systemctl start systemd-timesyncd

Finally, let's see systemd-timesyncd is really enabled. Run:
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd

For Reference value the value is store in the heap, it's a big storage that keep all objects and each object has it's own adress! (Like house in a village, each house has its own adress)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve ever faced such temptation to wrap inner exceptions within some neatly-defined exception type, you’d better off fight the devil. Let exceptions be themselves and freely fly high the call stack. 💸
To elaborate on the issue, consider the hypothetical DataProcessor and the general purpose exception type DataProcessingFailure below:
class DataProcessingFailure extends Error {
  constructor(public innerError: Error) {
    super();
  }
}

class DataProcessor {
  process() {
    try {
      // Some processing
    } catch (err) {
      throw new DataProcessingFailure(err)
    }
  }
} 

Here, the process() method only raises a DataProcessingFailure exception, if any. Whatever exception occurs (e.g., DivisionByZero) the caller of process() just catches a DataProcessingFailure instance. So, DataProcessingFailure is a wrapper exception.
The reason behind advising against wrapper exceptions is the change of behavior that you exert on the downstream system seen by higher level controllers. For instance, you could mask a well-defined exception that itself is an intricate part of the domain model. Another example is when your wrapper could mask network related exceptions, most of which resolve just by retrying, albeit if some caller at higher level of call stack could catch them as they are.
Putting it all together, you’d logically prefer minimizing footprints/side-effects of various components/implementations on each other, so that you could avoid unwanted couplings/special-treatments.
About Regular Encounters

I’ve decided to record my daily encounters with professional issues on a somewhat regular basis. Not all of them are equally important/unique/intricate, but are indeed practical, real, and of course, textually minimal.]]></summary>

What? 🤔

Why? 🤔
Process  ⚙️
☑️  Check your device cache
When you search for a website or web-page , your browser will not know the i.p address of the web server. Your browser will first check its cache memory to see if it has the DNS records for that domain cached. It also checkes the hostfile of your computer/mobile for the ip address.
☑️  Check with your ISP
Your ISP (Internet Service Provider) caches popular sites like Google.com , Netflix.com , (facebook?), Youtube.com etc. If they have the record in their cache, you would skip the rest of the DNS lookup process.
☑️  Root DNS Server & TLD Server
Top Level Domains are .com  .gov  .net  .in etc. 
Master/Authoritative DNS servers which actually contain the server information.
☑️ I am speed
This entire DNS lookup process happens in just a couple milliseconds. For perspective, we blink our eyes in roughly 50 milliseconds. We can resolve most DNS queries in under 30 milliseconds.👀

When diving into the data engineering world, it is important for the set up  to be ready.
To set up a data engineering environment it is advisable to work on Linux Environment. 
To start with we started by using linux as a host machine.
Then we installed Virtual machine VMware. Then on the Vmware we installed the downloaded Windows operating system.
Now in order to make communication between host(Ubuntu) and virtual machine(Windows) we need to make configurations and networking on Vmware.You need to enable VNC connections as shown below.
 
In this guide we walk you through the MSSQL Server installation in Windows on VMware.

We will now install Postgres in our Ubuntu. To install this follow the installation steps here.
For Postgres configuration steps: 
     psql --version





  

  It is advisable to check if the Postgres is running using this command before you proceed
     sudo systemctl status postgresql





  

  Connection To PostgreSQL running.
     sudo -u postgres psql





  

  Installation of AdventureWorks2019 and AdventureWorksDW2019
First in order to start using the databases we start with installing Adventureworks2019 and DW.

Git is the world's most popular distributed version control system used by many open-source and commercial projects. It allows you to collaborate on projects with your fellow developers, keep track of your code changes, revert to previous stages, create branches, and more. Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) developed Git.
A version control system is a system that keeps a record of the changes in a file (or multiple files) over a period. This is so that a user may return to a previous version of the system's software whenever necessary. This article shows you how to install and configure Git in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
In this article, you will learn how to install and configure Git on Ubuntu 20.04 via the Command line.
The operating system running Ubuntu 20.04 Linux
A root or non-root user with Sudo privileges
Has stable internet connection
Terminal window / Command line
Update all system packages to the latest, Run the following command:
sudo apt-get upadate
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

The Git utility package is available in ubuntu software sources, which can be installed by APT-GET. Run the following command:
sudo apt-get install git

Verify the installation, run the following command:
git --version

That’s it, you have successfully installed Git on your Ubuntu, and you can start using it.
Set your global user name and email. Run the following command:
git config --global user.name "<YOUR NAME>"
git config --global user.email "<YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Looking for a serverless hosting service is a big pain when you just want to taste or even host a smal project on it. Today, I found a new resource which lets you create serverless functions for absolutely free! Vercel. So, lets build & deploy our first Serverless function on it!
The platform requires us to install its CLI in order to develop & deploy our functions. Lets do npm i -g vercel to install the CLI globally. After creating a new directory, we'll initialize it as a new node project.

Vercel cli expects us to put all of our .js files in a folder called /api.
.js files will contain 1 default exported function which represents a REST API endpoint taking 2 parameters request & response representing the express's Request & Response objects respectively (just like in normal express.js GET/POST endpoints).
/api/{name-of-file}
So I have created a basic node.js project with following files:



"But how I will create functions without even testing them?"
The vercel cli which we just just installed globally provides a functionality to run the functions on our own local machines.
You will be required by the CLI to login/signup into a vercel account, join me from here after completing that ;)
vercel dev. For the first time running the cli, it requires us to do some quick configs & settings, after completing that you should see something like this:

To check how the functions are working locally, we have to go to http://localhost:3000/api & to access the endpoint in hello.js, we will go to http://localhost:3000/api/hello


Everything looks awesome! lets deploy it on vercel!
Vercel's CLI makes deploying functions as easy as running a command on the terminal, we'll now run vercel on our terminal in the root of the directory.

HERE YOU GO!

You can check limits for a free plan set by the platform here.]]></summary>

APIs are becoming crucial to modern app development. Therefore making sure that the data you pass between your APIs is secure and not compromised is a priority.
Unfortunately, APIs face a number of threats such as SQL injection, Cross-site scripting (XSS), Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), Man-in-the-middle (MitM), and Credential stuffing.
The best way to avoid these attacks and improve your API security is to follow some simple best practices.
Prioritize security
Encrypt your data

This application and the structure can be handled by Lerna — a tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages. What Lerna does (as a part of many features) is the ability to resolve local and global package.json files to use one and correct packages list and representation of dependencies. This means that you can use global packages in all of your services but if you use some package in the frontend app you don’t need to install it for the backend one. And with the Lerna boostrap feature, you can install and manage dependencies for all of your services with one command and process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most folks these days use the ws package.
The steps are simple. Hook into your express app, do not allow ws to create its own server, pick a path. Handle the "upgrade" event that is the protocol negotiating to go beyond simple HTTP.
import express from "express"
import cookieParser from "cookie-parser"
import * as WebSocket from 'ws';

const app = express()
app.use(express.json())
app.use(cookieParser())

// all your normal routes
app.post("/refresh-token", issueRefreshToken)
app.post("/delete-token", deleteRefreshToken)

// and now the magic
const websocketServer = new WebSocket.Server({
  noServer: true,
  path: "/echo"
})
server.on("upgrade", (request, socket, head) => {
  websocketServer.handleUpgrade(request, socket, head, (websocket) => {
    websocketServer.emit("connection", websocket, request)
  })
})

websocketServer.on('connection', (ws: WebSocket) => {

  //connection is up, let's add a simple simple event
  ws.on('message', (message: string) => {
    websocketServer.clients.forEach((client) => {
      client.send(`${message}`)
    })

    //log the received message and send it back to the client
    console.log('received: %s', message);
    ws.send(`Hello, you sent -> ${message}`);
  });

  ws.send('Hi there, I am a WebSocket server');
});


This creates an echo server that broadcasts whatever it receives to each connected client.
To test this, wscat works well.
yarn global add wscat

Then do this in two separate terminals:
wscat -c 'ws://localhost/echo'

Type in one, and you should immediately see it in the other.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[console.log is useful in a lot of situations (although there are usually better ways to debug if that's what you're doing).
In the browser console.log works well with objects, you can drill down as much as you need. But in Node.js, when you look at the output of a nested object, you'll often see this:
$ console.log({a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}})

{ a: { b: { c: [Object] } } }

d: {} was replaced with [Object]. But why?
It's because the command line / terminal doesn't have a nice UI for drilling down, so Node attempts to print up to three levels deep. Beyond three levels it just prints [Object].
This is controlled by a variable in the node 'util' module, called depth, which defaults to 2. You can set it yourself here:
require('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = 0; // top level only, e.g.:
// { a: [Object] }
require('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = null; // print everything, e.g.: 
// {
//  a: { b: { c: { d: {} } } }
// }

It's not a great idea to change an underlying variable, as it might come back to bite later. So a cleaner way is to convert the JSON object to a string and log that. We can use node's built in JSON class and the stringify method:
complexObject = {a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}}
console.log(JSON.stringify(complexObject, null, 2))

// {
//   "a": {
//     "b": {
//       "c": {
//         "d": {}
//       }
//     }
//   }
// }

Note that the 3rd parameter of JSON.stringify, Number 2, controls the number of spaces of indentation, and the 2nd parameter can be used to filter or adjust the objects and properties shown.
Now you can really see what's in those deep Objects.]]></summary>

Event processing is one of the common implementations when building TypeScript applications.
Registering an event as well as executing some actions when an event has been triggered requires an Observable pattern, which provides a unidirectional flow to streams of events, making debugging and error handling with event streams a lot easier.
In this article, we will explore Observables, how they are used to handle event-driven data, and errors and asynchronous data.

 Observable operators
 Transforming arrays with Observable
 Combining multiple operators for event stream transformation

Yeah, with some caveats. But before I disclose those, you probably think that I'm insane for even presenting the idea that you can run VS Code on Android. And you're wrong, sorta.
VS Code is targeted at desktop operating systems, such as Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux distributions. There aren't explicit "Android" (much less mobile) versions of VS Code. So we can't just install it via the Google Play Store or a 3rd party app store like any other app. Rather, we have to run it in a Linux container.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🔍 OWASP has issued an update to its list of the top web app security threats. We'll look at the changes and how they impact your web application environment.



  
  
  
October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month. On top of that, OWASP just celebrated its 20th anniversary. To celebrate, we’re going to run through the newly updated OWASP TOP 10 to remind everyone of how you can better protect your applications, your businesses, and your customers from unlawful and damaging cyber attacks. We’ll also be highlighting where the updates were made and why and throw in some tips on how strengthening your identity solution can help mitigate these threats.
The new Top 10 is still a working draft, and OWASP is soliciting feedback on errors and corrections.
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organization that was set up to help raise awareness around web application security and provides guidance on how to incorporate preventative measures into your applications, infrastructure, and internal processes.  
They have several projects, including an insecure JavaScript application used for security training, but the one that we’re focusing on today is the newly updated 2021 edition of their list of the top 10 threats to web app security.  
Updated regularly, the OWASP Top 10 lists the main security threats that affect web applications today. Each entry enumerates the threat, shows possible attack vectors, and highlights preventive measures to reduce the risk of such threat. At Auth0, we take steps to mitigate most of the issues outlined below, so when you delegate your authentication needs to us, a lot of this is already taken care of for you.
Let’s run through the list, looking at the threats and what we could be doing to make sure our own applications are secure and examining some features of the Auth0 platform that help to mitigate or entirely remove such threats.
For a high-level overview of the list updates, please refer to this handy chart, provided by OWASP:

Mobile apps are handy, but it is hard to fit in reports and other salient features into them. I an era when the usage of mobile phones is higher than web apps, business owners still prefer web apps over mobile apps to work smoothly.
Web Application Development
Web app development is the creation of app programs that reside in remote servers. They are delivered to the users with the help of the internet. Most of the web apps are written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Web app development comprises of front-end and back-end.
Importance of NodeJS Developers in Real-time Web App Development:
NodeJS developers are the ones who have the potency to develop large scale web apps with scalability and high-performance. It should be noted that real-time apps need two-way connections. NodeJS is the solution that helps business owners to develop real-time web apps with ease. In addition, developers with good programming skills can make the server and client to exchange data and communicate freely.

Many of the files in etc end in conf and they're typically just text-based config files that you can modify in your editor (I prefer VIM) as an operating system.
Let's go back to the root: there are a few more directories here like:
boot: it contains the files needed
dev which stands for device files: here you can interface with hardware or drivers as if they were regular files, you might create disk partitions here or interface with your floppy drive
the op directory contains optional or

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[REPO_LINK.GIT
So, I made a python script that connects to a Chromecast and plays video & audio (.mp4 || .mp3) as soon as you drop your file in the chromecast folder...
The idea came when I was looking for a quick way to share files onto my TV or Google Home Max without having to need a dedicated app. So, I hacked the b*tch!
On a serious note...
 
 
A. Know the "friendly" name of your TV (CASDROP_TV_NAME) and Speaker (CASDROP_SPKR_NAME). 
B. Make sure your machine is running python ~> 3.9.7 (not mandatory, but you need at least python 3).
C. Install all dependencies to run this program: pip install requirements.txt
 
 
Step1. Open a new terminal on your unix/linux based computer 
NOTE: I ran these commands in a BASH environment, so I suggest doing the same...
 
Step2. Open params.sh and edit the <> with your own values. I ran into a few mistakes because I was putting in the wrong IP address.
 
Step3. Run the following command in your terminal:
ONLY RUN THIS ONCE!
bash params.sh #you may need to run this command with elevated privileges
 
Step4. Run the app:
1. Start a simple HTTP server:
    `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

2. Run the casting service: 
    `python3 casdrop.py`

3. Drop a file in your watch `CASDROP_WATCH_FOLDER` folder. Which in this case should be the folder we are looking to drop our files.

 


**At this point, your uploaded files should start streaming on the device(s).**

 
 
CASDROP_WATCH_FOLDER => A folder you drop files in, to cast to device(s)


CASDROP_SERVER_URL => The IP address you get from SimpleHTTPServer a.k.a (http://<ip_address>)


CASDROP_SPKR_NAME and CASDROP_TV_NAME=> Displayed name of devices with (Ussually shown in cast menu on YouTube or Spotify mobile app)




  
  
  Here's my sample param.sh file



 


  
  
  Features / Suggestions / TODO:


Currently you can drop a .mp3 or .mp4 which will cast with zero problem. However, I plan on adding more features down

const even = (a: number) => {
  if (a % 2 === 0) {
    return a
  }
  throw new Error(`value: ${a} is even`);
}

as you can see if the value is even we return the number else we throw an error. The normal way of handling this would be to wrap it inside a try-catch and handle the error. But when you have multiple functions this becomes tedious and error-prone.
In the fp world instead of throwing errors all over the place, we convert them to data. This in typescript would look something like this:
type Try<A> = Success<A> | Failure

where Success is a container that wraps some value of type A and Failure is the alternative one that contains the error.
Let’s try to implement this structure! We will use a mix of OOP and FP, to create nicely chain…]]></summary>

Auth0 brings you the new ASP.NET Core Authentication SDK, which improves your development experience and better integrates with Auth0 features! Let's take a tour through the main features of the SDK to see how easy it becomes to integrate your ASP.NET applications with Auth0.
So far, you were used to relying on the standard Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect package to integrate your ASP.NET application with Auth0. That library does its job very well. However, when you move away from implementing the simple login and logout, your code starts becoming verbose until it gets messy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the rule of calling hooks:
Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns.
For the usage in HOC like below taken from https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk/blob/e2f79f1c156e5e82f70cd88fd2bf22dc3be8ecad/src/withLDConsumer.tsx#L43:
function withLDConsumer(options: ConsumerOptions = { clientOnly: false }) {
  return function withLDConsumerHoc<P>(WrappedComponent: React.ComponentType<P & LDProps>) {
    return (props: P) => (
      <Consumer>
        {({ flags, ldClient }: LDContext) => {
          if (options.clientOnly) {
            return <WrappedComponent ldClient={ldClient} {...props} />;
          }

          return <WrappedComponent flags={flags} ldClient={ldClient} {...props} />;
        }}
      </Consumer>
    );
  };
}


Can I use hooks in the returned anonymous function, like below?
function withLDConsumer(options: ConsumerOptions = { clientOnly: false }) {
  return function withLDConsumerHoc<P>(WrappedComponent: React.ComponentType<P & LDProps>) {
    return (props: P) => (
      const [name, setName] = useState('Mary'); 
      <Consumer>
        {({ flags, ldClient }: LDContext) => {
          if (options.clientOnly) {
            return <WrappedComponent ldClient={ldClient} {...props} />;
          }

          return <WrappedComponent flags={flags} ldClient={ldClient} {...props} />;
        }}
      </Consumer>
    );
  };
}

I think it is a "always use Hooks at the top level of your React function", but my friend said it is a "nested function". My understanding to this is that this "nest" should only count from the function component level.]]></summary>

Build a custom Angular Material theme and use the components as they are described in the documentation.
Build a custom Angular Material theme and build your own component library on top of Angular Material by wrapping their components in your own components.

And frankly this is what I usually used them for until I read https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/start-using-ngrx-effects-for-this#handling-the-flow-of-a-angular-material-dialog .

I've summarized key takeaways from Ben Lesh’s talk from RxJS Live Asia and his slides below. Lesh is a member of the RxJS core team and formerly worked at Google on the Angular team.

First, I needed an interface ...
