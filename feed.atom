Electron.JS, in its main purpose - is for creating desktop applications using Javascript. Most popular way of doing so is using React & Node.js.
I will introduce a code architecture for building scalable Electron application - and on the fly - compile the code on chosen OS platform.
I am not going to focus on implementing it with an Electron application because there is no need for this tutorial, but you should know that the best application of this tutorial resides in Electron applications.
We are going to code the application to both Darwin and Windows platforms in one workspace - but as we'll see, in compilation we will be compiling only one (chosen by us) platform code. Because in most cases, you will need to code a code for 2 (at-least) platforms. But, we of-course don't want ‚Ä¶]]></summary>

I moved from my iMac (getting a bit sluggish) to Ubuntu originally and it worked but i didn't "enjoy it", i then tried Manjaro, then Pop!_OS and then finally thought id have a go with Elementary OS.
So far i am really enjoying it! it feels a bit "Mac'ish", Looks nice and feels quick!
But compared to Ubuntu its a little bit different with the Setup of the dev environment, so i thought id write up a little tutorial on setting a Laravel Dev Environment on Elementary OS.

I am currently building out my project for a deno/rust search engine with mellisearch. I needed a web crawler. I built 5 different prototypes, so I am now writing out the guide to make the one I made. 
Since this is a deno backend, I'm taking advantage of the ability to use typescript OOB. Its handy, especially with the ability to create interfaces that can extend others.
What should a web crawler do?
Crawl to a depth blindly
Be rate limited in the calling
Crawl unique links
Parse URLs
Handle edge cases
We are going to make one that does all of those.

Kindly stop this and don't misguide the people as this is really confusing for beginners who are trying to understand what Node.js is under the hood as Node.js has a lot to offer than just a Web Framework or JavaScript library.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to understand the Angular terms and philosophy. One of the most basic building blocks of Angular seems to be a directive.
The Angular glossary says that "A [directive is a] class that can modify the structure of the DOM or modify attributes in the DOM and component data model".
Seems VueJS also has the concept of directive.
directive is some special token in the markup that tells the library to do something to a DOM element."
This includes a reference to the AngularJS framework, and, yes, it seems AngularJS also has this term.
AngularJS docs:  "At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children."
Ok, so it seems that the term originally comes from AngularJS, and Angular and VueJS just inherited it.
I guess, in Layman terms, a directive is a way of "teaching the HTML to do new tricks" (not mine). 
directive?
Still not sure, maybe the creators thought of this term because a directive it's like commanding (giving directives/instructions/orders) to a static technology (HTML) in order to make it smarter.]]></summary>

  Development on Linux


I switched to Linux last year and shifted my development completely to the Linux ecosystem. Tried out arch, Manjaro, Pop OS!, Ubuntu, MX Linux. Development is really productive with a Linux environment.
A few months back I upgraded my potato to a gaming laptop which of course came with Windows pre-installed, I also started gaming. I ended up doing dual boot to run Ubuntu as my daily driver for development, but this eventually meant a redundant set of tools on Windows as well.
Windows released the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 in May 2019. WSL 1 was a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables on Windows. WSL2 built on top is built on the core technology of Hyper-V to provide better support and improved perf‚Ä¶]]></summary>

The first step is to enable the Volar extension and disable the Vetur extension.
If you chose the Typescript option offered by the CLI tool you should be good to go.
If you run into some issues regarding types try adding the following to your tsconfig.json

Well let's first inspect the mathematical concept itself and maybe we can make a projection on typescript/javascript.
In mathematics, a set is closed under an operation if performing that operation on members of the set always produces a member of that set.

Bring-me is a CLI tool used to download popular frameworks from there CDNs so that you can use them offline when needed in mostly Front-End Development scenerios
Summary:
Bring-me scans a bmconfig.json file inside the module's directory to get the most popular frameworks and libraries (bootstrap,bulma,jquery,lodash,phaser at the moment).

Another change that should not add extra scope, is to remove DELETE from the Access-Control-Allow-Methods header.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using MySQL for the last 3 years. In the beginning, the data size was small and manageable.
The problem started occurring when one of our tables grew to a size of 15 GB.
But 15 GB is nothing for MySQL, right? That‚Äôs what we thought.
Digging deeper we found that our index size was also 15GB. This can be solved if keep on increasing the database systems‚Äô size and upgrade it.
To remove indexes, MySQL has drop index available with multiple options like
algorithm_option:
    ALGORITHM [=] {DEFAULT | INPLACE | COPY}

lock_option:
    LOCK [=] {DEFAULT | NONE | SHARED | EXCLUSIVE}

There are still things we need to consider before running this, like what will happen if the table is heavily used and updated very frequently.
Create New table
Copy data to the new table
Create procedures for inserts/updates in the original table
Drop index ( or any heavy operation, like optimize table )
Rename the table back to original
Drop old table
Drop procedures
Those are a lot of things. Wish we had a tool for this, so we could just automate it.
Percona Toolkit by Percona
More specifically for this change, we need pt-online-schema-change https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/LATEST/pt-online-schema-change.html
pt-online-schema-change --alter="ADD INDEX big_table_name (some_column_name)" \ 
--analyze-before-swap --recursion-method=none D=db_name,t=big_table_name,h=hostname,\
u=user_name --ask-pass --preserve-triggers --execute

Above is a simple add index operation. Even if the table is big, in the options we can specify how much CPU should be maintained. How many resources could be consumed by this utility.
What if you had replicas, and the lag becomes higher than usual. We can skip checks for them to avoid interruption.

It happens when we write useEffect hooks. We intend to just run some code when X changes, but then ESLint tells us to add Y and Z to the dependency list.
useEffect(() => {
  setCount(count + 1)
  // eslint-disable-next-line
}, [])

Ignoring this rule is very bad. It opens up our code to a class of weird bugs (ex: count gets a value from the past). But most importantly, it hides bad design in other parts of the component.
I can strongly claim that EVERY useEffect can be made compliant with the ESLint rule while still mantaining the desired behavior. The solutions might not be straightforward, but it is always better to change other parts of the code than to add the rule. The overal benefit will be more consistent code.

So I took the plunge and read the article, to my horror the article was really a messy piece of writing. That is littered with a jigsaw puzzle of tech projects in Singapore to frame a narrative that Singapore is a surveillance state. While bashing local tech community efforts like better.sg in the good work they had done.

When you're adding authorization to an application, there are two crucial questions:
Are users that shouldn't have access actually out?
Are users that should have access actually in?
If you can't answer with certainty both questions, how can you claim to have a secure application? This is something that you can test manually, but a better alternative is test automation. Concretely, I think the best methodology to get there is using Test-Driven Development (TDD).
This piece is about adding authorization to a Ruby on Rails API by following TDD. You can check out this article to learn in detail how to secure a Rails API with Auth0. Also, you can follow this article along with this repository.

If you search in your setup of Gitlab and find a ¬´blocked¬ª pipeline ‚Äî exactly this type of pipeline is the main reason for coverage score staling.
my-job:
    when: manual

To fix this you need to add only one line:
my-job:
    when: manual
    allow_failure: true

And poof, you get lucky, your coverage badge is free of the evil witch curse and updates as it should.
Recently Gitlab guys fixed that behavior. How exactly? Just added default value allow_failure: true for manual pipelines automatically. This is a very good decision, because otherwise, a single manual step may ruin the whole CI/CD prosperity of your project.
my-job:
    when: manual
    allow_failure: false

and poof once again ‚Äî you are stuck with never-ever updating coverage badge. The fix is obvious ‚Äî add ¬´true¬ª for allow_failure or strip this line. But I have no answer to a simple question: what we should do if we need manual pipelines with disabled failure option and updatable coverage badge? Probably, this question should be addressed directly to Gitlab.
This may not be so easy to grasp from official documentation, so I decided to write this article. I hope it helped.]]></summary>

Containers are not a fad. They‚Äôre never overkill for any project and they simplify many aspects of development, even when running locally. With a wide selection of relevant tools and resources, there has never been a better time than now to implement containers in your organization and get ahead of the curve.
What Are Containers?
Aren‚Äôt Containers Just For Larger Organizations?
What Can I Use Containers For?
Benefits Of Containerization
Since containers are designed to run alongside other containers, you can work on smaller aspects and microservices of a project while holding other containers constant. This also makes it easy to test a project with varying combinations of containers.

üß† Remember that a Docker image has a read-only filesystem based on layers which works as a template to start containers in a preinstalled environment, and a Docker container uses this "template" to run isolated applications into a virtualized run-time environment with a normal filesystem.
No, you can run commands with other users using the Dockerfile as well. You can see an example here.
When you are testing a random software within a container you might need to publish a port on the host OS, or into another computer. In this case you can't add a forwarding port rule to an already existing container, so here is when docker commit comes to save us:
$ docker commit my_container my_image
$ docker run -p 8080:80 -it my_image

Now we can access to the port 80 in the container using http://localhost:8080 in the host OS.
docker commit can also be used to attach new volumes to the container.
Remember that it's a good practice to keep your Docker images as minimalist as possible. Also the reproducible way to create and ship images is the Dockerfile.

We are doing this for a couple of reasons all of which have to do with improving the developer experience. Now that we are slowly merging the first parts of this migration we would love to share some insights into why we didn't just go with TypeScript in the first place and why we have decided that the time was right now.
Before working full-time on Medusa we did agency work for a handful of different e-commerce clients; one of them wanted to migrate away from their solution back then and when we couldn't find a new suitable platform for them we agreed to build a custom solution from scratch. We didn't intend for this to be anything other than a solution that would optimize and automat‚Ä¶]]></summary>

i was a windows user for 11 years, recently switched to Linux Mint..
The Good.
the way WIFI connects within seconds contrary to windows make me literally drool.
like some times my laptop would be in sleep the whole night and as soon at i wake it in the morning it already would be connected to the WIFI
on the contrary windows takes 69 years to connect
software installation process with terminal was super straight forward, i loved it.
your imagination is the limit when it comes to customization
UI is ‚ù§Ô∏èüò© (or maybe windows UI is just too shitty)
The Bad
No Photoshop, No Office, No Vegas Pro
yes there are alternatives, like libreoffice, Gimph..
i hate them, they suck.
libreoffice works but best of luck with the formatting of files your friend sent you
random freezes, my laptop used to just freeze, nothing worked... tried everything under the sun to recover from this stuck phase and preventing it, even mad it to mint forums, nothing... only solution once there was to hard reboot.
poor software updates, third party software updates matter because the come baring bug fixes, third party software like slack, quickdock, even whatsaap for desktop, all plagued with bugs.
this one is not that significant but the booting time in Linux was a bit higher than the windows counterpart, not that noticeable in the long run but coming from windows immediately it caught my attention.
anywho, i came back into loving arms of windows in about two months into my Linux journey, do i regret it, No.
would i install Linux again, No.
do i feel line one os is superior than other, No.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I will show you how to install Docker in Linux Mint and Ubuntu. Docker is a very useful tool which every developer should know. Using Docker you can run many applications with special containers. They are beside your system. For instance you code in php and you need php in your system to run application. With Docker you can install and run many versions of php. Let‚Äôs start!
First of all we should update the package lists:
sudo apt-get update

Next we have to install dependencies:
sudo apt-get -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

Perhaps you have installed all dependencies. After installing dependencies we have to add GPG key:
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

and repository:
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release; echo "$UBUNTU_CODENAME") stable"

When we add a new repository we have to remember to update package lists. So one more time we run sudo apt-get update .
Then we can install Docker in Linux Mint and Ubuntu (we install also docker-compose):
sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose

After installing Docker we have to add our user to a docker group:
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

It is necessary in order to run Docker without root privileges (without sudo). In my opinion running Docker with sudo is not a good idea. Remember restart machine after adding your user to group!
We can check our installation:
docker -v
docker-compose -v
docker run hello world

You should see the version of docker and docker-compose.

I wrote a shell script which install Docker in Linux Mint and Ubuntu automatically:
You can get it on my GitHub.
You can see tutorial on YouTube.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A JavaScript superset, that builds up on JavaScript language, It adds new features to JavaScript, typescript cant run in the browser or even in NodeJS therefore it has a compiler that  compiles typescript to JavaScript. Added features in typescript include the use of types, it also helps us be more explicit and clearer about our code.
Lets look at two code snippets one with Plain Javascript and another in typescript .
Plain Javascript
  let inputA = 1
  let inputB = 2
  function sum(inputA, inputB){
     console.log(inputA + inputB)
  }
  sum(inputA,inputB)
  //this will return 3
  //Now what if we change the inputs to be
  inputA = "1"
  inputB = "2"
  sum(inputA,inputB)
 //this will return 12

Despite the second answer being wrong, we dont get an error notification at run time. Here is when typescript comes in with its additional type feature that guarantees we get the correct answer or an error.In typescript this would be written as(you can test this code in the TS playground):
    let inputA = 1
    let inputB = 2
    funtion sum(inputA: number,inputB: number){
     console.log(inputA + inputB)
    }
    sum(inputA,inputB)
    //prints 3
    //Now what if we change the inputs to be
    inputA = "1"
    inputB = "2"
    sum(inputA,inputB)
    //script.ts(6,9): error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.


Through the introduction of types in typescript, it easier to write more intuitive code. I will be writing a series of tutorial on typescript.
I will cover:
Typescript Basics
Typescript compiler
Classes & Interfaces
Advanced Typescript features such as Generics & Decorators
Stay tuned !!]]></summary>

Microsoft Windows is with us from the start of OS development, from 1985. But this is also not the reason you shouldn't hate Windows.
The only reason I am stuck on Linux/Debian OS is that it is good enough to fulfil my requirements. Similarly, many people are stuck in Windows because it is good enough to fulfil their requirements. 
Well, one of my college friends tried Linux, he search for a piece of software to do some writing stuff, he got LibreOffice, and tried it. FOR HIM, LibreOffice wasn't good enough. I told him to use Google Docs as well, but at the end of the day, it didn't match with him.
Also, he was a Valorant player friend. He search how to install Valorant in Linux? And guess what, he got disappointed, Valorant isn't playable in Linux, aka: BANNED
So, we need to keep in mind that if something fulfils our requirement why one should change he/her workflow.
In a nutshell, we all want our tasks to be accomplished as soon as possible. If something we currently own and does the task we want without any issue, we're good to go with it.

sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
To use Certbot you should have server_name in your Ngnix config. For example, this is a sample of how my Nginx config file looked like before Certbot.
server{
        root /home/pi/website;
        server_name example.slashtechno.com;
}

Once you have the config set up properly, restart nginx. On most systems it will be the following command.
