        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inheritance remains one of the most relied upon and misunderstood features of JavaScript to this day. Since ES2015 JavaScript developers have been able to ignore how the inheritance sausage is made by relying on the class syntax that hides the nitty gritty details, until they run into its mind-bending edge cases.
In this post we'll explore the secrets of JavaScript inheritance: [[Prototype]] and constructors.
But first, put your knowledge to the test:
console.log('Overriding getters and setters');

class SuperClass {
  _value = undefined;
  get value() { return this._value; }
}
class SubClass extends SuperClass {
  set value(to) { this._value = to; }
}
const sub = new SubClass();

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last couple of years, I have been in the Linux space and mostly tried to find the best distro, best file manager, best terminal etc. I was caught up in the loop of finding the best programs to handle a job. This approach, unless controlled, usually leads to low productivity in the long term.
How so you might ask ? Well, this behavior is really relatable for some people. When I am talking about this subject, some of you might probably say, "Oh yes I have been there". In Linux world, there is even a term for this. Ricing.
Ricing means tweaking the configuration of your working environment to suit your personal needs. At particular level, one might consider this useful, and it indeed is. There are some workflow approaches, shortcuts and others that helps the developer access files and folders faster, learn by muscle memory and perform some set of actions quicker. Past that particular level and you are now in the over-ricing zone. Where you are essentially tweaking every aspect of each program, work environment to your needs, but at the same time you are never satisfied so you keep tweaking and changing settings, configs and what not. It reduces your productivity and at the end of the day when you look back, you realize you have done nothing but tweaking some stuff to find the best work environment.
This is what I call the loop (referring to the Bandersnatch here). You are in the loop. You need to get out and you need to get sh*t done. Don't worry about using the best tool out there, don't try to find the absolute efficient program. Just get it done.
This is in actuality a paradox. The paradox goes as such, "The more choices you have, the less satisfied you are". Seems about right when you think for a bit.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Ubuntu/Debian/Nitrux/Manjaro ARM as my main go-to OS' for several years now. I absolutely love being part of this vast community of great individuals.
"Linux is difficult" - "Packaging is hard" was once the most predominant ways for software companies to tell users, why they didn't support Linux. 
But these days we got things like AppImages[1], which I think is very underappreciated within the community (just a feeling, no figures to back it up). Actually I'm unaware why AppImages aren't already part of all Linux distros out there. I guess it's because everyone is trying to roll their own distribution formats?
Anyway, An AppImage is a container format much akin to Mac Applications. You just download an AppImage from e.g. AppImageHub[2], set the execute permission on the file and off you go. No installation required - you can even place the AppImage file where ever you'd like. If you want to skip the "set execute bit" step and need tighter GUI integration there's a daemon called appimaged[3] that you can run beforehand which will take care of all this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A brief and useful content about the mechanics on Cross-Origin Read Blocking, Cross-Origin Resource Policy and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing against Meltdown, Spectre and CSRF Attacks.
By design, Cross-Origin Read Blocking validates browser requests before they even reach the server using their MIME type as a validation rule.
To enable it, send the HTTP header X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff  from the server.
Cross-Origin Resource Policy is a complementary CORB mechanism for validation applied to requests flagged with no-cors to invalidate them if they came from different domains or origin.
Send the header Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy from the server with values same-origin or same-site to invalidate no-cors requests from different domains or origin.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a logical context mechanism that ensures minimal security in the way that users consume web content using browsers instructing how the browser will validate the origin of the requests.
To define rules about how the origin of the request will be identified, send the HTTP header Access-Control-Allow-Origin using values like <exact_request_origin> and even a more generic approaches using *.
Hope that now you understand a bit better why to use these Cross-Origin Resource features
Try don't disable or ignore them in your web applications. Spectre, CSRF, and Meltdown attacks are really dangerous.

From Local Machine
ssh -L localhost:5900:VM-IP:VNC-Port-Number username@hostmachine.com

For Example
HostMachine: dhanesh.vm-test.com (Public IP)
ssh -L localhost:5900:192.168.100.100:5912 dhanesh@dhanesh.vm-test.com

Finally open the VNC viewer and type localhost:5900 you can able to see the VM from your local machine.

sudo virsh list --all. # to all the VM in the Host Machine 
sudo virsh destroy <vm-nam> # Stopping or Shutting down the VM
sudo virsh dumpxml vm-name > vm-name.xml # Export the VM setting in XML Formate
sudo cat vm-name.xml | grep source # to list the attached Partition
sudo lvremove /partition/name # remove the LVM Partition 
sudo rm -rf /RootParition/Centos.img # To remove the .img and .qcow2 partitions
sudo virsh undefine <vm-name> # Removing the VM from the Host Machine, before execute
sudo virsh vncdisplay # to display the VNC port number

Host Machine should have the Public and Private Network and VM should configured via bridge network from Privat network. 
Using SSH tunnel we can connect the VM, before pls install VNC viewer in your local - https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/
From Local Machine
ssh -L localhost:5900:VM-IP:VNC-Port-Number username@hostmachine.com

For Example
HostMachine: dhanesh.vm-test.com (Public IP)
ssh -L localhost:5900:192.168.100.100:5912 dhanesh@dhanesh.vm-test.com

Finally open the VNC viewer and type localhost:5900 you can able to see the VM from your local machine. 
Ensure that all the Network settings are working fine.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Usually we work on different version for our nodejs project and its hard to manage them,but fortunately there is tool called NVM(node verion manager) which help to manage your node version and switch between them according to your projects.


  
  
  Windows installation


Unfortunately nvm project is only for linux/macos, but...but there is another very similar project by Corey bulter,known as nvm-windows. Click this link  download the nvm-setup.zip file and install it in a mundane fashion as on windows.


  
  
  Linux installation


In your terminal use curl to install
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/v0.34.0/install.sh | 

after installation you need to add a bit of configuration in your .bashrc file or .zshrc etc. So, open the file and append the below code.
$ export NVM_DIR="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME/:-$HOME/.}nvm"
[ -s :$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

This sets the path to directory of installation.



  
  
  usage


So let's jump into the terminal and look at some of the commands.
To Install latest version of node




$ nvm install node

Install specific version




$ nvm install {node_verion}

#example
$ nvm install 10.0.0

command to list out all the versions installed




$ nvm ls

Switching between different node versions




# to use latest version
$ nvm use node  

# for a specific verion
$ nvm use 10.0.0  

Deleting node versions




$ nvm uninstall {node_version}

As this was an introductory post, we looked at some of the most used commands, this is a very useful tool if you are working on multiple projects which requires different version of node. You can have a look at the official nvm https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm gitrepo to understand thoroughly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are new here, then please visit our earlier article over here for some context. 
After the last article we were trying to find out ways to improve upon the approach but at the same time didn't want to do anything crazy either. 
That is when we found out about Buddy. Buddy is one of those easy DIY devops tools out there. Best part is the UI and how easy it is to create a deployment pipeline. 
Okay so back to our task. We added this line in our package.json file under the build script.
    "build": "nest build && mkdir -p build && node obfuscate.js && find ./build -name '*.ts' -type f -delete && cp package.json build/",

The above line creates a folder called build, obfuscates(make it unreadable) and remove all the .ts files. We also had to copy our package.json file into the build folder so that we can install our dependencies at our destination.
Then we setup a pipeline in Buddy. 

We made 3 actions. Actions are more like a sequence of steps.  
The first one "Execute" created a build folder and obfuscated code.



The second one copied the build folder to the client's server.



The third one basically started the project.





  
  
  Feel good moment


Once the actions were setup we started our pipeline and kept looking at this "feels good" UI while it was running.

After the pipeline completed, we logged into our server and were able to see our instance running. Phew!!! And this is how our code looks now. Not the best of encryption, but pretty hard to read/modify.

This solved our problem to a major extent. The only drawback we found was the speed of execution. It takes around 2-3 minutes for the entire process to complete. But we are sure there are ways to optimize it. So we are looking forward to it.
Let us know your comments.
Happy programming!!!]]></summary>

When you start working more and more with Azure permissions you will undoubtedly have used Azure RBAC (also known as IAM) and have most likely used some of the great built-in roles that have been created and provided by Microsoft, but sometimes you may come across a requirement or a need to have a very specific role tailored with a set of permissions that are more granular than what comes out of the box in a standard Azure (RBAC) built-in role.
Luckily Azure offers a great deal of flexibility when it comes to defining your own custom roles vs built-in roles. This is where Custom Role Definitions comes into play.

So I downloaded the king of CLI text editors, Vim.
Now, guess what happened.
Yeah, you're right. I stuck inside vim and couldn't even quit from there.
Then, I started watching a bunch of tutorials and started reading vim's documentation.
This tutorial from Ben Awad helped me to get started.
But then I realized, I have to learn a lot of things only to operate vim and it's a pretty lengthy process.
At that time, I really needed a very simple text editor for doing basic stuff.

One thing that I have noticed that a lot of developers who start using Angular who have come from a different technology stack, is that they try to apply the style and approach they have in another framework or language to Angular. This can lead to extremely messy code or Angular code that is hard to maintain as a project grows.
The reason I feel this happens is Angular is an opinionated framework, there is an approach you take to write Angular apps. If you try to ‘build’ an Angular app in a way that goes against this approach, then things can start to go wrong.
In Angular there are some things you should do:

The process involves setting up a program, along with the participating brands and locations. And then registering or helping your users register their cards on the Fidel platform. Once they are live, Fidel receives transactions from participating locations and will pass them along to your application using webhooks. You can register your webhook URLs in the Fidel Dashboard and start receiving the transaction data.
There are two main steps in the process, and this tutorial is going to walk you through building an application with a card-linking feature.

Blame Netflix or Spotify.
In fact, take your pick of any of the digital brands that have made seamless and beautiful UX a staple part of daily life. From one-click checkouts on Amazon to Single Sign-On across all of Google’s services, consumers have never had it better for digital experiences….and they are now expecting it everywhere they go online. 

Login boxes are the first thing many people engage with on a website. Yet, the importance of them can sometimes be relegated to “as long as it works, it works.”
The challenge is consumers don’t just want things that work; they want things that work so well they never even notice it. 
And so here are five ways in which your login box is turning your customers away from your brand.

Today I will describe how to start chat with IRC with my favorite IRC Weechat client, it's a terminal client, but don't worry, it's very easy to configure and use on a daily basis, and if you have your own server you can even set it up in screen -S weechat :)
Shall we get started? Here we go!
First we need to install our new IRC client, there are many ways to install it, depending on which system you use.
pacman -S weechat and on macOS brew install weechat.
No worries as you saw the word compile, weechat is very easy to compile :)
You can skip the compilation step and download the finished weechat from weechat.org. But what fun is that?

Understanding of AWS Custom resources
All through the blog I will be mentioning terms custom resource lambda and custom resource. Both terms look similar but actually are different. Custom resource lambda refers to the lambda that is responsible for implementing the logic. Custom resource is the resource itself that is created by invoking the custom resource lambda.
In this blog I am covering a niche scenario related to AWS custom resources when all your custom resource lambda needs is to call an AWS API. Usual use case of doing so would be when cloudformation does not support a resource and it is only available with an API.

Vim is often called a "programmer's editor," and so useful for programming that many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though. Vim is perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing configuration files.
The vim text editor is an extremely powerful tool for developers, but it can be difficult to master.  If you are new to vim, I recommend these exercises
If you're using a Mac or a Linux machine, it's likely that your terminal has vim built in, so it's worth being familiar with to work on those systems. 
If not, you can install vim with your package manager or test if vi is installed.
To install vim for Ubuntu, follow these instructions.
1: Open a terminal window and type sudo apt-get install vim
sudo apt-get install vim

2: If you want to get updated version of vim, open a terminal window and type sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get update

3: Then type sudo apt-get install vim
sudo apt-get install vim

The installation process will take some time, after which all the commands of vim will be available.

To start vim, just type vim in the command line
vim

Then you can type ESC followed by :e filename to open filename.
To open a vim directly from the command line, type:
vim filename

Press ZQ to quit vim without saving. Press ZZ to save and exit.
To move the cursor, you can press ESC and use the keys h,j,k,l.  You can also use the arrow keys in vim.

Vim has modes. To switch to writing mode, press the i key or the insert key. To switch to command mode, press the ESC key.
To save your file press ESC followed by :w.
Press :Explore to open the file explorer. Use the j and k keys and press enter to open the file. You can also use :LExplore]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning Linux commands is one of those things that help you in your everyday life as a programmer, systems administrator or IT professional. So today I compiled a list of everyday linux commands that you might find useful in real life.
Linux is solid, but you don’t realize how much you depend on it until something goes wrong. Whether it’s a simple fix or you have no idea what’s going on. We’ll start with the basics:
ls : List contents of directory
$ ls
public_html

$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 owner group 0 Jan 23 13:09 index.html

$ ls -l /tmp/
total 616
drwxrwxrwt 27 root root 4096 Oct 22 14:09 .

cd : Change directory
user@hostname:~$ cd /etc
user@hostname:/etc

user@hostname:~$ cd /usr/local/bin
user@hostname:/usr/local/bin

pwd : Show current directory
user@hostname:/usr/local/bin$ pwd
/usr/local/bin
user@hostname:/usr/local/bin$ 

sudo : run command as root (admin)
$ sudo ls
[sudo] password for user: 

run a program
$ ./app

As a Linux user, you have more commands than you can count at the tip of your fingers.
In fact, you have enough commands to do every day tasks, including:
Using git version control for your project
Connecting to your web server over ssh
Controlling your file system
Searching for files containing a particular word in the file path
Backup databases or interact with them
See your web server logs for security attacks
Opening up a terminal-based text editor either locally or remotely

Usually, you may see || and && logical operators in if cases.
if (case1 || case2) { 
  doSomething()
}

So you may expect that || and && returns a boolean value, but it is only correct if values on both sides of these operators are boolean as well. 
Actually, these operators return one of their arguments. E.g. if they were functions they would be implemented like this.
function or(a, b) {
  if (a) {
    return a
  }
  return b
}

function and(a, b) {
  if (a) {
    return b
  }
  return a
}

It may sound and look a bit confusing, but let’s dive into examples.

I frequently look at type definitions before I read API docs.
React Query was initially written in JavaScript (v1), and was then re-written to TypeScript with v2. This means that right now, there is very good support for TypeScript consumers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Computer Vision(CV) is a field of Artificial Intelligence(AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs- and make recommended output based on that.


If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.
CV trains their machine to do such work but it should do those work in lesser time with the use of cameras or algorithms as compare to retina or nerves.
48.6 billion by 2022.



  
  
  How does Computer vision works?


Computer vision requires lots of data for getting good accuracy.
openCV 
There are many research has done in this field, but apart from it there are many uses of CV in business, entertainment, transportation, healthcare and everyday life.
Image Classification:
It sees an image and can classify it (a dog, an apple, a person’s face).
Object detection:
It can use image classification to identify a certain class of image and then detect and tabulate their appearance in an image or video.
Object Tracking:
It follows or tracks an object once it is detected. This task is executed by with image capturing in sequence or real-time.
Content-based image retrieval:
It uses computer vision to browse, search and retrieve images from large data stores, based on the content of the images rather than metadata tags associated with them.(PS:This is most useful application of CV)
You can check out my github repository where I have made many projects based on CV.

Shell aliases can be easily defined by the following syntax:

//give permissions
/home/your-user/www.apachefriends.org/xampp-files/Accedemos to its location and from the console we give permissions.
chmod 755 xampp-linux-*-installer.run
Install it.
sudo ./xampp-linux-*-installer.run
Example...
adrian@asus ~/www.apachefriends.org/xampp-files/7.4.8 $ chmod 755 xampp-linux-*-installer.run
click next next next next until the installation begins 
//commands to use 
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp/lampp start //to start the service
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp/lampp stop //to stop it
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp restart //to restart the service
sudo /opt/lampp/manager-linux-x64.run //to access control panel
****Instalacion HeidiSQL*****
You will see a window indicating that the program is being configured. We wait until it finishes, or until we see a window asking for permission to install dependencies. We click on the "Install" button of all of them so that the wizard takes care of downloading and copying everything necessary, and when the process is finished, and everything is ready on our PC, we will see the Wine configuration window. This window has 7 tabs, through which we will be able to configure the different aspects of this tool.Wine allows us to simulate all versions of Windows. This way, if we have software that can only run on a specific version of Windows, we will be able to load the libraries of that version, and impersonate the version of the operating system, for each of them. We can configure a default version, which will be used in all programs, and add specific EXE files to give each one a version. To verify that it has been installed correctly we will use
NOTE: before starting the Heidi server make sure you have your xampp servers running.

"When should I use NgRx" is a question whose answers have changed several times over the years, and personally I find a lot of the guidance available online to be a little too "does it feel right" and “can something else handle what you are doing”. While informative and a great way to learn about some new libraries, this is largely not helpful for deciding when to say “yes, I would benefit from using NgRx for this project”. Over the last several years I’ve tried to come up with a mental framework for deciding whether or not a project would benefit from NgRx, and decided to share what I’ve come up with and see what others think.
Obviously this is subjective and I would love to hear what others have to say and see what the community would add or remove to t…]]></summary>

Event Emitter é um módulo do NodeJS que nos ajuda a criar um padrão de publisher-subscriber.
Com um Event Emitter podemos simplesmente criar um evento de qualquer parte de uma aplicação, escutar este evento e tomar alguma ação baseado nele.

Para criar um event emitter é preciso instanciar o EventEmitter do módulo events no NodeJS.
const { EventEmitter } = require('events');

const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

Esse é o básico para criar um event emitter. Mas o que podemos fazer com ele? 🤔
A classe do EventEmitter têm uma série de métodos e podemos usá-los para publicar e ouvir eventos. Por hora, focaremos em dois deles:
emit(eventName...)
on(eventName...)
Para publicar um evento nós utilizamos o método emit(). Já para ouvir, utilizamos o método on(). E a …]]></summary>

Feature flags or toggles are often* used in application code to allow for rapid integration of new changes without necessarily enabling them in production.
*I have no real idea how commonly used they really are
Feature flags can prevent the dreaded long running feature branch that keeps accumulating changes that you hold off from merging because you're not ready for it to go into production in the next release.
These same challenges can apply to your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) where having changes to shared resources you want to test in a lower environment but aren't ready to promote to production can be a real problem.
Consider this scenario:
You're making changes to your network in a cloud environment.

In an Angular service, you can simply assign a new value to a property, and like magic - the change detection would kick in and update any component using the property. 
Switching over to React, suddenly immutable state is the way to go! Then, suddenly Redux - actions, reducers, middleware, dispatchers, and the list goes on. 
The first time I saw Redux toolkit, the very first thing that hit me, in Reducers:
...
reducers: {
    increment: state => {
        state.value += 1;
    }
}

What is Component?
Angular Application. It allows us to mark a logic class, and additional metadata for processing at runtime. Components have a template (in above code is './app.component.html') and only one component can be instantiated per an element in a template. 
NgModule. So you should declare it in a NgModule:

II. Angular Service
What is Angular Service?

Angular Service is an JavaScript function that's responsible for doing a specific task. Using Services to exchange and processing data then keeps Components focused on doing business logic on the view.  So it's very helpful to organize a big project that makes codes more clear and clean for development and reusability.
III. Practice
Step to do:
Create an Angular Service

Implement logic for Angular Application

Run and check results
***Note: to do the tutorial, We reuse the sourcecode and continue with the previous post. So please check out it for more details:
Create a new Angular4 Component – Multiple Components Angular Application
1. Create an Angular Service
/angular4client/src/app, choose: File -> New -> Service:


Press Finish,

-> New project's structure:

Log: "WARNING Service is generated but not provided, it must be provided to be used"

-> Need register the DataService by using providers property. So we will do it later in a below session.
We got 2 new files: data.service.spec.ts and data.service.ts. Check sourcecode of the main file data.service.ts:

Checking the filename is especially important when it displayed on a web page to prevent HTML or XSS injection. That’s just on the frontend. On the backend, there are the other usual injections to worry about. Like SQL injection, when storing the name in a database. Or path injection, if storing in a path based on the name.
