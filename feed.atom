After weeks of exams and dealing with imposter syndrome, I am back with another short article on 'file commands' in Linux. These are pretty useful so take a look. 🤠
The 'cd' command moves you into any directory you want. For example, if I have files located in the 'Documents' directory, this is the command I would run:
cd Documents
and this would move me to that directory.

The 'ls' command lists everything that is in that directory. To list everything in the directory, run this command:
ls -l

the 'cat' commands displays what is inside a file. Simply run this command:
cat (name of file)

The cat command also can do other things. 👇
Using this command, you can also create a file.
What I did below was I created the file, typed out what I needed to, then viewed the fil…]]></summary>

If this condition is met do something, else do another thing. It's fundamental to nearly every programming language, but can we ditch the "else" statement?
Like with most things in programming there will be scenarios where using an "else" statement is more appropriate than avoiding it, but let's assume that we want to ditch it no matter what scenario arises. How would we do that and why would we want to?
The best way to explore this approach is through examples so let's start with a simple one. All of the examples below are written in Typescript:

So, I recently had to solve a problem with one of my NodeJS servers. I had to parse and process data from an excel sheet which turned out to be pretty CPU-intensive and it blocked the NodeJS event loop, effectively freezing my server till it's done. I wasn't surprised though; I expected this to happen. While there are several things you could do to resolve this, I'm going to present a solution using the NodeJS worker_threads module. Before we start, let's quickly talk about this thread thing. The code used in this article is available here.

Coleções são, em resumo, uma representação de um grupo de objetos. Uma coleção iterável é um tipo de coleção onde pode-se iterar nos elementos. Em outras palavras, são coleções onde podemos navegar nos seus elementos.
Ambas as linguagens (Dart e TypeScript) tem implementações nativas para criação de coleções iteráveis. Em ambas, esse tipo é chamado de Iterable. Cada uma, obviamente, possui uma implementação diferente, mas ambas têm o mesmo objetivo e funções similares.

import { BeersService } from './services/beers.service';
import { WhiskyService } from './services/whiski.service';
import { WineService } from './services/wine.service';

We can simplify it by exposing all files, from a single file, to point to all of them.
Create index.ts, (you can name as you want, but most common is index) and export all services.
export * from './beers.service';
export * from './whiski.service';
export * from './wine.service';

Now we can update our files, to the new path.
import { BeersService, WhiskyService, WineService } from './services/index';

The code looks clean and easy to ready because all of them comes from the same place.

It is a private space that gives you complete control over your virtual networking environment. It allows you to do several things, including selecting your own IP address, configuring route tables, network gateways, and creating your subnets.

  Generic CRUD Service


Before we start generating and writing code, let’s take a step back and see the bigger picture. The generic service should accept the following arguments:
the HttpClient is used for the HTTP requests
the class of model for creating instances
the path of the API endpoints.
Also, all resources should have 5 main methods related to CRUD…
Create - Returns a new resource.

This article is a part of a series about how to create Generic CRUD Service & Models in Angular:
Part 1 - Understanding Generics
Part 2 - What is CRUD?
Part 3 - Generic CRUD Model
👉 Part 4 - Generic CRUD Service in Angular




  
  
  Generic CRUD Service


Before we start generating and writing code, let’s take a step back and see the bigger picture. The generic service should accept the following arguments:
the HttpClient is used for the HTTP requests
the class of model for creating instances
the path of the API endpoints.
Also, all resources should have 5 main methods related to CRUD…
Create - Returns a new resource.
Get all - Retrieves all resources as a list.
Get by ID - Returns a specific resource by ID.
Update - Updates a specific resource by…]]></summary>

The former is required to stay ahead of the curve (being better than one's competitors) while the latter is the springboard to delivery. Thus, a strong platform is an apparent need for every technological company.
Thus, we land upon a concept called Platform Engineering.
As per this definition
Platform engineering is the process through which enterprises adopt (new technology and platforms), leverage (existing technologies and platforms), and transform (shift the dial on delivering value by transforming the way things are done) cloud platforms. It is at the core of designing, building, and operating your cloud infrastructure to deliver the next generation IT ecosystem.

A good solution is show a loading until get the data, but if my users want the beers ready from the beginning ? No problem because Angular have a solution, The Resolvers.
The Resolvers help us to prefetch data, before the router finish start the transition between components, and store.
The resolvers are helpful to avoid show an empty component, and  have our data ready, before move to the component.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are already familiar with Docker and Docker Hub then in this post I’d like to introduce the Azure Container Registry which is an alternative to the well-known Docker Hub.
Things required before starting:
Docker Desktop
Azure CLI
Azure Account
In order to start with Azure Container Registry, you need an Azure account which you can create easily with FREE Credits and also ACR is a very cheap service. Once you logged into Azure, Navigate to Azure Container Registry by clicking on New --> Search --> type Azure Container Registry. After that create a new ACR by filling in all details you want to add but make sure you enable admin access. After Two or three minutes your ACR will be created.
Once you created a resource navigate Access Keys to get the Login server, Username, and password which is required for the command line push your local Docker image to ACR.

Type Above fig command and replace [login-server] with your ACR resource EG: firstapp.azureacr.io [username] with firstapp and [password] with the hash password. Once completed, you should see Login succeeded! Message. After this you need to build your docker image with this command
docker build –f ./Dockerfile . –t node_vue_app


Final step is to push your local Docker image to ACR. Follow below image command to push. Keep in mind though that these repositories are private by default, which means that you have to perform authentication first.

And that’s it. You can make use of this container registry just like you used. In Part 2 we will see how we can deploy same thing using CI/CD with GitHub Workflow]]></summary>

You can either use a third party library like dayjs or momentjs for this, but for small projects, it is better to come up with your own utility function. In this tutorial we will write a util function which will accept a javascript Date object/ a string in ISO YYYY-MM-DD format/ or a date timestamp and convert it to relative time.
Eg:  2020-10-15 will be converted to "an year ago"

Measure twice and cut once.

We wanted the absolute best developer experience for the users. So, we settled after a few trials on a process that worked well for us.
I set up working sessions between the component dev and myself.
Every component started with its own markdown file to document the design.
We put down the ideal developer usage and experience, for the component.
We referenced our existing version, component tickets history and industry leaders.
The states and interactions were then considered.
Once satisfied, we sought feedback from the rest of the dev team.
We also sought the feedback of some key dev community members.
The final design would then be honed, ready for coded implementation.

The delivery of healthcare services has gone through an unprecedented transformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has accelerated the move to a digital-forward model and elevated trends that were previously slow to be adopted. In addition, the final rule of the 21st Century Cures Act, effective June 30, 2020, implements provisions to “advance interoperability and support the access, exchange, and use of electronic health information”.
Technology leaders in the healthcare industry will drive positive business outcomes by continuing to innovate in ways that meet the demands of consumers while also meeting security…]]></summary>

As a new engineering manager, your first 90 days are crucial . You quickly realize the need to gain trust while rapidly building relationships and rapport — not only with your colleagues and your direct reports, but also with all the other discipline stakeholders. As an engineer, you spend 80% of your time with your engineering team, focusing on the engineering aspects of your role. But in a management position, you spend perhaps 50% of your time with your fellow engineers. The other 50% of your time is spent with people who are stakeholders representing cross-functional disciplines such as product, design + UX or the QA department if there is one.
In addition, there are other teams like people ops, recruiting, platf…]]></summary>

This time, I will try generating barcode images by JsBarcode.
JsBarcode - Barcode generator written in JavaScript

TypeScript ver.4.4.4"
canvas ver.2.8.0
dpi-tools ver.1.0.7
Express ver.4.17.1
jsBarcode ver.3.11.5
I can use jsBarcode in Node.js projects.
Node Setup - Install/JsBarcode Wiki - GitHub
import { Canvas } from 'canvas';

function generateBarcode(value: string): Buffer {
    const canvas = new Canvas(100, 100, "image");
    JsBarcode(canvas, value);
    return canvas.toBuffer();

I can add options.
For example, "Code39" can choose adding checksum(Modulus43) or not by "mod43".
In TypeScript files, I can't add "mod43" directly.

One of the very first challenges I faced was making sure I can connect to the internet using my D-Link DWM-157 modem.
After doing some google search I came to know about ‘Modem Manager GUI’ and I was so happy. Opened my terminal and simply typed:

Someone was smiling behind the scene and was whispering not so easy boy! Prepare for the next hurdle.
I was so happy it is a very nice GUI, everything is here for me i just a single click away to check anything. Everything was working perfectly in the GUI except the USSD code !

Modern applications base more and more on micro-services. Splitting large applications into smaller pieces makes the whole more maintainable and easier to develop. However, instead of developing a big monolith, we work on a bunch of tiny applications, making it more challenging to debug and deploy the whole system. Luckily, there are many tools out there to help us out. An interesting comparison of some of them can be found here. In what follows, we want to see how easy it is to do Kubernetes-based development with devspace.
Suppose we are developing a micro-services application, for example an e-shop. In essence, our e-shop consists of a frontend application that communicates with a backend through an API. For the sake of simplicity, let's say …]]></summary>

You can spot the difference: the first one is tied to a well identified service, AWS, while for the second, things are a bit blurrier: we immediately understand that it has to do with a database connection, but, without further context it doesn't tell us what doors it opens.

PS: the title says right way, but it is just my personal opinion. I am not claiming that any other guide does it in a wrong way.
A full-fledged Docker installation on WSL2
Docker Daemon automatic start without any crazy hacks
Docker Daemon sharing between Windows and WSL (i.e. you cannot run docker from Windows PowerShell)
Docker Daemon sharing between WSL distributions
I will consider that you already have WSL2 working, and you are using Ubuntu as your distribution.
Install Docker CE on Ubuntu by following the official guide:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Programming is just one big cycle. Create or download a project, install your dependencies, build something amazing, and move on to the next one. However, with node.js projects, there's a glaring problem.
Every time you move on to another project, you leave incredible amounts of data in the node_modules folder that you may never use again. This can add up... quite quickly.

Don't despair! There's an easy fix, and it's called npkill.
 / 
        npkill
      
    

  











Easily find and remove old and heavy node_modules folders ✨



  


This tool allows you to list any node_modules directories in your system, as well as the space they take up. You can then select which ones you want to erase to free up space. Yay!

Clear space: Get rid of old and dusty node_modules cluttering up your machine.
Very fast: NPKILL is written in TypeScript, but searches are performed at a low level, improving performance greatly.
Easy to use: Say goodbye to lengthy commands. Using npkill is as simple as reading a list of your node_modules, and pressing Del to get rid of them. Could it be any easier? ;)
Minified: It barely has any dependencies.
You don't really need to install it to use it…
View on GitHub
It's an easy CLI that provides a user friendly interface to scroll through all of your node_modules folders, and, if necessary, delete some at the click of the button.
Personally, I think it's an incredibly cool and useful tool, and I'm sure you will too! To get started, just type:
npx npkill

And start freeing space!]]></summary>

All modern motherboards come equipped with an integrated RAID controller, and top models may have several such controllers on board. That’s a different question, though, if such integrated controllers in consumer-class motherboards are ever used by an average user. Anyway, some motherboards do give a chance to setup a RAID array right inside your home PC.

However, the web development industry is rapidly evolving, and developers no longer need to rely on JavaScript to create high-end online apps. Blazor is making it possible to run.NET in the browser without the need for add-ons or plugins, due to a technique called WebAssembly.
This blog will examine the current status of Blazor, its features, and its preparedness for production use, before comparing it to one of the most popular frameworks, Angular.
Here is why you should choose Angular for your next web development project.

awk in essence is a pattern scanning and processing language, emphasis on the language part because awk possesses functionality akin to most mainstream programming languages. 
awk loves tabulated data. So to begin with, you'll need a piece of text represented as columns delimited by some common character. You see this pattern often in shells, for instance, the ls -l command that prints file information delimited by a space :

Les principaux acteurs (librairies/frameworks Javascript) y font tous référence dès la page d'accueil. Angular est connu pour intégrer un bundle plus complet mais plus lourd que ses concurrents directs. Même si ces différentes technologies n'embarquent pas les mêmes fonctionnalités, il reste une problématique à résoudre pour tous : le rendu HTML. Nous allons analyser ensemble le fonctionnement d'Angular dans trois cas précis : la gestion des blocs statiques, la mise à jour du DOM et la mise en cache de valeurs.

A very clever malware designed with 3 components: - trojanized applications, - backdoors, and - rootkits. 🐞
It employs a rootkit to conceal its presence and uses different command and control servers for each sample, maintaining a low profile on your system as if nothing is happening will it cause havoc.
It is designed to launch and mediate access to a local SSH server, update itself, and transmit collected credentials. 🔒
FontOnLake is capable of file manipulation, updating itself, and uploading and downloading files
It accepts remote connections, serves as a proxy and can download and run Python scripts, in addition to exfiltrating credentials.
Surprisingly, this malware targets the one who is immune to most viruses, Linux
And the most scary part is that, it is still under development (and it is this deadly ☠️)
