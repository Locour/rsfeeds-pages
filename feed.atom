What is DevOps for Salesforce?

For the last two decades, Salesforce is standing strong as the leading software platform. Innovation, infrastructure management, versatility, and scalability are just a few reasons why Salesforce commands that position.
However, DevOps for Salesforce is tricky. Most of the core principles and techniques of DevOps fail with Salesforce. One of the biggest challenges Salesforce customers with complex systems face is dealing with thousands of moving parts but lack a systematic way of tracking, managing, and deploying them.
Nevertheless, with the release of Salesforce DX in 2016, a lot of teams are in the p…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being used to npm based projects for years, I encountered a yarn based one yesterday. I've read about yarn before, but never got the chance to work on it until now. So, I searched around to find the basics to get it working. I found it to be pretty similar to npm so far, with a few changes here and there. If you've cloned a project repo already setup with yarn, these are the general instructions to follow:
Make sure yarn is installed globally:
npm install -g yarn

Then, move to project folder and upgrade to latest in yarn 1.x branch:
cd ~/path/to/project
yarn set version latest

Install the project dependencies:
yarn install

And the finally, build and/or run the project. Similar to npm based projects, you can check package.json file in the project folder and find the necessary commands listed there. Should be like yarn build, yarn dev, yarn start, yarn serve, etc.
Another interesting thing to keep in mind is, the yarn equivalents of npm install --save and npm install --save-dev are yarn add and yarn add --dev, respectively. I found it mentioned on the documentation page of yarn install command.
Yarn 2.x is meant to be installed per project. So, follow the same steps as yarn 1.x described above, but just before yarn set version latest, run this:
yarn set version berry

Check if yarn is on version 2.x with:
yarn --version

Now, follow the same steps for 1.x. For more info, refer to Yarn 2 docs.
If you're like me and accidentally installed yarn 2.x on a 1.x based project 😅, don't worry! It's nothing a few commands can't fix. Run:
yarn set version classic

And then follow the steps described above for yarn 1.x. The documentation page for yarn set version command describes more ways to set specific versions.

        <link href="https://dev.to/nikitarudenko/sets-of-props-in-react-and-typescript-3po7"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes when writing an app in React you might have a component that changes its look and logic dramatically depending on provided props. In addition, if a particular prop provided, the other props become either required or restricted. That hidden prop relation can be explained in documentation but if your project uses Typescript there is a great opportunity to utilize what I call "sets of props".
It's usually not the best idea to make buttons look like links and vice versa but let's ignore this for the sake of clarity. The code snippet below is so-called Clickable component which can be either a link or a button that shares the same style but has different behavior depending on props.
import { ReactNode } from 'react'

interface BaseProps {
  children: ReactNode
}

interface AsButtonProps extends BaseProps {
  as: 'button'
  onClick: () => void
  href?: never
}

interface AsLinkProps extends BaseProps {
  as: 'a'
  href: string
  onClick?: never
}

type ClickableProps = AsButtonProps | AsLinkProps

const Clickable = ({ children, as, onClick, href }: ClickableProps) => {
  return (
    <>
      {as === 'a' && (
        <a href={href}>{children}</a>
      )}

      {as === 'button' && (
        <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>
      )}
    </>
  )
}

export default Clickable

The component has four props. children is required in any case so it's put under the BaseProps interface. Both AsButtonProps and AsLinkProps extended from BaseProps and represent two sets of props. The active set depends on the value of the as prop while the type never for unused props makes sure that Typescript will yell if someone is using a prop which does nothing.
Here is a scheme:

This pattern is obviously not limited to props in React. It's widely used in the types of various npm packages. Now you can add it to your arsenal and build reusable components/utils with better API for you and your team.

Best Practices for building containers
Containers are meant to be treated as a single app, and not as a virtual machine. The best practice is to have a parent process and all its child processes as a single container. If you have multiple apps in a single container, you might end up with a running container with an unresponsive core component.
Linux signals control the lifecycle of processes inside a container. And to tig…]]></summary>

Coding a TCP Room in about 200 lines, let’s dive into our adventure! TCP is a transmission control protocol which is one of the main protocols of an Internet protocol suite. This simple program helps us learn about sockets and Client Side Architecture! Python in general is a great language to start with from beginners to advanced!

When I start writing an app, I want to make fast progress, so I fall back to using AWS Managed IAM policies, which are usually too broad and open. Then I add TODO's and promise myself to take care of it later...

Having previously worked with Angular in my past jobs, one of the niceties its' built-in client offers is the ability to capture or intercept outgoing http requests. Since React doesn't care about which libraries we use with our UI, we have to make these decisions on our own.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[📓 SOC 2 is a technical security audit report from the AICPA that evaluates a tech service business’s cloud security controls.


In the last two years alone, cloud-based cyberattacks more than doubled — even though SaaS spending grew just 18%. 
While these numbers are merely a correlation from a statistical standpoint, it does indicate that if your business stores customer data in the cloud, it’s more important than ever for your business to take measures to secure that data. Especially given SaaS spending is expected to increase an additional 36% between 2020 and 2022. 
A SOC 2 certification from the AICPA is a foundational step that will help every service provider reduce security risks. Below is a guide to SOC 2 compliance requirements and certification.
SOC 2 is an independent audit report that evaluates the security controls a tech service business uses to protect the data they process in the cloud. Possession of a SOC 2 report is considered table stakes in the SaaS industry, as the answers to most security questions a customer may have about their business’s security posture can usually be pulled from this report.
“SOC” stands for “System and Organization Controls” and was created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). SOC 2 is one of three SOC reports, each with different purposes and/or levels of transparency:
SOC 1. Used to audit internal controls relevant to a customer’s financial systems. Report usage is “restricted,” meaning its use is limited to auditors, the service organization, and authorized users.
SOC 2. Used to audit the overall management of customer data. Report usage is also “restricted” the same way SOC 1 is.
SOC 3. The same as SOC 2, but the report is simplified and publicly available to increase transparency.

In my case, this situation occurred because I wanted to email attach multiple log files.
Let's first look at the command itself.

Where this works as follows:
zip: The Linux command to zip things
options: We can pass in arguments for the end zip results
zip_name: The output name, without the .zip part
files: One or more files comma separated
To show you the most simple zip command for one file, we could do this.
zip archive test.txt

This will create an archive.zip in that folder containing the test.txt file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, if you have worked on some Angular project and used backend communication with API in which want to add some auth header to every outgoing request you must have used Interceptor to achieve that.
After initial setup of Angular project lets add the below HTML code in HTML template file
<button (click)="callWitInterceptor()" >Call using interceptor</button>
<br>
<hr>
<button (click)="callWithoutInterceptor()" >Call without interceptor</button>

And below in typescript file for our first function callWitInterceptor, for the other one we will add later in the article.
constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
callWitInterceptor() {
    this.http.get('https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random').subscribe();
  }

And interceptor function looks like below and it is to be added to NgModule under providers array.
intercept(request: HttpRequest<unknown>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<unknown>> {
    console.log('Through interceptor')
    return next.handle(request);
  }

You can also refer StackBlitz project from below for a working example.

this. When injected, HttpBackend dispatches requests directly to the backend, without going through the interceptor chain. So as per the definition, we can surely use it for our current use case.
constructor(private http: HttpClient, private httpBackend: HttpBackend) {}
  callWithoutInterceptor() {
    this.httpBackend
      .handle(new HttpRequest('GET', 'https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random'))
      .subscribe();
  }

Now when we click on the Button we will notice that the console is not printed but in the network tab, we can see the API call made.

Hereby using HttpBackend we were able to bypass the application-wide interceptor. Hope you found this interesting and learned something new. Please share and provide your valuable feedback. Till next time Happy Learning!]]></summary>

For new Linux users, let us tell you about how Linux and windows evolved.

In this post, I hope to convince you to consolidate access of these variables into one single-file (or a more structured way of accessing these values) to make it easier to refactor, maintain, and update as your project grows.

Rust in my opinion is very much like typescript on steroids. While Typescript may enforce types in your code if you happen to pass a string to a type expecting a number things will still compile and may even work as expected still. With Rust this is not the case. If you provide an unexpected type either things will not compile in the first place or your software will crash.

There are a number of different components of Node.js that have been intentionally structured to allow you to use standard (as in, how the ECMAScript Specification defines it) ESM by default and extend/augment that experience if you'd like to.
Today, I want to get into one of the baisc elements of ESM in Node.js: the .mjs and .cjs extensions.

Forgive me, the Bart Simpson in me couldn't resist using 'Best Practices' once again. Sure, there's a lot to say to stamp out “best practice” and I agree with most arguments in the article. Framing something as a best practice is subjective, and it could give the impression of being arrogant. But, as grown-ups, I'm convinced most of us know how to deal with the term and see why it's used. So pick the practices you agree on, which you see as 'best' practices yourself.
I have the feeling that the importance of API Gateway in a setup is sometimes overlooked. AWS wrote down the practices themselves (also using the term 'Best practices 😉). But IMHO, their documentation is a tad too brief. Also, the documentation lacks a 'WHY' in general.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tree in Linux


tree command helps to recursively list the directory and its details in a tree format. In this post, we will see how you can use tree effectively to view the directory details.
tree essentials in Linux


To install tree in Ubuntu, Debian Linux distros.
sudo apt-get install tree

To install tree in CentOS:
sudo yum install tree

In Windows, you can issue tree in Windows Terminal.
tree


If you enter tree command without any arguments, it will list out everything from the current directory recursively. Suppose, if you are in your home directory, it will display everything recursively like below.

man tree

.





tree -a

tree -d

tree -f

tree -L 1


tree -P b*


tree backups -P 'SMTP*'


'*' - any zero or more characters
'?' - any single character
'[...]' - any single character listed between brackets
'[A-Z]' - for range
'[^...]'- any single character not listed in brackets
'|' - separates alternate patterns
tree backups -I 'SMTP*'


If you use -P which matches both the directories and files. If the match is found for directories, then the matching is disabled for its contents. Use it with --prune to prune it.

To not to print the file and directory report, use --noreport.
tree bin -P '*.log' --prune --noreport 

tree bin -P '*.log' --prune -J

tree bin -P '*.log' --prune -X

tree bin -P '*.log' --prune -D

tree bin/ -P '*.properties' --prune -h


-F marks directories as * and / for files.
tree -P '*.jmx' --prune -F


It displays directories first over files. To disable, use -U.
tree -P '*.jtl' --prune --dirsfirst



In this post, we have covered frequently used tree commands. Please check my blog for more such tutorials.

So over the weekend, I figured out since I do that, why not make it easier. So I did - I added sort of quick access to my last searches directly in the side menu on the landing page. See it in action below:

One tricky part was how to show the whole content of the search query when its length passes a certain limit. That meant when hovering over it, dynamically change the content of the html anchor a element. On top of that the list is dynamically generated out of the last searches. I like challenges and I described in How to change the content of an html element on hover in Angular how I implemented this.
Another interesting aspect of the implementation was how to dynamically set the background color of the displayed search queries - this is described with the snippets and post at Set css class dynamically in Angular from expression

If your business processes protected health information (PHI) in the United States, you’ll need to familiarize yourself with both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act.
Both pieces of legislation provide legal guidelines for managing PHI in the United States and come with strict penalties for violations. For example, two health care networks were fined $5.5M each in two of the worst violations in recent history.
However, each law manages and protects health data in different ways (and for different reasons). Below is a summary of what each law could mean for your business if it processes PHI in any format.

HIPAA and HITECH are two separate laws with two different goals:
HIPAA was passed in 1996 and was the first U.S. law to regulate how protected health information was managed. It introduced a set of security controls and privacy rights aimed at reducing fraud and waste in health care. HIPAA defined who was required to comply with its regulations (which HIPAA called “covered entities”) and how they were required to do so in order to protect health data.
The HITECH Act was passed in 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to encourage HIPAA-covered entities to adopt electronic health records (EHRs) for managing PHI. It offered financial incentives from 2011 to 2015 to transition to EHRs and to improve the delivery of healthcare. The HITECH Act also introduced new technical security standards (in addition to a few other things below) that complement and enhance HIPAA as well.

There are multiple frameworks being invented for the purpose of simplifying the web development process. It helps increase flexibility and reduces launch time.

Angular was released in 2016 by Google. It is one of the most popular frameworks, and it is best suited for high-performance web and mobile apps as well as complex e-commerce projects. It is not a complete stack platform and can be used for front-end development for client-side applications.

A QNAP NAS storage system consists of several hard disks. To improve resilience and data safety, such devices enable you to create RAID systems of various types. However, even the most reliable storage systems may encounter emergencies like accidental deletion of files, formatting or damaging the hard disk, system errors, controller failures and other hardware issues, which may result in loss of important data.

If NAS works properly and you just removed some important files by accident, you can try restoring them from the Network Recycle Bin.

Often when doing state modifications, you want to merge or add some properties to an object that you get from an API or some other source.

It is a good practice to have some sort of mocking mechanism so we can start coding as soon as we can and also make our unit testing less error prone by using well known data.
Yes, but that sounds overly complicated to achieve. We need to turn off and on the backend, swap modules around to enable or disable the mocking and be careful to not deploy any of that the production.
Well, not anymore.
MSW as they say, is the API mocking of the next generation. Right, but what does that mean? It works by intercepting requests on the network level or in other words, by using a service worker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Linux systems, by default, the history does not include a timestamp, which can be annoying when you want to see when a command was executed to determine an update or some kind.
So today, I'll be showing you how to enable timestamps for the bash history in Linux.
Before we get started, let's look at how the history works and which files are attached.
The bash history is kept so we can retrieve whatever actions some user did.
To retrieve this history, we can type the following command.
history

It should come back with something that looks like this.

To find where this file is located you can run the following command.
echo $HISTFILE

It will generally come back with a location like:
/root/.bash_history

However, to change the history output, we have to make a change in the configuration settings.
These configuration settings are set in a file called .bashrc.
We need to add the HISTTIMEFORMAT config settings, which will change the output.
There are two ways to include this in your .bashrc file.
Manually open the .bashrc file and paste it in.
Echo it into the file.




# method 1
nano ~/.bashrc
# now paste:
export HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F %T "

# method 2
echo 'export HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F %T "' >> ~/.bashrc

The format we are using includes the %F and %T variables which stand for:
%F: full date (year-month-day)
%T: time (hour:minute:seconds)
Now you won't see the change yet. We have to enable it, which we can do by rebooting or simply running this command:
source ~/.bashrc

Now when we run the history command, we should see something like this.

As you can see, we now have timestamps in front of our history!

If you want to skip ahead, take a look the finished project here.
If this is your first time using the CDK, bootstrap your AWS account. The Prerequisites section in this guide has the steps.
Start by installing the CDK npm package and running the cdk init command. This is helpful because it gives you a directory structure along with a very minimal stack to get started.

  The following are the steps to setup the dev environment {


• install node 
to compile the file and automatically you should have a JavaScript file created 
• enables you to add multiple values in one variable


• allows you to add multiple core types


 • enum helps you delaring set of named constants


}

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
