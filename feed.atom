        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So far, we have seen two distinct principles for functional programming:
Don't alter a variable or object - create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function.


Declare function parameters - any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments passed to the function, and not on any global object or variable.





Let's rewrite the code so the global array bookList is not changed inside either function. The add function should add the given bookName to the end of the array passed to it and return a new array (list). The remove function should remove the given bookName from the array passed to it.


Note: Both functions should return an array, and any new parameters should be added before the bookName parameter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continuing from the last post. We didn't alter the global variable value, but the function incrementer would not work without the global variable fixedValue being there.


Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.


There are several good consequences from this principle. The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, and it won't depend on anything else in your program. This can give you more confidence when you alter, remove, or add new code. You would know what you can or cannot change and you can see where the potential traps are.


Finally, the function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it.


Let's update the incrementer function to clearly declare its dependencies. Let's write the incrementer function so it takes an argument, and then returns a result after increasing the value by one.




var fixedValue = 4;

function incrementer () {

};

Answer:




var fixedValue = 4;

function incrementer (num) {
return num + 1;

};

console.log(incrementer(5));

The function incrementer did not change the value of fixedValue and the function also took an argment num.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The issue in the previous posts was with the splice call in the tabClose() function. Unfortunately, splice changes the original array it is called on, so the second call to it used a modified array, and gave unexpected results.


One of the core principles of functional programming is to not change things. Changes lead to bugs. It's easier to prevent bugs knowing that your functions don't change anything, including the function arguments or any global variable.


Let's try to master this discipline and not alter any variable or object in our code.


Let's fill in the code for the function incrementer so it returns the value of the global variable fixedValue increased by one.




var fixedValue = 4;

function incrementer () {

}

Answer:




var fixedValue = 4;

function incrementer () {
  return fixedValue + 1;
}

console.log(fixedValue); will display 4
console.log(incrementer()); will display 5;

The function incrementer did not change the value of fixedValue(which is 4). and incrementer function should returned a value that is one larger than the fixedValue value.]]></summary>

An imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task. Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. A classic example is writing a for loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.
In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.

with AutoHotKey you can remap some key behavior to write quick and easy all those operators used day to day.
You need to have installed AutoHotKey and create a file called js-remapkeys.ahk with this script.
#NoEnv ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
; #Warn  ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.
SendMode Input ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir% ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.

Recently, I need to build some function revolving around syncing contacts and calendar events. They were mostly based on an old protocol named WEBDAV. It's so old that it uses convoluted xml structure to represent data. It would be hard for me to handle data since JSON is the first class citizen in javascript while xml is not. 
I took a look at all the existing solutions. They either are no longer maintained or lack core functions. Therefore, I've decided create a brand new library in order to fulfil these goals:
Allow using json data. In order to handle data with ease.
Support a wide range of protocols. Not just one of the three DAV families…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a short post going over how reactive design can help you manage data sanitization issues using just javascript. There are no plugins for this, its plain ol' js. The observable class is custom. I've been building out my Send Newdz Client for my project (https://github.com/yugely/SendNewdz).
I wanted to take some time from doing that to just give a quick tutorial on doing some reactive programming with js, as it is a bit of a different concept than other languages and observables. I'm not using rxjs as I'm not dealing with module import problems. So I have to build it on my own. Luckily it's easy.
Code:
class Observable { //custom
    constructor(functionObserved) {
      this._functionObserved = functionObserved
    }
    subscribe(observer) {
      return this._functionObserved(observer)
    }
}
let
 myObservable = new Observable((observer) => {//create observable
    setTimeout(() => {//timeout function
      observer.next(demoArray)//data being passed in, next is custom type
      observer.complete() //complete is custom type
    }, 100)
 })

//make array
var demoArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

//create sanitize function 
let sanitize = {
    next(demoArray) {//sanitize
        if (demoArray.length < 10) {
            //throw new Error("The array is less than 10")
           throw new Error("The array is less than 10")
        }
    },
  complete: () => {
      //complete if sanitized
        console.log("sanitized")
    }
  }
  myObservable.subscribe(sanitize)//startprocess

It's commented out to explain it. Basically instead of observing a variable change, you observer functions to change data.]]></summary>

I am assuming that you are totally unaware of TypeScript. TypeScript, As name suggest it is a Type checking language!
TypeScript is not a brand new language! TypeScript is a super-set of JavaScript, which means you can still use the same syntax you have used in JavaScript! 
Before I tell you directly how does things work in TypeScript Let's talk about our favourite language JavaScript.
JavaScript is a Runtime Language! That's means everything happens at runtime. We cannot compile JavaScript like Java, C++, C.

You know which sources to trust when you are reading information on social media, yes, we are talking about verified accounts on social media. In-order to minimize the continuously exploding phishing frauds in the inbox, Certifying Authorities have taken an initiative to issue verified mark certificates for brands to show their brand logo in the email inbox.
To make this challenging task a reality Google announced full support for the movement. This functionality will use BIMI standards (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) to show the verification mark within email clients.
BIMI provides a secure, global framework enabling email inboxes to display sender-designated logos for authenticated messages. It also includes protections to prevent senders from spoofing logos owned by other organizations


What are the benefits of BIMI? 
BIMI offers several important benefits to end users as well as to marketers across the globe.
BIMI can reduce the amount of phishing activities.
It offers improved email security by using existing email authentication technologies like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.
Provides a great opportunity for every marketers email to get read first because of logo recall.
BIMI increases the confidence in the mind of a recipient as they see a verified logo against the sender name.
What are Verified Mark Certificates ?
Verified Mark Certificate in Action

How to get Verified Mark Certificates?
As of now Google & the BIMI group has not rolled out any specific date of its implementation. As per Google the pilot testing has started and will be made live for all by the end of 2020. An organization would require getting VMCs to show BIMI standard logos.
In case you would like to register for BIMI and want numerous VMC then contact us.  We will get back to you with all the relevant details at the earliest.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While giving a code walkthrough, some one recently asked "How do we keep our dependencies updated?" and "what is the meaning of caret ^ in package.json?". This seems like a very easy question, but sometimes it confuses people and i feel it's good to know these little things.

tilde (~) in package.json, it means when someone gets your repo or package and try to install the library, it is going to install latest patch version.
So if package.json looks like this:
...
"dependencies": {
  "some_dependencies": "^4.17.1",
},
...

So if the latest version is 4.17.11 then 4.17.11 version is going to be installed.
caret (^) in package.json, it means when someone gets your repo or package and try to install the library, it is going to install latest minor version.
so if package.json looks like this:
...
"dependencies": {
  "some_dependencies": "^4.17.8",
},
...

And latest version is 4.18.9, then if we do npm i it is going to pick up 4.18.9 version.
When it is written as ("lodash": "*") it basically says to go ahead and install its absolute new version. This is not always a good idea, it might break your system, so we need to plan these kind of changes.

Especially during the pandemic, there has been a constant need for tracking symptoms related to COVID. Now that many countries have vaccinated a significant portion of their population, authorities are also looking to track people not vaccinated. 
While it may seem to be a great idea to use IoT-based solutions for tracking and tracing COVID-related data, security can be a concern here. According to a research paper prepared based on a security survey of more than 40 android apps used for contact tracing of COVID patients, tracking symptoms shows that about 55% of them store sensitive data in cleartext. At the same time, 55% of these applications also have been producing insecure random values.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are wondering how to create a TypeScript BackEND project, fear not my brave knight. It's way easier than you can ever imagine!! Let go!
First init our project by running npm init -y on our terminal, it'll create a package.json file. Then let's install these packages by running the following command on our terminal
npm i typescript ts-node express @types/node @types/express

typescript is the core package for typescript, ts-node is the node version for runnig .ts files just as we do with node app.js, in this case we do, ts-node app.ts. @types/node and @types/express has all the types for node and express respectively. You say why? Well typescript is all about type na :)
Now let's install some helping dev stuff
npm i --D nodemon ts-node-dev

ts-node-dev package binds nodemon with typescript. The typescript version for nodemon app.js is ts-node-dev app.ts
Now let's update our package.json file
  ....keep others unchanged
  "main": "app.ts",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "ts-node app.ts",
    "dev": "ts-node-dev app.ts"
  },
  ...keep others unchanged

Run the following command, it'll will create a tsconfig.json file.
tsc --init

Let's create an express App
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';
import path from 'path';




// -------------------firing express app
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:false}));
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'client/build')));




// -------------------routes
app.get('/home', (request: Request, response: Response)=>{
  console.log(request.url)
  response.json({ message: `Welcome to the home page!` })
});



// --------------------Listen
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(5000, ()=>{
  console.log(`Server running on PORT ${ PORT }`);
})

Yippie, our very first typescript express app is ready. Let's run and test it
Type either npm start or npm run dev and then go to the localhost:5000 and test it out yourself. Enjoy!]]></summary>

i18next's typescript type definition generator can generate type definitions from multiple language translation json files, supporting nested objects and parameters.

While NextJS is a wonderful tool in its own right, augmenting it with Express makes for a really powerful combo.
You may want to add a custom API to your application without spinning up a separate API service, or you may want to take control of routing, or run some middleware and fetch standard data for your pages before they are served. Perhaps you have an existing API server and you wish to enable it to serve some front end. Another good use case is setting up WebSockets - e.g. for a chat application.
This type of set up is documented in NextJS itself: https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server
In the standard example, they use Node's http package; we'll use Express to take advantage of its middleware and routing capabilities.

I moved back from macOS to Linux and I'm loving it!
Mohammed Ismail Ansari ・ Mar 18 ・ 2 min read
#linux
        #macos
        #setup
      
Arch gave me a fresh new direction to explore and experience Linux the way I never did before. I created a couple of reusable artifacts and it in a way became a base for my second YouTube channel.
Things kept breaking, and I found myself spending more time on fixing things than I expected, even with my prior experience with Linux before I spent four years on macOS.




So I started looking out for alternatives and found the exact thing I was looking for.
I couldn't lose the control I had over my Linux setup back with Arch by delegating it to a graphical installer. So I installed Debian in the way we usually do install Arch.




All this learning had to be documented somewhere so I created another video talking about the process in a little bit of detail.
Moving to Debian meant re-setting up the entire machine, even deeper than what I had to do back when I moved the factory-installed Windows to a smaller partition to make space for my primary Linux partition.




The new setup took away a few issues I never got fixed, and in exchange, brought with it a few other ones. I talked about the similarities, differences, negatives, and most importantly, the positives of the migration in a separate video, adding another episode to my series Back to Linux.
As I did last time, I'll keep my eyes open for ways to improve my setup and workflow, and will keep documenting my learning to be able to share them with the rest of the community.
Needless to say, I'm loving the alternate universe with Debian. Do throw in your ideas and thoughts in the comments and hopefully, we can learn something from each other.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few months, I've been working on a TypeScript project, where I decided to challenge myself to use Functions only. This week, I refactored the codebase to use IOC everywhere, and it feels like I leveled up. 😄
There's been a lot of articles these past couple of years about "functional programming" in JavaScript, and for some reason these are mostly concerned with immutability, sets, map/reduce, and so on. I come from a background of mostly OOP, where the answer to IOC is largely just "use constructors and interfaces", so this hasn't been really helpful.
What was missing for me, was a functional perspective on IOC and dependency injection.
In this article, I will try to illustrate the problems and solutions with a silly example for illustration purposes: for some reason, your b…]]></summary>

Throughout my career as a developer I have heard a lot of people agree that testing our code is something that we should all be doing. Conversely, I have not worked at many places that actually do it. Additionally, and surprisingly to me, rarely if ever do you see a tutorial show any kind of testing when they're trying to teach something unless they're specifically teaching testing.

– Devon Govett (@devongovett)
By no means I want to dunk on Devon. This is just an example of sentiment flowing around the internet. So you, reader, would understand where I coming from.
DX - developer experience. UX - user experience, usability.
Using <button> instead of <div> for a clickable elements is a good for UX (and accessibility). Yet a lot of front-end developers keep using divs or spans or something else. Why is that?
My guess is that because it is much easier to work with div then button, because div doesn’t have built in styles. Developers taking short cut here, and probably unconsciously, selecting better DX.
If using button would be as easy as using div, I guess a lot of people would use it. Maybe if we would thought about DX in the first place, UX …]]></summary>

In order to build NGINX from the source first, we need to install a couple of dependencies for NGINX.

Basic example:

Most of us have come across terms like multithreading, parallel processing, multiprocessing, concurrency, etc., though each of these terms has its own meaning. In a broader sense, we need these because we want to avoid some kind of latency (or have an illusion of doing so) in the execution of regular programs.
To do this, we try to write code that doesn’t necessarily runs in order (non-sequential) and all this boils down to two different concepts — concurrency and parallelism.
I came across concurrency when I was trying to download ~5000 images from the web. I had collected image URLs from Flickr, and these images had to be passed on to a team doing annotation (labelling).
This is how a sequential program to download images would look like:

I can post all the design considerations here and will receive feedbacks which will help me (and maybe other people) a lot.
The problem is that I cannot think of any ideas about software/applications that are not only practical but also useful for real-life use cases. Simple case studies are good but I'm afraid of that the readers will lose the interest. So any suggestion would be welcome and appreciate.

Dependencies are services or objects that the class needs to perform its function

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today in this digital era developing a web application requires a reliable and dependable software stack. Modern-day developers are utilizing a blend of advanced technologies to get swifter and enhanced outcomes through their projects.
Increasing the use of MEAN Stack is one of the primary examples of this scenario. MEAN JS is utilized to craft robust and scalable web applications. Let’s explore what exactly is Mean Stack and how it can assist your business.
What is the MEAN stack?
Mean stack is the compilation and synergy of technologies applied to build web applications. MEAN is used by several Web App Development Companies, and it precisely stands for “MongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js.”
How does Mean stack architecture work?

The Mean Stack Architecture works in five stages.
Stage 1: Angular as a client-side language is the foremost one to work on the client request.
Stage 2: The client request then goes into NodeJS being the JavaScript server-side language.
Stage 3: ExpressJS is then into the process and makes a database request.
Stage 4: Then MongoDB retrieves the data and sends the response to ExpressJS.
Stage 5: NodeJS returns the data to the AngularJS to showcase the outcomes, and in return, the data is taken back from the ExpressJS.

This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating your Angular application using Routers. We'll learn the basics of Router outlets, navigations, routes, and paths to generate a complete Angular Single Page Application (SPA).  
For you to be able to follow this tutorial along, it'll be a necessity to have basic knowledge of Angular.
Angular Router is a core part of Angular that aids in building a single-page application. It's located in the @angular/router package.  
It has a complete routing library for constructing multiple route outlets. It also supports several features such as lazy loading and routing guards for access control et cetera.
Routes are objects. At the lowest level, they comprise Angular components and paths, and sometimes redirectTo. This provides …]]></summary>

One of these greeters is the previously known as lightdm webkit2 greeter, then named lightdm web greeter, a greeter that allows theming with web technologies like HTML and JavaScript.
Sadly, this greeter was abandoned as Antergos team didn’t have time to develop their distro. The latest version, 2.2.5 uses an outdated WebKit engine, which could cause some new web technologies to not work in the greeter. Also, the Debian package is not working, a shame.
Luckily, Antergos team were developing a 3.0.0 version, getting rid of WebKit and using the QtWebEngine, based on Chromium, with Python. So, I decided to update some things about this greeter based on this pre-release.
Whither is the “new” tool that 3.0.0 would be using, developed by Antergos, allows to create web applications in a similar way to Electron.js, but in Python.
So, I’m here to introduce a new pre-release. You can install it from the GitHub Repository. Though, you need to install the whither sdk to run it.
Command line arguments support, such as —-help, —-theme, —-debug and others
Some fixes with the LightDM API, as power functions didn’t work
Man pages updated
Every local request is made through web-greeter:/ url scheme
WebKit no longer here. Replaced with Chromium
Some API changes. 2.2.5 deprecated functions and globals were removed
If you are using LightDM, I recommend you to use this greeter, try some themes and create your own!

However, I want to start moving to Linux (Ubuntu) which I installed on my PC a while back, so, I recently tried making a new file ("extensionless"), and I wanted to make it a different type, so I tested to see if that would work by testing by renaming it .go, so I could try to open it in VSCode like I normally would on WIndows.
I look up multiple searches, involving how to change the file extension (only getting results using command line), and eventually coming over to a horrifying S.O. answer that horrified me, it gave me the info that "extensions" (file types) are determined by header.
There doesn't seem to be any way in the "Files" file manager for Ubuntu to change the header type.

What I want is a program that can give me a simple GUI to edit the file type of a file so I can easily go between one or the other as needed/wanted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata]]></summary>
