Measure twice and cut once.

We wanted the absolute best developer experience for the users. So, we settled after a few trials on a process that worked well for us.
I set up working sessions between the component dev and myself.
Every component started with its own markdown file to document the design.
We put down the ideal developer usage and experience, for the component.
We referenced our existing version, component tickets history and industry leaders.
The states and interactions were then considered.
Once satisfied, we sought feedback from the rest of the dev team.
We also sought the feedback of some key dev community members.
The final design would then be honed, ready for coded implementation.

This week's review is "multi" in nature in the sense that we have news about privacy, security, cyber-attack_, and vulnerabilities.
Let's go!
Microsoft thwarts record‑breaking DDoS attack


DDoS is short for Distributed Denial of Service attacks and its main objective is to overwhelm a target infrastructure with more than it can handle on a typical day.
In this article, Amer Owaida of welivesecurity details how Microsoft thwarted a DDoS attack against an Azure customer.

As a new engineering manager, your first 90 days are crucial . You quickly realize the need to gain trust while rapidly building relationships and rapport — not only with your colleagues and your direct reports, but also with all the other discipline stakeholders. As an engineer, you spend 80% of your time with your engineering team, focusing on the engineering aspects of your role. But in a management position, you spend perhaps 50% of your time with your fellow engineers. The other 50% of your time is spent with people who are stakeholders representing cross-functional disciplines such as product, design + UX or the QA department if there is one.
In addition, there are other teams like people ops, recruiting, platf…]]></summary>

Someone was smiling behind the scene and was whispering not so easy boy! Prepare for the next hurdle.

Modern applications base more and more on micro-services. Splitting large applications into smaller pieces makes the whole more maintainable and easier to develop. However, instead of developing a big monolith, we work on a bunch of tiny applications, making it more challenging to debug and deploy the whole system. Luckily, there are many tools out there to help us out. An interesting comparison of some of them can be found here. In what follows, we want to see how easy it is to do Kubernetes-based development with devspace.
Suppose we are developing a micro-services application, for example an e-shop. In essence, our e-shop consists of a frontend application that communicates with a backend through an API. For the sake of simplicity, let's say …]]></summary>

One of the main points that came up -after settling for React, the lingua franca framework at our company- is how we would handle state management. Our main application uses Redux, but many other alternatives were brought up: MobX, using native hooks (a combination of useReducer + useContext), using Redux plus Redux Toolkit.

what would be a good way to categorize secrets?
Take a look at this:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = A3T6AKIAFJKR45SAWS5Z
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = hjshnk5ex5u34565d4654HJKGjhz545d89sjkjak

and this:
connect_to_db(host="136.12.43.86", port=8130, username="root", password="m42ploz2wd")

You can spot the difference: the first one is tied to a well identified service, AWS, while for the second, things are a bit blurrier: we immediately understand that it has to do with a database connection, but, without further context it doesn't tell us what doors it opens.
That's the most basic distinction we can make when scanning source code: some secrets…]]></summary>

A full-fledged Docker installation on WSL2
Docker Daemon automatic start without any crazy hacks
Docker Daemon sharing between Windows and WSL (i.e. you cannot run docker from Windows PowerShell)
Docker Daemon sharing between WSL distributions
I will consider that you already have WSL2 working, and you are using Ubuntu as your distribution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Programming is just one big cycle. Create or download a project, install your dependencies, build something amazing, and move on to the next one. However, with node.js projects, there's a glaring problem.
Every time you move on to another project, you leave incredible amounts of data in the node_modules folder that you may never use again. This can add up... quite quickly.

Don't despair! There's an easy fix, and it's called npkill.
 / 
        npkill
      
    

  











Easily find and remove old and heavy node_modules folders ✨



  


This tool allows you to list any node_modules directories in your system, as well as the space they take up. You can then select which ones you want to erase to free up space. Yay!

Clear space: Get rid of old and dusty node_modules cluttering up your machine.
Very fast: NPKILL is written in TypeScript, but searches are performed at a low level, improving performance greatly.
Easy to use: Say goodbye to lengthy commands. Using npkill is as simple as reading a list of your node_modules, and pressing Del to get rid of them. Could it be any easier? ;)
Minified: It barely has any dependencies.
You don't really need to install it to use it…
View on GitHub
It's an easy CLI that provides a user friendly interface to scroll through all of your node_modules folders, and, if necessary, delete some at the click of the button.
Personally, I think it's an incredibly cool and useful tool, and I'm sure you will too! To get started, just type:
npx npkill

And start freeing space!]]></summary>

There are many ways to avoid relative imports in Node.js. One of them is either:
Add NODE_PATH=./ env ( reference )
Set "baseUrl" in (js|ts)config.json ( reference )
Use require.main.require ( reference )
Directly write into node_modules ( reference )
Use NPM/Yarn workspaces  ( reference )
There are many downsides to each approach.
Adding an environment variable requires adding cross-env NODE_PATH=./ to all package.json scripts and every time you need to run the script yourself. This behavior is also somewhat unreliable during my testing, also VSCode Int…]]></summary>

All modern motherboards come equipped with an integrated RAID controller, and top models may have several such controllers on board. That’s a different question, though, if such integrated controllers in consumer-class motherboards are ever used by an average user. Anyway, some motherboards do give a chance to setup a RAID array right inside your home PC.

However, the web development industry is rapidly evolving, and developers no longer need to rely on JavaScript to create high-end online apps. Blazor is making it possible to run.NET in the browser without the need for add-ons or plugins, due to a technique called WebAssembly.
This blog will examine the current status of Blazor, its features, and its preparedness for production use, before comparing it to one of the most popular frameworks, Angular.

Hello everyone, my name is Dustin. Today, I wanted to talk about the experience of refactoring my entire code written in Nodejs and rewriting history in Git.
To be honest, I didn't think that it would be that difficult until I broke the whole thing. I literally had to rewrite everything from scratch. I mean not everything but everything. So first off, I had to create a readPath class which mainly will get the path from main to check if it is a folder or other files: .txt, .md, or .json so that I can use different method for different file types. After that, I need a produceFile class, which is going to help me in creating html file and a produceFolder class, which just helps me create a folder in the root directory where the user is sitting at. 
Before using classes
here
After using classes
here
And the code is well organized and easy to read even if for beginners who are used to object-oriented programming.
Thanks to the assignment, I got a chance to learn more about rebasing, amending as well as using classes in Javascript.

awk is a powerfull command line tool found included in all modern GNU/linux distributions. It is often excluded from beginner level Linux tutorials, where more fundamental commands like cd , pwd, ls etc are given more priority, and rightfully so.

awk in essence is a pattern scanning and processing language, emphasis on the language part because awk possesses functionality akin to most mainstream programming languages. 
awk loves tabulated data. So to begin with, you'll need a piece of text represented as columns delimited by some common character. You see this pattern often in shells, for instance, the ls -l command that prints file information delimited by a space :

DevOps is now the default approach to agile software development and deployment in most tech companies. With the promise of speed and quality, it seamlessly integrates the functions of development and operations teams to ensure that applications can be continuously pushed out to production. However, the emphasis on speed often comes at the cost of security. Critical vulnerabilities are addressed only late in development, with security patches often being tacked on right before deployment. This is where DevSecOps, also known as Secure DevOps, comes in.
Simply put, DevSecOps is the future of DevOps. DevSecOps involves integrating application security testing earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This notion of shifting security to the left is commonly cal…]]></summary>

Typescript is a strongly typed programming language like Java or C and typescript compiles into javascript so that we can use it in our browser or other platforms.

Typescript provides a complete type system so that ide/text editors eg.vs code can give you better autocompletion on your whole project and increase your productivity.

Typescript is better tool to use when you are comfortable with javascript and need more control over your codebase and want to catch silly mistake on compile-time rather than runtime.]]></summary>

The best way to increase functionality is through APIs; i.e. email contact forms, processing of outside data, or present information like the weather forecast, flight schedules, currency exchange rates etc. How would we make these API integrations quickly and securely if we do not want to build out a backend or add infrastructure to handle these API calls? Where do we secure the private API keys? What if we don't want user authentication prior to allowing our users to interact with the 3rd party APIs?

Now after this implementation, if I made check in code, if the meta tag is added then worked. Even, if I inspect in browser I can see the meta tag in script.

The destroyAfterEach Angular testing module teardown option addresses several long-standing issues when using the Angular testbed:
The host element is not removed from the DOM until another component fixture is created
Component styles are never removed from the DOM
Application-wide services are never destroyed
Feature-level services using the any provider scope are never destroyed
Angular modules are never destroyed
Components are destroyed 1 time less than the number of tests
Component-level services are destroyed 1 time less than the number of tests
The two first issues have the biggest impact when using Karma which runs the component tests in a browser.

A very clever malware designed with 3 components: - trojanized applications, - backdoors, and - rootkits. 🐞
It employs a rootkit to conceal its presence and uses different command and control servers for each sample, maintaining a low profile on your system as if nothing is happening will it cause havoc.
It is designed to launch and mediate access to a local SSH server, update itself, and transmit collected credentials. 🔒
FontOnLake is capable of file manipulation, updating itself, and uploading and downloading files
It accepts remote connections, serves as a proxy and can download and run Python scripts, in addition to exfiltrating credentials.
Surprisingly, this malware targets the one who is immune to most viruses, Linux
And the most scary part is that, it is still under development (and it is this deadly ☠️)

Overview of AngularJS

It is undoubtedly a largely used JavaScript framework that allows you to execute client web apps in browsers and create native apps. Angular apps consist of various components written with TypeScript or JavaScript. These are decorated with directives for handling things such as binding the HTML or markup to data. Your codes written with Angular will not run directly on web browsers. Therefore, you need compilers to change your code to something which the browsers can easily run.

Bu hata ile karşı karşılaşanlar genelde aşağıdaki iki komutu çalıştırdığında karşılaşmakta:
hostnamectl
timedatectl
Komutlar çalıştırıldığında ise aşağıdaki gibi bir output döndürmekteler.

Bu sorunu çözebilmek için öncelikle dbus adlı servisin çalıştığından emin olunmalıdır.
systemctl status dbus

Eğer bu komut sonrası dönüt aşağıdaki gibi ise servisin bulunmadığını söylemektedir.

Bu durumda aşağıdaki komut ile servis yüklenir:
apt install dbus

Sonrasında servis otomatik olarak active hale gelmiş olabilir. Yine de kesinlik kazandırmak için servisi başlatmalı ve "enable" hale getirmeliyiz. Böylelikle makine her başladığında çalışır duruma gelebilmektedir.
systemctl start dbus
systemctl enable dbus

Eğer "systemctl status dbus" komutunun dönütü aşağıdaki gibi ise servis bulunmakta fakat aktif olmadığı anlamına gelmektedir.

Servis aktif edilir:
systemctl start dbus

Böylelikle dbus servisi sorunu çözümlenmiş olur. Eğer bu işlemlere rağmen çözüm sağlanılmamış ise bunun sebebi /var/run ile /run arasındaki gerekli symbolic linkin bozulmuş olması olabilir. Bunun için aşağıdaki komutlar çalıştırılır ve servisin durumuna bakılır:
sudo rm /var/run -R
sudo ln -s /run /var
sudo reboot]]></summary>
