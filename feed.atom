        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Custom software development is a lot of things, but you’d be hard pressed to find a way to describe it as “easy”.
It takes a lot of planning and resources. Often you need a team to make it happen. Technology is changing at an incredible rate, so you need to get serious about adopting a methodology too.
There’s risks and rewards and, like everything else, you celebrate the wins and learn from the mistakes.
But one of the things experienced in all areas of software development, from business owners to junior developers and everyone in between, is the nagging, gut-wrenching feeling of uncertainty.
Sometimes it hits you in a coding sprint or maybe in the middle of a planning meeting. Maybe it even keeps you up at night as you’re reflecting on the day.
Regardless of when or how it happens, ever…]]></summary>

Token security and ESLint in Angular | Philippe De Ryck & James Henry
Can an Angular application store tokens in localStorage?
– Yes, of course! LocalStorage is persistent storage, so the token is available to all tabs and windows. It even survives a browser restart.
– No, absolutely not! LocalStorage is insecure, and an attacker will be able to steal the token.
Believe it or not, but both answers are correct. As simple as this question is, the answer is far fr…]]></summary>

The last time I wanted to publish a npm package was in 2018. It was a React library which provided Components for creating Forms. It wasn’t straight forward to publish such a library back then. There were so many things to handle on your own, especially when it came to TypeScript.
Assuming you were already familiar with webpack you thought: ha that should be easy, I can leverage my knowledge and just bundle my library with webpack, exactly like my webapps. But then you suddenly heard of that new kid on the block: Rollup, which seems to do a better job at bundling libraries. So a new bundler you had to learn and still soo many things to take care of on your own.

Part 3 (this one) - what is Reactive Programming all about?
The name React is already declaring that it is used in reactive programming, but what is that? Wikipedia is defining it as "a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change". It expands on that to say that it declares the relationship between elements and updates them when either change. You can easily imagine a graph of elements magically updating as any of them changes. However, the implementation details of that magic matter.

In one of the applications that I'm working on, I have to calculate what is a previous month of a given date. It seems easy, isn't it? Golang provides the time package which has a method: AddDate.  
I'm quite fresh in Go, previously I was working with C#, Python and (for some time) TypeScript. Every one of these languages has also some methods to calculate time. Let's see how they work.
Let's use System.DateTime.AddMonths:

Programatically sending requests in Node.js can be a frustrating experience. First, you have to choose one out of many request libraries in the ecosystem. Second, they each have a slightly different API which is confusing when you're switching.
You also have to make sure the request is formatted in a specific way for the 3rd party on the receiving end to accept it.
Just as you're starting to get the hand of axios, you soon find out there are (subtle) usage differences depending on whether you're in the browser or Node.js.
What a pain.
Only if sending files with axios in Node.js would be as easy as taking a walk in the park.
Well, it can be.

Modern software and system architectures encourage the decoupling of different layers/services in an application's design. These services and/or layers can be web service APIs, database systems, cache proxy servers, serverless functions, etc. Communication between these elements is done by sending data in the form of messages from one point to another, oftentimes asynchronously. In this post, we will look at one of the tools that helps broker messages between the layers and services in these architectures and ensure that messages are transferred at a rate that can be handled by the intended destination service/layer.
A message queue is a component in a system's architecture that helps buffer and distribute asynchronous requests. As stated earlier, a message is sent in a requ…]]></summary>

While Deno has a lot to offer, such as built-in TypeScript support and a simpler dependency system, the biggest hurdle to its adoption is the plethora of dev tools and frameworks that are dependent on Node.js. As Deno gains traction, however, developers have begun creating new frameworks that rely on Deno instead of Node.js.

The Typeable Team appreciates security! We love Haskell, but is Haskell a good choice when secure software is the goal? We would love to say yes, but like most empirical questions about software development, there is simply no hard evidence that Haskell, or any general programming language, is more secure than any other. That is not to say that the Typeable's language choice doesn't matter in regards to security, but how it does may need to be elaborated.
After teaching introductory Software Security for half a decade I can attest that Software Security has no universal theory on which to rely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In part 1 of this post, we have made a Twitter bot that greets followers and people who like our tweets but it was dependent on our local machine. So, in this post let's get rid of it and push it on Heroku.
Heroku bestow the functionality to make a Node app a Worker which would run continuously as opposed to a Web app that would be put to sleep if not visited for a brief period of time.
Step-0: Make a Heroku app, then we can deploy the app using either Heroku CLI or attaching Github to it. Here, I am gonna use Heroku CLI.
Step-1: Add a Procfile to make our app a Worker. Simply make a file with the name Procfile add it to the root and add the following code in it:
worker: npm start

And modify the start script to "start": "node bot.js"
Step-2: Push the app to heroku by following the steps: 
Install Git form here

Install Heroku CLI from here



  
  
  Commit your changes using Git




  cd myapp
  git init
  Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
  git add .
  git commit -m "My first commit"


Then create a Heroku app using heroku create twitter-bot-2021, this would also add a remote to you repository. Check the remote using git remote -v. This should show a Herko remote.


Now open the app by login in to the Heroku in order to put environment variables there as we cannot push .env file for security reasons.


Get the app URL by opening up the app using open app option from inside the app dashboard.


Then go to settings and click on Reveal Config Vars and insert the environment variables present in your .env file.


Now, finally deploy the code to Heroku using git push heroku master:main, if you are on the main branch in your local git repo then simply do git push heroku main.


Checkout these docs related to deployment in case you are stuck somewhere. 


Check the dashboard of the app, it should show a successful build in green.


Now, finally check the bot by following it form some other account, you should get the DM from the bot.

And you have done it.]]></summary>

At Supermetrics one error-handling approach we take is to encode error states into the TypeScript type system. What does this mean? Simply, I’m referring to code where the semantic property of "being an error" is indicated by a variable's type. For a simplified example:
// No information in the type that this is an error,
// you would have to inspect the value to check
let firstError: string = "Something terrible occurred";

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I started writing code, I used Notepad and Notepad++. When I switched to OS X. In my first computer science class in high school we used Visual Studio.
When I finally migrated to Linux, I started using vi/vim after using nano for a while. Unlike nano, vim is a lot more powerful but is harder to learn.
How did I go from never using vim to using it all the time? How does one make a complete switch? I'll walk you through how I got here and share some tips along the way.
If you are trying to learn Vim, or you are on the fence about it, here are my top 5 reasons why I love this keyboard-centered editor:
The more I used it, the faster I became, and the faster I became the more productive I was.


It's everywhere. Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and every other operating system supports Vi/Vim. 


I don't like to use my mouse. I never did anything in Sublime Text without the help of my mouse. This is a annoying, easier to keep hands on the keyboard


It can be used over the network using ssh. Login to any box and use it.


I use it for almost everything: programming, writing, blogging, etc.




Switching is up to you, but here are my reasons.
Why would somebody use ancient tools like vi/vim when there are so many modern ones out there? 
One day I had to answer this question for my friend. He asked, “Why don’t you use Sublime Text like me?” I explain to him that sometimes it’s better to use older/simpler tools than more complex ones.
Here are my reasons:
Learn how to use the best editor ever made.
Never get lost in a sea of menus and toolbars that you never use (just like vim does not have any).
Have an excuse to use powerful, built-in commands that are available in no other editor (and are faster than anything you can do with a GUI).
Work fast using commands

Starter template for a React app - including docs and deploys to GitHub Pages








Note that this project will not be up to date in terms of structure as dependencies, in comparison to the original Create React App repo was is used to generate the code for this repo.
So you may prefer to generate a fresh app using the command below from the Getting Started guide.
$ npx create-react-app my-app
$ cd my-app
$ yarn start
Then add the docs and CI setup based on this React Quickstart template repo.
To install, run and deploy the app, see this project's docs:

To learn how to use this project and see how a React project works - see the About page of the template's notes.
…

  
View on GitHub
You'll see imports are done like this:
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

That requires dependencies like react to be specified in package.json and installed using:
$ npm install

As per the Usage doc in the docs directory, use one of:
$ yarn start

$ npm start

This Node project is good for beginners in JavaScript who have little experience in React or Node and want to learn more.
Or, maybe you make a lot of React projects already but want to standardize your process. Or you want to add some docs and CI to your project and get it deployed to GitHub Pages.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals (or windows), each running a separate program, to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. 
tmux may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached. 
It allows you to easily manage separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window. 
tmux can connect to a server, and multiple clients can be connected to the same session, simultaneously exchanging their input and display.

You can use these commands and shortcuts to work with tmux in Linux. From the command line:



Session Control





tmux
Start a new session


tmux new -s 
Start a new session with the name chosen


tmux ls
List all sessions






Pane Control





Ctrl b, "
Split pane horizontally


Ctrl b, %
Split pane vertically


Ctrl b, o
Next pane



I've used tmux for years, and it has become an essential part of my work flow. I couldn't imagine editing code without it. If you want to practice Linux commands, you can use these exercises 
tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.
Features include:
• Splitting a terminal window into horizontal or vertical panes.

tmux is very useful for people who commonly work on remote machines via ssh.
Why did I pick tmux over screen and a terminal multiplexer? Three reasons.
First, tmux is written is responsive and light.
Second, tmux is much more expressive than screen. I can split my terminal into six panes and change the size of each pane with the same ease as resizing a terminal in GNU Screen.
Third, tmux has integrated support for a status bar. This means I can read from one pane and keep an eye on other panes at the same time.]]></summary>

As such, Amazon gives you four methods to encrypt objects in Amazon S3.

The second one is SSE-KMS. It leverages AWS key management service to manage your encryption keys.

Don't vendor lock yourself with unsupported experimental syntax and
reflect-metadata which forces you to pre-process your runtime code.
Use raw vanilla Javascript and infer Typescript data types directly from the Javascript definitions.

  name: nonNullable(stringType())

@Model()
class userModel 
  @Field()

First of all we need to know Typescript decorators API.
Decorators are syntax sugar which gives us the option to write quasi high-order-functions to enhance classes, methods, and properties.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is one of the strange problems of VirtualBox which drives me crazy until I figured out, how simple the solution was.
If you are running from the same problem, don't worry. Just make sure you are using the right installer for your distribution/OS
By the way, Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6 (>=2.28) or libc6 (>=2.29) is referred to as the same problem
OK, Let me explain a bit further,  A few months ago I was wanted to install VirtualBox on my Linux Mint computer, So, I went to the VirtualBox Official website (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads) but I won't found the installer for Linux Mint Version there ( It's still not present here as you can see in the picture below)

So, I choose  Ubuntu 19.10 / 20.04 / 20.10 / 21.04 from the available list because I knew Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu. so, whatever works on Ubuntu should be work on Linux Mint as well. It was not a big deal. But in the installation, it just won't worked and threw this Dependency is not satisfiable: libc6 (>=2.28) error.

At that moment I reconsider my OS. I was using Linux Mint 19.3 Cinnamon. OS version placed a critical role here. I simply Googled "Linux Mint 19.3 Ubuntu Version"  and found Mint 19.3 is based on Ubuntu 18.04 . 
I revisit the download page and download it again but now from the  Ubuntu 18.04 / 18.10 / 19.04  option and run the installer and Guess what, It was running absolutely fine without any issue. Through the installer required some extra dependency, not an issue, just allowed it

Maybe you downloaded the Debian 10 version installer, not working.. then download it for Debian 9. Fedora 33/34 not working... download it for Fedora 32. Just make sure that the VirtualBox installer is compatible with your OS version :)

Myth #1: Steep Learning Curve in Angular

One of the famous misleading opinions we observe among people especially on Twitter and youtube gurus is ‘Angular has a steep learning curve’. The short answer is yes, Angular has not a small road to learning and master. But let’s first analyze the definition of this concept. A steep learning curve refers to: ‘The amount of time required to learn is big’. Interesting but what makes it BIG? First, let’s point out Angular is a fully-featured framework.

Continuing on from my previous blog about website security week, we're going to talk about a validation.
If accept user input, you are going to need to validate the input. Non validated user inputs can lead to security vulnerabilities for example SQL injection attacks, where user input escapes your database and starts modifying it. It can also lead to exceptions from your code if a user inputs text rather than a number for example.
Please Please Please ensure you do the same validation server side as you do on the frontend (client) side.



You user inputs should be contained in HTML forms which comes with lots of powerful validation tools built in.

Anyway, not all hackers are cybercriminals. White hats or "ethical hackers" use their skills to test and ultimately improve security for various organizations and people. For example, banks and medical services can be involved.
They use the same techniques as gray and black hats to infiltrate systems. Black hats are known for their dark intentions. I would describe gray hats as "not always ethical hackers." Sometimes, they do illegal stuff.

The Typescript experimental decorators were based on TC39 proposal-decorators.
We use the same Decorators in our Angular codebase to create services, components and other Angular constructs.
But the same TC39 proposal has evolved in a different direction which is semantically not compatible with the experimental Typescript decorators.   
The new spec for Decorators is easier to use and write.
You can find the detailed comparison between old and new decorators here. 
Just finished up the first draft of the new decorators spec, pretty excited about it 😄 https://t.co/ELhZbsiaiR

Does this mean that Typescript experimental decorators will not be compatible with Javascript decorators 😨
— Shivam (@shivamd20

Unfortunately no, the new proposal has differing semantics from previous proposals in a number of ways. TypeScript experimental decorators were also incompatible with the Define semantics class fields, which caused a decent amount of breakage in the ecosystem.

When the proposal advances, figuring out a step-by-step incremental upgrade path for existing decorators users is definitely going to be a priority though! No user left behind 😄

Let's just hope that this doesn’t result in fragmentation of JavaScript decorators. We have already faced a lot inconvenience due to commonsjs and ES6 imports.]]></summary>

I wanted to something fun for the holiday season, so I decided to port a variable-width stroke from the Flex Freehand Drawing Library I created back in the early 2010’s. This stroke actually has a venerable history, going back to about 1983, as an exercise I was assigned as a teaching assistant for a graduate course in computational geometry. The instructor’s company recently obtained a very expensive tablet. This system allowed users to scan or load drawings already in electronic form into a display and annotate them with hand-drawn notes using a fixed-width stroke. The instructor had an idea for a variable-width (speed-dependent) stroke that would be the basis for a number of lab exercises. My job was to get his idea working in Fortran (yes, now you ca…]]></summary>

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
