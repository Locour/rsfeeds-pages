  https://blog.flashdrive.io/create-and-host-a-blog-using-gatsby-and-ghost-headless-cms/ 



At FlashDrive.io, we use every day and love modern, static frameworks like Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll, and others.
Gatsby, with its huge community and user base, is the first framework to have a complete build add-on developed on FlashDrive, and we love playing with Gatsby every day.
It's also great that Gatsby comes with a large set of plugins to connect with various CMS like WordPress, Ghost, etc.
In this post, we'll see why it's popular (and actually a good idea) to mix a dynamic CMS like WordPress with a static website generator like Gatsby.
The main advantage to this setup is that you will keep WordPress what it does best: providing a good CMS with a ton of features and integration. Then use Gatsby to deliver a static version of your content without any risk of a hacked plugin and the ability to handle massive traffic even on small configurations like Dev (or ideally Web) FlashDrive instances.
We will install WordPress, add the GraphQL plugin, and install and Gatsby on FlashDrive.io to create a static website that rebuilds automatically each time your website is modified, all of that using FlashDrive's unique network and security capabilities and only using FREE dev instances on FlashDrive!
FlashDrive.io is Free for developers, register today to try Gatsby with WordPress for free.]]></summary>

If you're a developer, it's important for you to have a personal portfolio website – especially when you're applying for jobs.
After a few months of development, I have finally put together a multi-themed website that will greatly increase your chances of getting attention from recruiters.
Here is a link to my portfolio - https://www.adrinlol.com/
You can download the source code by going here - https://adrinlol.gumroad.com/l/cHsGL
You will find a detailed documentation inside the README fille on how to setup, make changes and run this website.
This template has several API calls, that is handled by the SWR (stale-while-revalidate), the list includes: 
Medium's API to display my personal articles in this project.


Spotify's API to show the current track as well as display my top 20 songs of the week. 


GitHub's API to highlight most popular of my open-source projects.




  
  
  Technology stack


As for the technologies, here is a full list of libraries I'm using for this project:
Next.js


styled-components


swr


react-transition-group




  
  
  Lighthouse results


It should come with no surprise that Next.js coupled with SWR is blazing fast, and the results are no surprise.]]></summary>

Pues a hora pienso diferente, estoy en un momento de mi vida que veo el fallar como parte del proceso. Claro siempre intentando prever los problemas, pero sabiendo que por más que uno se prepare la tempestad vendrá mas tarde o temprano.
Actualmente tengo tres ideas de proyecto, entonces pensé en crear una arquitectura que se pueda pivotar sin afectar otras cosas ya desarrolladas.
Preguntas que me venían:
Como puedo construir un proyecto que se pueda reutilizar por diferentes proyectos?
Como puedo construir un micro servicio separando la reglas de negocio con la tecnología?
Como puedo comunicar mis microservicio de forma rápida?
Y para informaciones que no tengo tanga urgencia, como gerencias grandes cuantidad de mensajes de forma distribuida?
Como puedo multiplicar micro servicios si aumenta mi demanda?
Después de pensar mucho, llegue a esta arquitectura, onde cada microservice esta contenido en un Docker, y todo gestionado por el Kubernetes.

Voy a dejar el Kubernetes por ultimo, por a hora me voy a focar en crear los microservicios conversando por una camada intermediaria llamada Protocol Action. 
Un micro servicio ya esta disponible, dale estrellita y fork, eso me ayuda mucho. :)

Cryptography has its origins in the ancient world. Some say it was born in Egypt through the hieroglyphs used to hide messages for only the aristocratic literate scribes could read them. It was also found in Greece through scytales, which were used in battle to pass messages. A sender would tightly wind a leather strip around a stick and write a message that would span across the wound strips, unravel the leather and send it off.

All was going according to plan until we had a meeting with the backend team, and Connor, one of the engineers, set us up for a surprise: "We have been thinking and discussing this for a while, and we consider that the best solution we can offer you is to build a GraphQL server you can use to query and mutate the data".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brief insight on containers and VMs
Operating Systems keep track of memory, RAM, Disk and devices, and if you run multiple programs simultaneously, all these resources of OS will be shared among the programs as per their requirements.
Now let's take an example where  1 of your programs is using port 80 and another program too needs to run on the same port, and if it tries to use the port, it will crash because port 80 is already in use.
It is one such example where containers and VMs come in use.
If you move your programs into containers or VMs each of them will have its own version of shared resources, files and network ports.
Containers provide the mobility, you can move and run your application easily.
Let's take a scenario where you are working on an application on your machine. Now that application will have certain configurations, binaries and other files and if you ship the same application and try to run it on another machine, it won't run if the machine does not fulfills the configuration requirements as per the application's demand of it. But if you have containerized it and then ship, no such issue will arise.
There are some similarities and so many differences between containers and VMs
Let's see that in the next post.
Enough of containers and stuff, let me make one revelation about you, You look best when you smile xD.]]></summary>

so you want to expose some of your queries (but not all!) to public users, so that users can use/interact with your app before having to sign up.  Makes sense!!
Well, it's a royal PITA.
Set your Appsync API to be protected by IAM



Create a Cognito identity pool, and create a role for unauthenticated users:



For the unauthenticated role, specifically assign the fields/types you want.



If you'd like to be confused by AWS' documentation of how to do this, start here, or here.
Alternatively, you can copy this template where I give access to two subscriptions only:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "appsync:GraphQL",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:appsync:*:*:apis/*/types/*/fields/onCreateOrders",
                "arn:aws:appsync:*:*:apis/*/types/*/fields/onUpdateOrders"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

Finally, in our JS code, I use the Amplify SDK, so here's how I configure that:
const config = awsRealtimeConfig: {
        aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint: "https://<graphql-id>.appsync-api.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/graphql",
        aws_appsync_region: "<region>",
        aws_appsync_authenticationType: 'AWS_IAM',
        Auth: {
            identityPoolId: 'us-east-2:pool-id-here',
            region: 'us-east-2',
        }
    },

Amplify.configure(config)]]></summary>

After, finish project setup on prompt:
Set the project name
Set the project description

A voice-controlled virtual assistant is one step ahead of the legacy Touch-Tone/DTMF controlled one because of the flexibility it allows end users. They can just speak into their phone’s microphone to provide input to control the call.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this simple tutorial, I will be explaining how to configure your windows subsystem for Linux efficiently and optimize your WSL performance when you're running applications through them.
 Everyone has widespread access to windows but they may or maynot be savvy enough to run their favorite flavour of linux due to various constraints
WSL2 really makes life easy for those devs who can't access linux through a cloud provider or locally run it on their devices.
WSL has support for various distros like Debian, Arch and Ubuntu.
Now coming to the interesting part, windows has all access to the CPU and memory resources in your device and it is built in a way which will optimize the resource utilization but how do you limit your linux subsystem, let  us say you'd like to manipulate the configuration to suit your needs the best, then you should follow these steps.
Shut your current running instance of WSL using this command
wsl --shutdown

Run this command through powershell as administrator
Create a configuration file for WSL on your user profile directory
notepad "$env:USERPROFILE\.wslconfig"

 This is the most important step in this project, so please follow carefully 
The following parameters define their corresponding resources:
CPU  = > cores dedicated to WSL
Memory  = > RAM allocated to WSL
AutoMount  = > Mount your default NTFS drive to your subsystem
Boot => defines your booting options for services
Kernel  = > Custom kernel for linux
LocalhostForwarding  = > for port-forwarding your applications running on localhost
My configuration for CPU and memory:
[wsl2]
memory=9GB  
processors=4

This is how you can configure your resources for WSL 😀. Feel free to leave some comments down below⬇️.
You can read this document for the reference]]></summary>

I'm talking about the implementation, not the TypeScript part.
type Observer<T> = (payload: T) => void;

export interface Publer<T> {
  subscribe<K extends keyof T>(
    channel: K,
    observer: Observer<T[K]>,
  ): () => void;
  unsubscribe<K extends keyof T>(channel?: K): void;
  publish<K extends keyof T>(
    channel: K,
    ...a: T[K] extends undefined ? [] : [T[K]]
  ): void;
}

export const publer = <T>(): Publer<T> => {
  const eventMap = new Map<keyof T, Set<Observer<any>>>();

  return {
    subscribe: (channel, observer) =>
      (eventMap.get(channel)?.add(observer) ||
        eventMap.set(channel, new Set([observer]))) &&
      (() => eventMap.get(channel)?.delete(observer)),
    unsubscribe: (channel) =>
      channel ? eventMap.get(channel)?.clear() : eventMap.clear(),
    publish: (channel, ...[payload]) =>
      eventMap.get(channel)?.forEach((observer) => observer(payload)),
  } as const;
};

This is the smallest way I could come up with.
interface Events {
  login: { token: string }
}

const pubsub = publer<Events>();

const unsubscribe = pubsub.subscribe('login', ({ token }) => {
  // Payload is inferred based on the event name
})

// Payload is required based on event name
pubsub.emit('login', { token: "ABC" });

I would love to see what other ways to make it even smaller you guys think of. Cheers!]]></summary>

It's understandable, given that DevOps is still expanding, covers a wide range of topics, and is changed and accepted based on a company's individual business objectives, priorities, and current knowledge base. We'll attempt to present our own principle-based description of what DevOps is at the end of this article, but before we do, it's helpful to explore what DevOps is NOT, debunking some of the prevalent misconceptions about DevOps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Terraform is quite large. You have a lot of possibilities do to with, and here are some tips to help you with your scripts.
condition ? true_val : false_val

If quite simple, it looks like ternary condition in Java for example.
true_val will be used, otherwise it will be the false_val.
example
var.a != "" ? var.a : "default-a"

Terraform documentation : https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/expressions/conditionals.html
resource "xxx" "yyyy" {
  ....
  count            = "${var.a == "a" ? 1 : 0}"
}

To create some elements depending conditions, or to create multiple instances of a resource, we can use count.
Mixed with a conditional expression we can defined how much elements the script needs to create. So if you're defining a case were the script must create 0 instances, so you have a conditionnal resource.
Documentation : https://dev.to/tbetous/how-to-make-conditionnal-resources-in-terraform-440n
locals {
  service_name = "forum"
  owner        = "Community Team"

  name = "${var.env}-xxxx"
}

locals is an object with static values (which can't be overrided by variables) or can help to create some values from the variables inputs.
It can be really useful to avoid redefining a value in multiple resources.
Terraform documentation : https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/locals.html
I hope it will help you! 🍺]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firstly, this question had my attention, now it has my curiosity :) Since I dig into the full-stack monitoring niche, I would appreciate your opinion about the question above.
On the one hand, it's always convenient to have a single monitoring solution for several purposes, e.g. IT infrastructure monitoring, log management, synthetic monitoring, etc. It doesn't matter if your company is a startup or enterprise, the benefits of an all-in-one solution are obvious:
One place for monitoring, logging, user experience, etc., consequently, one console instead of multiple.


Observability. Explore why an application or system behaves in a certain manner.


Real-time metrics. Correlate application metrics, transaction metrics, and infrastructure metrics to see what’s going on in your apps.



Logically, such an option helps to save company's budget and manager's & DevOps mental health :)
But, on the other hand, the vast majority of people I know are sure that the existing B2B solutions are not always capable to face all the processes and produce expected results. I don't know why. Of course, we talk about solutions such as InsightCat, Elastic.co, Splunk, etc. The main argument is that "there is no decent “full stack” option".
Perhaps, it depends on the company budget and tech people's preferences. But, from my personal perspective, a single full-stack solution is a good option to think about, especially, if you have multiple clouds, SaaS, and a few hundred apps.
My company uses InsigthCat https://insightcat.com/ and we like it. So, I'm curious to know which side is preferable in your company and why.
Do you stick to all-in-one or splitting?
Thank you.]]></summary>

https://imgur.com/a/FZ5fICV
I am finishing up (cpt 103) microcomputers applications and (cpt 165) programming logic this semester. Next semester the academic advisor has me for (cpt 105) ethics in technology and (cpm 120) intro to multimedia (adobe creative cloud) but I wasn't sure if I should be knocking them out in order or not. The academic advisor said my course does not need to be followed exactly how this list is, and as long as there are no pre class requirements like some of the classes in the 200s, it should be fine.
I wasn't sure if just by looking at the titles of the classes if you guys think I should be taking other classes before the intro to multimedia, or if I am ok to take that class before basics of data communications and pc operating systems
Thanks so much!]]></summary>

If you, as an Engineer or Developer, ignore the networking part of Docker, you will miss out on arguably one of its most powerful capabilities.
But, before we understand "WHY" it's important, let's first answer...
A network is formed when a group of devices is connected over a medium to share data.
The devices (or computer systems) would be connected to the network by some form of physical or virtual interface. 
The medium could be wired or wireless, be it cables, telephone lines or radio waves, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[簡介


Cockpit 是一個由 Red Hat 所資助的開源軟體，做為一個 Linux 的 web 管理介面，讓我們可以用瀏覽器就能管理系統事務而無須動用男子漢的文字指令。
條列式 Cockpit 的功能與特色：
有美美的圖表即時顯示系統負載
顯示一些基本的軟硬體資訊
關機、重開機
顯示系統日誌
管理儲存空間
管理網路介面
管理帳戶
管理服務，不用碰 systemctl

內建終端機，Cockpit web 做不到的事可以在終端機做
模組化設計，可以安裝或自行開發擴充模組
以 Elementary OS / Ubuntu 來說，在出廠的 APT 庫已經內建了 Cockpit，所以只要一行即可裝起來：
sudo apt install cockpit

其它的 Linux 可以參閱 Cockpit 的安裝文件。
安裝之後 Cockpit 會以服務的形式在背景運作，服務的名稱就叫做 Cockpit Web Service。因為是服務，當然也會常態的佔據一部分的記憶體，有必要的話可以改成平時關閉，要用時再用 systemctl 把 Cockpit Web Service 叫起來。（不過我就是不想用 systemctl 來管服務才裝 Cockpit 的啊…）
另外在 Elementary OS / Ubuntu 的 APT 庫內還有一些模組可以安裝，包括 Docker 的管理等等的，可以自行選用。
Cockpit 會在本機的 9090 埠提供服務，所以只要 Cockpit Web Service 有啟動的狀態下，用瀏覽器開 http://localhost:9090/ 就會進到 Cockpit 的登入頁。

登入之後的各模組使用應該是一望即知，就不多做介紹了。
因為 Cockpit 是 web，所以就需要多考慮存取的控制，要禁止本機以外的機器存取到 Cockpit 的話，請在防火牆設定那邊確定沒有開放 9090 埠。
以 Elementary OS 為例，在 系統設定值 安全與隱私 防火牆 那邊可以做設定。

對 9090 埠做限制，禁止外部訪問，或只允許信任的 IP 訪問。]]></summary>

So around 3 months ago I switched to Linux from Windows 10. I have a very low end PC so Windows 10 was lagging a lot so I thought to switch to Linux. 
I definitely ran a lot better than windows. But after some time, It's UI also seemed a bit boring to me. So the I installed the KDE PLasma desktop environment on top of it. And I just loved it.
KDE has a lot of features and is very customizable
Very user friendly


Customisation
Noctis Round Theme




Keyboard Shortcuts


Addons 







System Wide Search
KDE has KRunner, which is a system wide search & its much faster than  Window's search. 

There are many other features in KDE that I like. 
Conclusion:


I just love KDE Plasma & its a great alternative for Windows. 
I am not switching back to Windows anytime soon.

This approach I'm going to outline probably won't be worth it for all use cases, so I'll focus on a solution for component libraries and design system monorepos that have many components that all share the same source code structure and therefore need the same core styles to use at dev/build time.

It is common for many server-side services, including web services, to output and record logs about the behavior of the service. By continuously outputting logs, they can be used for troubleshooting, debugging, responding to security incidents, auditing, and clues for performance improvement. The more information contained in the log, the more clues to solve problems, so it is useful to post as much information as possible (although there is a limit), or to be able to increase the amount of information through configuration.
On the other hand, however, there is some information that is undesirable to output on the server side.

However, at a general level it’s simply describing a set of steps done in a specific order to achieve the desired end result.
Workflow as code simply means that we’re using code to orchestrate and execute a workflow, very likely in a distributed environment. In the site reliability engineering (SRE) or cloud engineering space, these workflows tend to deal with things like cost savings and incident resolution.
In the early days of SRE (when it was still called DevOps), the ability to chain together specified actions with code was a much more daunting task. Let’s take what seems like a simple example: a da…]]></summary>

Here's a quick introduction/presentation so you know what this is and why you're reading it. I'm Merk, a Software Engineering student that really likes reverse engineering (among other things).
In this series we will attempt to reverse engineer and complete challenges from the Reversing.kr website. In this particular case, we will be reversing the password of the challenge Easy Crack.
We're given a Windows executable and must crack it. Using DIE we can see it is a 32-bit executable and is not packed.



We could straight up patch the program so that the flow of execution skips the error message and goes to the right place
This would be the cracker's way; not the reverser's, and would also not give us points since we don't reverse engineer the password ;)
We could look for string references
Given that the executable doesn't seem to have any protections, and knowing the string "Incorrect Password", this method can prove to be useful 
We could set a breakpoint on the Win32 API GetDlgItemText/A/W
Because of how the program window looks, it is very likely that the Dialog reads its content using this function
We'll test our luck looking for string references. Let's fire up x64dbg, attach the executable and look for strings in the main module.

"Congratulation !!" - the good boy
"Incorrect Password" - the bad boy




returns 1, and makes the flow end up executing the bad boy. Taking a look inside, we can see it compares [EBP+C] which contains "5y" with our string starting from the third letter, which is stored in ESI. This is done via "repe cmpsb", which essentially compares several characters.



return 0, and the flow of execution gets further into the program.

"R3versing" is stored in ESI before some comparisons.]]></summary>

So we are telling sed that go search for the word find then replace it with the word replace and what it does is it searches every lines for its first instance of the word find. So it not gonna replace every instances of find, only the first time it appears on each line from oldfile and then writes it to newfile.
Sometimes you want to replace every find in oldfile you just need to add global substitution g for every instances find.

I know there used to be a need for trackBy.
Experience has shown me little need for it's use recently.
Some quick research said that it is only needed if there are issues with performance with modern Angular.
So, I decided to test this out myself.
In my first iteration of testing, I tested loading data to see if there was a difference in load times when displaying them with and without the trackBy. Here are the first set of tests I ran that showed some hopeful results.

Reading the content of the page, at the first glance, it tells us that there is a query parameter called html, which is capable of define partially what's displayed to the user. When we define, for example, a <h1> tag to this parameter, we are going to get returned a page with this tag being reflected, which is already an HTML injection. From now on, we will be working to make it become an XSS.

If we simply try to inject something like <script>alert(document.domain);</script>, this script tag will be reflected, but the code itself will not be executed. Why? Well, if we look at the head of the page, we are going to find something interesting:

Imagine que você utilize uma API Rest de um serviço qualquer, seja ele criado internamente na empresa que você trabalha, seja ele de terceiros e que esse serviço ofereça um endpoint para homologação e outro para produção.
Uma abordagem inicial seria trocar os valores dessa api todas as vezes que quisermos publicar nossa aplicação em produção.
Uma abordagem muito mais elegante é configurar as variáveis de ambiente para que você não tenha que lembrar de trocar o conteúdo de nenhuma variável.
Aqui mostro como fazer isso utilizando o recurso de configuração de ambiente do Angular.
Projetos criados com Angular CLI possuem por padrão um arquivo de configuração chamado environment.ts disponível na pasta environments da sua aplicação.

environment.ts:
export const environment = {
  production: false
};

environment.prod.ts
export const environment = {
  production: true
};

Veja um exemplo de como usar o environment.
import { environment } from '../environments/environment';

environment = environment;

<div class="row justify-content-center" *ngIf="!environment.production">    
    <div class="auth-box text-center">

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we use Angular's schematics to generate components, unnecessary asynchronous code is added to the test setup hook for its test suite.
The following test setup is generated by Angular's component generation schematic:
beforeEach(async () => {
  await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  }).compileComponents();
});

component schematic.





Alternatively, we might be using Angular's waitForAsync test function wrapper (formerly named async) as seen in the following code snippet:
beforeEach(waitForAsync(() => {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  }).compileComponents();
}));

waitForAsync.





Here's the deal: It's only necessary to call the static TestBed.compileComponents method if we're not using the Angular CLI to run our tests (who would do such a thing, Google? 👈😏).
The Angular CLI compiles our application and tests before the tests are run so no asynchronous action is needed for setting up the declarables.
Let's simplify the common test setup by leaving out async-await, waitForAsync, and even the TestBed.compileComponents invocation as seen in this code snippet:
beforeEach(() => {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  });
});

The following points are true for common Angular testbed setup for tests covering all types of Angular declarables:
No need to use async-await
No need to use waitForAsync (formerly named async)
No need to call TestBed.compileComponents



Of course, there might be other reasons for introducing asynchronicity to our test setup but compiling and linking declarables is not one of them.
Enjoy a little less boilerplate in your Angular tests 🌞]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most powerful features when creating Angular components is the Async Pipe. The greatest thing about it is that it allows you to take advantage of asynchronous rendering in your template without having to worry about subscribing and unsubscribing from Observables.
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';
import { of, Subject } from 'rxjs';
import { delay, startWith, takeUntil } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <h1>Async example</h1> 
    <h2>Items</h2> 
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let item of items | async">{{item}}</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Other Items</h2> 
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let other of otherItems">{{other}}</li>
    </ul>
  `,
  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ]
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy  {

  items = of([1, 2, 3])
    .pipe(
      delay(2000), 
      startWith(['...'])
    );

  // vs 

  otherItems: any[];
  private destroy$ = new Subject();
  ngOnInit() {
    of([1, 2, 3])
      .pipe(
        delay(2000),
        startWith(['...']),
        takeUntil(this.destroy$)
      )
      .subscribe(other  => this.otherItems = other)
  }
  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.destroy$.next();
    this.destroy$.complete();
  }
}


Check it out on Stackblitz.
As you can see, in the first example, we are rendering a list (items) using the async pipe in the HTML template. There is no need for the additional handling after the component is destroyed, which you can see is not the case for the other list otherItems.   That is simply because the async pipe is going to take care of that for you.]]></summary>
