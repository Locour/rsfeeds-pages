        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lately, I've been looking for a better way to write clean conditional rendering code instead of ternary and && operators and even if statements, because sometimes they can be confusing and I found that I can write the same functionality with objects, it makes the code more readable. let's see how we can write a well-typed object to render a component based on the parent component state and props
export default function Products({state}:ProductsStateEnum)
:ReactElement {
const [_ProductsState, setProductsState] = useState(state)
  const ProductsState: { [key in ProductsStateEnum]: ReactElement } = {
    loading: <Loader width={150} />,
    failed: (
      <div>
          <Badge bg='danger'>Somethig Went Wrong</Badge>
      </div>
    ),
    done: (
      <>
        {products?.map(
          ({ id, title, image, description, category, price }) => (
            <ProductCard
              key={id}
              id={id}
              title={title}
              description={description}
              category={category}
              price={price}
              image={image}
            />
          )
        )}
      </>
    )
  }

  return <div className='row p-3'>{ProductsState[_ProductsState]}</div>
}

We notice here that we didn't write any if statement or any operator, based on the state the component will render the React component with key that's equal to the _ProductsState,  tell me if you know another way to write readable conditional rendering options!]]></summary>

Effects are a powerful model for handling side effects in your application. Commonly this means when you are making a HTTP request in a NgRx powered application you will use an effect to handle the communication with the service but they can do so much more than that. And frankly this is what I usually used them for until I read https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/start-using-ngrx-effects-for-this#handling-the-flow-of-a-angular-material-dialog . 
I became intrigued by the idea of offloading some component material dialog code into the effect and started viewing the life cycle as a series of events and using the effect to talk to other effects.

At the end, your app may scale and not all options can be deployed as multiple instance nodes without additional changes to the app and infrastructure.

let's get started 💃
What is a Website?


A website is a page or collection of pages on the World Wide Web (www) that contains specific information which was all provided by one person or entity and traces back to a common Uniform Resource Locator (URL). 
Examples of websites are:
• www.goggle.com
• www.cnn.com

Some of this work was undertaken by corporations. This is most clearly shown by Samsung Dex, a desktop skin of Android that is installed on most of Samsung's latest devices. It is still Android under the hood, and it isn't perfect either, but it provides a basic, Chromebook-Esque interface to Android. This software package is partly the reason why I chose the Samsung Galaxy S7 Tab as well.

So you need to patch the secret generated by Helm during the last update to change the status to deployed in the labels.
You can do it with an kubectl edit or directly with the following command.

"Dead code" is code that is never used. It is not referenced by any other code, it is not imported, it is not used in the final build in any way.
Refactoring a project to make certain types, methods, or properties obsolete without removing that obsolete code will create dead code. Changing the direction of a project, like choosing to use a different API or library can also produce dead code. On large projects with many different teams and shifting priorities, the occurrence of dead code is inevitable.
There are many reasons why you should delete dead code. There are many effects that dead code can have on a large project:

It depends on who you ask. To me, it is simply:
Audio and video editing
Document processing
Password managers
Web browsers
Video games
Conference software
Development software
Some might add 3d modeling tools, content streaming tools, or maybe torrenting utilities to this list. But for my day-to-day use on a computer, I interact with these software packages the most.
For this tutorial, I won't be covering Development software as I will get more involved in setting up and configuring these software packages on Android in a later tutorial. But I will briefly go over a few repositories that contain useful tools that I intend to use.
I also won't be going over the specific tools that I intend to use for everything but development. Everyone has their favorite document processor or PDF reader, no point in trying to convince you otherwise.
Have the Google Play Store installed on your device.
Search for any of the keywords listed above in the Google Play Store search bar.
Profit.
And that's it. That is the end of part 1 of this roadmap, which again was to install the "vanilla" software of Android. In the next tutorial, I will go over the development setup that I have done.
But if you want to jump the gun on what software I intend to use, checkout Termux on F-Droid.
Termux is the killer app that allows for desktop-class development to happen on Android OS.

  My laptop is dead for the most part.


The radio connections are dropping, the battery doesn't hold a charge as long as it used to, all the A/V inputs and outputs are broken, and the laptop doesn't display out. Furthermore, the device is approaching its sixth birthday. Sure, I could sit here and debug and fix most of these issues but I just don't have the time.
I also don't need the power of a laptop as often anymore. I'm not gaming on it, I don't run computationally intensive tasks on it as I have a proper desktop with some big-beefy specs to go along with it, and I never had any intention of holding onto it for this long.

In Javascript, arrays are without a doubt one of the most broadly used data structures. That's why we need as many built-in methods as possible to manipulate the arrays the way we want. Javascript evolves and almost every new ES specification brings us some new array methods making it easier and easier to work with arrays. One of my favorite new ones is Array.prototype.at which makes getting the last element of an array so simple!
Instead of
const lastElement = array[array.length - 1]

we can do:
const lastElement = array.at(-1)


The problem with array methods is well known to every developer. The thing is, some array methods mutate the original array but some don't. I challenge you to guess if Array.prototype.slice mutates or not? And what about Array.prototype.splice? I ca…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FreeCodeCamp in our last challenge showed us that React can control the internal state for certain elements like input and textarea, which makes them controlled components. This applies to other forms elements as well including the regular HTML form element.
Here MyForm component is set up with an empty form. As you can see it has the type set tosubmitindicating it is the button controlling the form. They want us to add theinputelement in theformand set itsvalueandonChange()` attributes like the last post.
`React
// Change code above this line

}
  render() {
      {/* Change code above this line */}
      <button type='submit'>Submit!</button>
    </form>
    {/* Change code below this line */}

    {/* Change code above this line */}
  </div>
);

}
}

We should also call `event.preventDefault() in the submit handler, to prevent default form submit behavior which will refresh the web page.
Lastly they want us to create an h1 tag after theformwhich renders thesubmitvalue from the component'sstate`. 


Answer:
`React




}

  render() {

    return (

      

        

          

          Submit!

        

        
{this.state.submit}

      

    );

  }

}

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our applications may have more complex interactions between state and the rendered UI. AS you know form control elements for text input such as input and textarea. maintain their own state in the DOM. But with React, we can move this mutable state into a React component's state. The user's input becomes part of the application state, so React controls the value of that input field.
FreeCodeCamp wants us to view the code editor with a component called ControlledInput to create a controlled input element. First they want us to create a method called handleChange() which has a parameter called event. Then when it's called it receives an event object that contains a string of text from input element. We can access this string with event.target.value inside the method.

We can create state in React component by declaring state property on the component class in its constructor.
Don't forget it must be set to a JavaScript object.
Ex:

Thanks to Volta, managing multiple versions of Node is no longer a pain.
Under the covers, all the Node version managers are doing the same thing: setting up symlinks to different versions of Node installed on your computer. The difference between them is how they manage those symlinks. If you know the correct version of Node for the project you are currently working on, you can use nvm to set it to the active version, and all is well, as long as you remember to do so. The problem here is that you need to know the correct version of Node. And if you're switching from a project that has different Node version requirements, you have to remember to switch each time you open one of those projects.

If you ask someone why sometimes JS is so confusing, probably one of the reasons is var😩 declaration. 
That was my experience too in 2017 when I had my first contact with JS. It was post-ES6(ES2015), which means the let and const were there. 
"lucky me, var is history and now we live in a new era" 🙌. Guess what happened? Yeah, I was hit by a var bug in the face. TKO 👊😵, not stand a chance.
It's true that with ES2015 we have great alternatives for declarations in let🔥 and const🔥, but it is also important to know how var works (and pray we do not go into it 🙏   ).

Lets talk about Images they are pretty cool right? Imagers are everywhere including in Articles and Emails.
![alt text](https://yoursite.com/some_image)

Or in HTML you'd use the image tag
<img src="https://yoursite.com/some_image" alt="alt text" />

and of course the markdown above is later compiled to HTML So lets focus on that.
So when a webpage have an image the browser will send an http request to the URL which is in the src of the image(https://yoursite.com/some_image in our case).
https://yoursite.com will send us and image which will be later shown to us in browser.
https://yoursite.com/ could look something like this
app.get("/some_image", (req, res) => {

app.get("/some_image", (req, res) => {
     notifyUser() //You can implement it the way you want

Now we will be notified whenever a user sees our image. That also means that if we use this image in our article/email we will know when a user opens it/reads it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Would you like to get notified when someone opens your dev.to article or reads your email? Yea that will be awesome. Okay then lets see how we can do that?
Lets talk about Images they are pretty cool right? Imagers are everywhere including in Articles and Emails.
![alt text](https://yoursite.com/some_image)

Or in HTML you'd use the image tag
<img src="https://yoursite.com/some_image" alt="alt text" />

and of course the markdown above is later compiled to HTML So lets focus on that.
So when a webpage have an image the browser will send an http request to the URL which is in the src of the image(https://yoursite.com/some_image in our case).
https://yoursite.com will send us and image which will be later shown to us in browser.
https://yoursite.com/ could look something like this
app.get("/some_image", (req, res) => {
     res.sendFile('some_image.jpg')
})

But the question is, is it that all we can do? Well its our code we can do whatever we want. So why not just notify our self that someone viewed this image?

The idea behind Golpo is to share links in a uncluttered and ad free platform. It allows user to showcase their creations or just share feelings and likings. 
Currently user can Share links/urls, bookmark them, share comments, love them, follow creators or anyone, chat with them. More features coming soon...
But we need some people to join us, as an open source community to make Golpo a great place to showcase our own works and also share our feelings through links!
Frontend is built on Svelte - https://github.com/Ananto30/golpo-svelte
Backend on Express - https://github.com/Ananto30/golpo-express
We have some tasks on both. But frontend has some priorities. And I will add more daily.

I'm writing this so you don't make the same mistake as our team.
This started out great.
In retrospect, we now know that we had created a false sense of security.
To give a simple example, a lot of our code to create a new instance of a type looked like this.
// inline
const customer = { customerId: newid(), name: 'Sarah' } as Customer;
// or a variant with angle brackets
const customer = <Customer>{ customerId: newid(), name: 'Sarah' };

// even better, via a factory method
function createCustomer(name: string) {
    return { customerId: newid(), names } as Customer;
}

The code has two problems concerning the correctness of these objects when the respective type is changed:
new properties that are required aren't caught;
existing properties that are removed aren't flagged;
The simple fix is to ditch the type assertions and to replace them with type annotations and return types.
// inline
const customer: Customer = { customerId: newid(), name: 'Sarah' };

// even better, via a factory method
function createCustomer(name: string): Customer {
    return { customerId: newid(), names };
}

With the updated snippet, we now get correct and helpful compile errors when the type is modified.
To enforce this practice, you can enable the ESLint rule Enforces consistent usage of type assertions (consistent-type-assertions).
Fiddle with this example in the following TypeScript playground.

Basically, it's an app that takes your website's RSS feed and displays it in a nice app UI.
For my fellow dev's out there, I have used Firebase, Django, expo and few more technology. You can check out the code in the github repo.
Ever wanted to reach out to your readers and notify about some updates. if yes, then this app has got you covered, it has Push Notification support.
Want to know how many users log-in and out of your app. we have got you covered, Custom Analytics(basic).
Note: You can add your own Analytics service provider, if 
App has Guest login, save for later, and much more.
Currently there is no ad's in the app, So there is no revenue generated from this app.
if you are an expo dev then you can add your own ad service.(if you want to)
Yep, its an open-source project.
At first everything that i have used is free but if u want to scale it up or your readers go crazy with the app. then you might have to pay (not to me but to Heroku or Firebase).
You can learn more about the app and its features here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So today let’s discuss another method of data encryption and decryption using PHP AES-256-CBC and OpenSSL to cipher[encryption] and decipher[decryption] any string in the PHP.
Encryption is a common method to protect data in the cyber world, which converts plain text into a long ciphertext constructed with random alphanumeric characters.
We are using AES Advanced Encryption Standard with 256 bits key length. The following image shows how symmetric key encryption works:

class secureToke
{
    private static $secretKey = 'Your Desired key(Alphanumeric)';
    private static $secretIv = 'www.domain.com';
    private static $encryptMethod = "AES-256-CBC";
    public static function tokenencrypt($data)
    {
        $key = hash('sha256', self::$secretKey);
        $iv = substr(hash('sha256', self::$secretIv), 0, 16);
        $result = openssl_encrypt($data, self::$encryptMethod, $key, 0, $iv);
        return $result = base64_encode($result);
    }
    public static function tokendecrypt($data)
    {
        $key = hash('sha256', self::$secretKey);
        $iv = substr(hash('sha256', self::$secretIv), 0, 16);
        $result = openssl_decrypt(base64_decode($data), self::$encryptMethod, $key, 0, $iv);
        return $result;
    }
}

Encryption method:
$tokenencrypt = secureToken::tokenencrypt($token);

Decryption method:
$tokendecrypt = secureToken::tokendecrypt($encryptedtoken);

Voila! it’s done… Now you can encrypt your entire data on the webspace and make them secure. 🙂]]></summary>

Public key cryptography is one of the fundamental technologies that enables the XRP Ledger and other blockchain systems to operate.
It uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. Anyone can create a new account and have authority to sign transactions from that account. In order to generate these keys, you can use a software library like ripple-keypairs.
Many of the applications that integrate with the XRP Ledger depend on the stability and security of ripple-keypairs in order to create and use XRP Ledger accounts.
Each account has an address, which is derived from the account's master public key. It might also have a regular key, which is a secondary way to authorize transactions from an account.

"Let’s use a token to secure this API call. Should I use the ID token or the access token? ​🤔 The ID token looks nicer to me. After all, if I know who the user is, I can make better authorization decisions, right?"
Have you ever found yourself making similar arguments? Choices based on your intuition may sound good, but what looks intuitive is not always correct. In the case of ID and access tokens, they have clear and well-defined purposes, so you should use them based on that. Using the wrong token can result in your solution being insecure.
"What changes after all? They are just tokens. I can use them as I see fit. What’s the worst that could happen?"
Let’s take a closer look at these two types of tokens to better understand their role in authentication and authorization processes.
An ID token is an artifact that proves that the user has been authenticated. It was introduced by OpenID Connect (OIDC), an open standard for authentication used by many identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and, of course, Auth0. Check out this document for more details on OpenID Connect. Let's take a quick look at the problem OIDC wants to resolve.
Consider the following diagram:

Here, a user with their browser authenticates against an OpenID provider and gets access to a web application. The result of that authentication process based on OpenID Connect is the ID token, which is passed to the application as proof that the user has been authenticated.
This provides a very basic idea of what an ID token is: proof of the user's authentication. Let’s see some other details.
An ID token is encoded as a JSON Web Token (JWT), a standard format that allows your application to easily inspect its content, and make sure it comes from the expected issuer and that no one else changed it. If you want to learn more about JWTs, check out The JWT Handbook.

Authentication Flows
I'll go thorough how we can do this using Postman.
Client Credentials
Implicit grant
Authorization code grant

Resource owner credentials grant

Backend AAD App
 For the first step all we need to do is fill in the name of the app and click register. In other flows you might also need to fill in the redirect Uri as well, this is so that the token response can go back to the client.

It is recommended to use an IdP server as a provider for user authentication to the Kubernetes API (for example, using OIDC) Cluster administrators are advised not to use service account tokens for authentication.
It is recommended to use a centralized certificate management service to manage certificates within the cluster (for user and service purposes)
User accounts should be personalized. The names of the service accounts should reflect the purpose access rights of the accounts.
Authorization
For each cluster, a role-based access model should be developed.

So you know about bash and zsh and how they work right? The fish shell is not like those shells. I mean they kinda have similarities but they do differ very much. ZSH can execute bash commands in a native as bash does but fish shell requires some editing to it specially when it comes to setting variables and exporting paths.

I usually work on the terminals only and for that I frequent switch between different directories, editing them in vim (I use neovim), etc. So for me having a built-in autocompletion for shell with syntax highlighting and is a plus point.

  A Yummy Analogy


Imagine you have ordered your favorite pizza of large size. You see, the pizza is divided into 8 slices. Assuming you are kind enough to share the pizza with 3 of your friends, each of you gets 2 slices each. Now let’s observe the following:
Cost savings: You can buy one whole pizza, and share it among 4 people
Isolation: What you do with your slice of pizza has no effect whatsoever on your friend’s slice.
Efficient pizza sharing: If one of your friends wants to eat 3 slices, and another one just wants one, it can be done.
Compare it with buying a large pizza that you are not able to eat all by yourself and 5 pieces of it going to waste, or a plate of dessert that you have to share with…]]></summary>

A question comes in mind that how it works internally. It works like there is a big list say 10k items are there. Displaying all those items in once is not possible as it will break the application. And you can not put numbering pagination as that will look bad on the place or you have dropdown (dropdowns can not number paginations).

  Generic CRUD Service


Before we start generating and writing code, let’s take a step back and see the bigger picture. The generic service should accept the following arguments:
the HttpClient is used for the HTTP requests
the class of model for creating instances
the path of the API endpoints.
Also, all resources should have 5 main methods related to CRUD…
Create - Returns a new resource.
