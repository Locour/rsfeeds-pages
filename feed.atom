        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tomty is a Raku test framework with focus on devops tasks. Tomty allows one to write test scenarios on Bash (and only) and orchestrate them using Raku.
In this post I am going to give a quick introduction into Tomty.
Tomty is installed as Raku module, using zef - Raku package manager:
zef install --/test https://github.com/melezhik/Sparrow6.git
zef install --/test https://github.com/melezhik/Tomty.git 

We need bleeding edge version of Tomty and Sparrow (dependency for Tomty) to get an access to all the features mentioned in this post.
Working with Tomty requires some initialization. First of all we need to create a working directory for tests and initialize it. Optionally we can install Bash completion for tomty - Tomty cli application:

I like Pikaday. This is because it is framework independent and great browser compatibility (includes IE7!).
Pikaday - GitHub
But it can only select the date. And this time i want to choose the month.
For Chrome and Edge or some other browsers, I can use "input type="month"".

input type="month" - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN
But because it can't be used in all modern browsers, and I don't like its selecting years design, I don't want to use it.
Because I only could find month pickers for jQuery, React, and etc, I will try creating it.
In this sample, I don't care about old browsers.
Node.js ver.16.3.0
TypeScript ver.4.3.4
Moment ver.2.29.1
ts-loader ver.9.2.3

It is not a big deal when we have to make just one or two API calls per requests. But most of the time we have to make two or more API calls depending on the requests. That's when problem occurs. Because the more API calls you make, the longer it will need to serve the data.
Let's assume you have to handle a request which requires five API calls. You make five API calls one by one. When all of the data is available, you clean, format and merge them and send it to the frontend. Let's say it takes six seconds to get data from all of the API calls. Six seconds may seem feasible but it's always better to make things efficient and faster whenever possible.

Today, the matter concerning my existence is how one goes about making their Docker images more secure — and the fallout from trying to do that.
The third part of the DevOps Detour was all concerned with upgrading cert-manager and ingress-nginx, and how I thought the cert-manager upgrade would take forever when it ended up being the easy one of the two.

I didn't find much info on the web (maybe my search queries were poor) and what I found was  mostly about using Laravel Passport or Sanctum, but that's used with authentication and not necessary for my app. The session id gets stored in a cookie, but I didn't know in the beginning that Laravel actually handles setting the cookie for you when things are set up properly.

Many content management sites (CMS) have the titles of a post added to part of the URL for simple bookmarking purposes. For example, if you write a Medium post titled Stop Using Reduce, it's likely the URL would have some form of the title string in it (.../stop-using-reduce).
Let's Fill in the urlSlug function so it converts a string title and returns the hyphenated version for the URL.
The input is a string with spaces and title-cased words
The output is a string with the spaces between words replaced by a hyphen (-)
The output should be all lower-cased letters
The output should not have any spaces




// Only change code below this line
function urlSlug(title) {


}
// Only change code above this line

Answer:




function urlSlug(title) {
return title
    .toLowerCase()
    .split(" ")
    .filter(str => str != "") // <-- basically saying if the str being passed is not equal to an empty string return that str
    .join("-")

}

console.log(urlSlug(" Winter Is Coming"))

urlSlug(" Winter Is  Coming") returns the string winter-is-coming]]></summary>

express to nodejs app.



index.js in root source.



./api folder or you can rename anything which you like.



Here is an example for manage product from ./api/product.


After testing is 👌. Commit them to git to see something awesome.


Because Vercel just supports API from Framework JS as NEXT.JS, Nuxt.JS,... So if we develop a standalone application we need to configure or tell the server of Vercel how is it work by vercel.json file.
vercel.json file to root source.



Commit it to GitHub and make sure version is 2 - this is required from Vercel.

You see, I use a code editor called Vim, which is sort of like an operating system for writing code.  I know it might seem bizarre, but there's a method to my madness:  Vim lets me write code very quickly and with very little effort. It's a great way of working that I wake up excited to do every day.  

Vim is one of the most popular text editors, which is why you’re either using it or wondering why you should be using it. But if you’re not a programmer, why should you care?
It's a matter of preference, but 
You don’t have to open vim to write code
If you’re like us, you don’t want to have to switch between your text editor and your terminal while you write your code.
You can use it over an SSH connection
This is a big plus. With a few commands you're inanother computer and can edit right away
It works on all operating systems
Even the most obsecure operating systems support vim. Like some router with busybox installed
It's completely controlled by key presses
You don't need to use the mouse, vim is controlled by key presses. However if you like clicking around, there's gvim.
Vim does have a steep learning curve, but you can practice vim on sites like vim.is]]></summary>

Between Zero Trust and the emergence of microservices, handling secrets such as tokens, credentials, and keys has become an increasingly challenging task. That’s where a solution like HashiCorp’s Vault can help organizations solve their secret management woes.
Although there are secret management tools native to each cloud provider, using these solutions lock you in with a specific cloud provider. Vault, on the other hand, is open source and portable.
In this article we’ll look at how HashiCorp’s Vault can help organizations manage their secrets and in turn enhance their cybersecurity posture. We’ll then set up Vault in dev mode on our machines and interact with it via its web UI and CLI. …]]></summary>

With generic and reusable code, your project will start faster. All that's left is to write the business rules part of your project.
I work with React to build front end. As languages, I use Javascript or Typescript. I prefer Typescript, but at work, sometime you have no choices.
As CSS framework, my preference goes to Bulma.
It's simple, easy to tweak or override and especially, it contains no Javascript or Jquery, only HTML and CSS rules.
All I expect from a CSS framework.
I dislike make the same thing again and again. It's useless and repetitive tasks create bugs.
Some of basic components stays the same on all projects
That's why I create a NPM package called react-components.
It's a library of basic components made with Bulma and React Typescript.
The objectives :
Learn how to create and publish a package.
Learn more about open source not by participating but by being at the origin of a (very small) project.
Learn how to manage advice and criticism about my project to progress as a developer.
Have basics components available immediately.
Nowadays, This project is under development and contains lots of beginner mistakes.
I work on it as a side project, between all my side projects, so it's progressing very slowly.
I think to make more posts about this work and all the challenges I meet.
If you want know more about this project or how to contribute, don't be shy. Comments and DM on Twitter are open.]]></summary>

This is one of the most used operators when I have to deal with large numbers. When using a separator (with just an _) in number it looks better than an unseparated number.
For example:
let number = 98234567

to ⬇
let number = 98_234_567

And it works for any other numeric base as well:
const binary = 0b1000_0101;
const hex = 0x12_34_56_78;

The use of semi-colons for line termination is a good practice. You won’t be warned if you forget it, because in most cases it will be inserted by the JavaScript parser but relying on Automatic Semicolon Insertion(ASI) is not encouraged.
This is even included in Google’s, Airbnb’s, and jQuery’s Javascript style guides.

The official doc, tells me to do as follow:
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
$ ng new my-project

I'm a bit bothered by this, because:
I'm not going to use that much before switching to the newer npm version
I don't want to thing about any possible ways global version of angular cli would collide with local versions installed in projects
Besides, I really like the light-weight approach frameworks like Next.js or NuxtJS are allowing you to just start playing with their code generator.
Luckily, there is this alternative way of generating angular project:
$ npx -p @angular/cli ng my-project

as you can see it here:
it does the job:

Even though angular documentation seems to assume you have no reason of trying out their framework, unless you it's your job and you need all the tooling all the time (maybe they are right about it); here we have an easier way of running their generator command, without turning our environment into angular-shop.]]></summary>

You have to navigate to websites like Flaticon, Font Awesome, Material Icons etc., find suitable icons, download the SVG or copy the font  and finally need to include the corresponding libraries to your code base. Reducing this hassle and the bundle size associated with importing external packages was the main inspiration behind this VS Code extension.
With Get-Svg-Icons extension, you no longer have to navigate to other websites to choose your icon, everything comes handy on VS code itself. A side panel with customizable icons and the inline icon suggestions on vscode editor makes the process easy and thus increase productivity of developers.  
Side Panel with around 1300+ icons
Users can search for the icon-name (or tags associated with it) and choose the desired icon
On clicking on the icon, corresponding svg code will be inserted at the last active position on the code editor
Users can change the height and width of the svg directly from the side panel

Type "icon-" (without quotes) to start auto-completing icons. If the icon preview is not showing up (as shown in the GIF below), press Ctrl+Space (default hotkey) or press the  ">" icon to expand the details view.
An inline replacement of the selected icon with its svg will be done.

On hovering over the svg code (class name) , you can preview the icon of the corresponding svg snippet

It's not so evident that the Accept header is an essential part of HTTP and especially REST communication.
Accept header, either I'm.
This short article will show how simple to add validation and matching to your HTTP router independently to the router and framework you use.
Accept header is a simple list of mime types (application/json, text/html, etc.) or wildcard rules (*/*, application/*, etc.) that a client supports.

So, whenever, we want to use custom code in lambda functions supporting nodejs environment. We write that code in form of  node modules  and to make that code shared through lambda layers, we have to make a build  of those node modules. That build will be uploaded to a  Lambda Layer  and layer can be attached to any lambda function which can ultimately access that code.

        <updated>2021-07-03T14:56:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article talks about an efficient way to implement auto-complete feature using Angular concepts. The key components used in this demonstration are as follows:
Angular Material (v12) Autocomplete module.
RxJS for action and data binding.
Angular in-memory-web-api for REST services (Refer to in-memory-web-api).
 

 

 




Let us now see how we go about it:
The front-end consists of an angular autocomplete module. The input event taps the user's keystrokes and emits a new value into an action subject.

AutocompleteService class.

The action BehaviorSubject starts with an empty string. The action$ is an observable built out of this subject.

GET request. Since this is a higher-order observable (i.e., an observable returning an observable), we make use of one of the higher order functions like switchMap.

switchMap (and not other higher order functions like concatMap or mergeMap)? The reason is: switchMap unsubscribes from the previous observable once a new value is emitted by the parent observable.
What this means is - as soon as the user types in another letter or removes a letter, there is simply no need to subscribe and execute the rest call for the previous values. The user is only interested to see the results of the search according to his/her current input. And switchMap does this automatically, and thus gets rid of unwanted rest calls.
We can also get additional control on when to fire the rest service depending on the length of the user's input. For example, in this demo, I fire the rest call only when the user has entered at least 2 characters. If not, then I return an observable of empty array (using of([])).
 


  
  
  Back to the Component:


We tap onto the above observable and use async pipe to subscribe to it. Since we are completely using observables, we can also use the OnPush change-detection-strategy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Simple is not easy, easy is not simple
Let's first get that out of the way. People are often equating easiness with simplicity, but they are very different words.
Simple (vs complex) - from "sim plex", literally: one-fold (i.e. not braided)


Easy (vs hard) - from "lying at, lie near"; familiar, near to our understanding



Rich Hickey goes more into details about this in his presentation. If you haven't already, check it out (I don't agree with everything he said, but it's a good presentation, definitely worth watching).
Most often, achieving simplicity is the hardest thing to do in software development and usually it requires an enormous experience.
Simplicity is probably the most important aspect of software development. As Edsger Dijkstra put it, "Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability".
If your design is not simple, the whole thing will eventually become fragile, unreliable and starting to fall apart.
Unfortunately, complexity sells much better and when you combine that with cargo-cult programming and resume driven development, you get the modern web development mess.
The same goes for modern system administration (or devops, if you will) - if you've been working with UNIX long enough, all you need to do is take a look at Kubernetes mess.
I created devsimplicity.com as a simple, wiki-like place, focused mostly on addressing those issues, avoiding complexity traps and as a quick way to find&explore the better/saner alternatives. There's still lot of work to do, but it's getting better. If you like the idea, follow me on twitter.com/devsimplicity or here for the updates.

Let's find out what the framework itself is. A framework is a program that combines one or more functions, simplifying the work of a programmer. The framework works in the same programming language in which it was written. (The framework we create for Node.js is written in JavaScript)
Node.js is a runtime program that allows you to use the javascript programming language outside the browser. It contains several modules, such as http and so on. Popular apps created at Node.js: Linkedin, Netflix, Ebay and Uber. The most popular frameworks of this program are Express.js, Telegraf.js and so on.

If you have worked as a developer or administrator in the industry, chances are you've worked with modern container runtimes such as Docker and Kubernetes or at least heard of them. From a high-level perspective, containers are an OS-level abstraction - a stripped down operating system (OS) containing one or more applications (apps) of interest running atop some host in an isolated manner, which provides an extra layer of security compared to running the app(s) directly on the host and enables the app(s) to be executed on different hosts (possibly with different hardware) in a consistent, rep…]]></summary>

Azure Functions is a cloud service available on-demand that provides all the continually updated infrastructure and resources needed to run your applications. You focus on the pieces of code that matter most to you, and Functions handles the rest. Functions provides serverless compute for Azure. You can use Functions to build web APIs, respond to database changes, process IoT streams, manage message queues, and more.

Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that allows us to protect cryptographic keys, certificates (and the private keys associated with certificates), and secrets (such as connection strings and passwords) in the cloud.

Recently, I started a small Angular application that acts as an installer for a distributed API Gateway application.

It was mostly security dynamic analysis over our client and server communication. Fortify is a product that we have used for this since the company that I work for owns it, and recently they added support for Typescript in their static code analysis. So this was a great opportunity to use it on our Angular project.

SRI é uma especificação da W3C que permite aos desenvolvedores web garantir que os recursos hospedados em servidores de terceiros não foram adulterados. Seu uso é recomendado como boa prática, sempre que as bibliotecas são carregadas de uma fonte de terceiro.
O HTTPS garante que a conexão entre o navegador e o servidor seja segura.

It is imperative to choose the correct form of technology that helps you achieve what you want and helps in achieving your aim. A wrong decision can eat your time and leave your project in shambles. 
Why Choose Angular For Web Development? Let us look into some of the reasons for choosing Angular for your next project and how it will impact your business.
Parented by Google
Fulfills the Requirements
Purposefully informative
Checks and balances
The first impression is the last
using Angular CLI. All the components have predefined styles which help in the fast delivery of the service. Angular Material documentation is replete with the necessary examples which are required.
Package in itself
SPAs
Module Based
Friendly user-experience
Concluding to the final question- is it still relevant given that it has been here for a decade Yes! Absolutely! It is up-to-date and quite efficient in helping you build modern products. It is supported, powered, and parented by Google, and that in itself makes Angular's future bright. However, depending upon your project, the choice of the framework should be taken judiciously. The angular ecosystem is vast and continues to bring a lot to the table. The core team releases biannual versions, making it always excitable for the next updated version.]]></summary>

Here, how anyone can do it.
Open Command prompt or Powershell 
pip install --upgrade pip
pip3 install virtualenvwrapper-win

Remember :- Python.3x - uses pip3 and Python.2x - uses pip
Creating, working and deleting specific python virtual environment
mkvirtual env1
deactivate

workon env1
pip3 install flask
decativate

rmvirtualenv env1

This is like, we can create multiple python virtual environment in C Drive at specific location and can be accessable it from anywhere, if we working on any project or doing something.
Screenshot - cmd

venv for certain task


Let's do it.
Open bash ( Terminal )

if not installed, we can install now
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip3
pip3 install --upgrade pip3

Then installing virtual environment
sudo pip3 install virtualenvwrapper
sudo pip3 install virtualenvwrapper-win

Creating any folder in home directory, like
mkdir pyenvs

Making changes to the .bashrc file
sudo nano ~/.bashrc

You will see like this screen

Scroll down (or use Down key ) till the end, then Copy and Paste these below script but find the "Your_user_name" by command uname -r and  version of python as python3.7, python3.8 and python3.9 etc using which python3.
For example: In my case,
'/home/ajay/pyens'
'/usr/bin/python3.9'





export WORKON_HOME='/home/Your_user_name/pyens'
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON='/usr/bin/python3.x'
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

Ctrl+S (save) and Ctrl+X (moving out from the file)
And creating python virtual environment either single or multiple times is same as like in windows.
bash ( Terminal )


Screenshot - bash

Check out pypi virtualenvwrapper-win on python pypi packages

Modern employees require more flexibility than their previous counterparts. 
54% of employees say they’d rather shift to a career that offers them more flexibility. In other words, organizations are more likely to retain employees if they offer flexible work arrangements.
But shifting from in-person work to remote work comes with a full host of changes (and something to keep in mind when starting a business). The most crucial one? Making sure your remote team is set up to work safely and securely. 
But before we touch on 10 tips to improve your remote team’s security, let’s take a look at the importance of safe and secure remote working.

Although you can use monolithic applications for a few use cases, modern features usually don’t work in an application based on monolithic architecture. Monolithic applications can become large and unmanageable that require coordination and effort from multiple teams, even if a small change is needed.

--
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine

Once this is done, let's quickly check if SSR is working as per our expectation.
npm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr

Node server fires up on port 4000 and I check for my webpage's source.
view-source:http://localhost:4000/


ng add @angular/pwa

No extra configurations so far, and that's how it will be. Let's build our universal application once again and serve it on localhost:4000.
But wait!!! Now when I view my webpage source on the browser, I get this:

So does this mean that my SSR is broken?
Nope! My SSR is perfectly fine :-) Let's run a quick check to prove this. Open up POSTMAN and run a GET request against http://localhost:4000. And voila! I see my server-side-rendered page once again!

--
index.html is now cached by service-worker at the browser. The browser does not need to wait for the server to render the content any more, and it simply serves the cached version, and Angular takes over thereafter, like a normal SPA. Open up ngsw-config.json and verify that index.html is one of the cached resources.

Note (and a small exercise): If you remove index.html from ngsw-config.json and re-build your universal, you would see that the server-rendered content is back on your browser source, since the HTML is now no longer being cached!

With it, you can build efficient native, web, and mobile apps with a wide range of tools and libraries it integrates. However, there are still ways apps built with it can be improved. For example, using Angular Universal, you can render your apps server-side to speed up page loads and improve SEO and performance.
Server-side rendering involves converting an app to HTML on a server. When you send a request for a particular path to the server, it returns an entirely static HTML page as a response. No additional requests need to be made to populate the page with data and resources as it is all contained in the response. The page appears almost…]]></summary>

Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃

Caveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.
