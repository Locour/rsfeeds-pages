        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a library to generate development infrastructure for typescript project.
chore-cli is the super assistant for building a typescript library. It can generate development infrastructure for projects or libraries, such as prettier, eslint, husky etc, or even Github Actions Config files. It can save a lot of time every time you create new stuff.
As we know, These tools like eslint, prettier can make the codebase better. But it takes us a lot of time to configure them. If you don't want your enthusiasm for writing code to be consumed by these configurations, and if you don't like doing these annoying "chores" frequently, try chore-cli.
It's easy to useÔºö
npx chore-cli <path-to-project>


Take a look at the README.md for examples and further documentation, and let me know if you find any bugs, or you have any idea for improving it.]]></summary>

  Key Concepts


I don't intend to leave behind the many developers that are just getting started. So, here's the general breakdown that you HAVE TO know.
Container is just as it sounds, a box to separate out resources used by it. This is somewhere between running apps directly in your host vs running in a VM (Virtual Machine). In a VM only the hardware resources are shared. However, in docker the OS kernel is shared. This does mean that the security of your container can be compromised if you let it (That's a whole another beast of its own, so I'll leave that out.

Referrers on the web allow sites you are visiting to see what site you have come from, as the Referer header (it is actually mispelled in the HTTP Specification) contains a absolute or partial url of the site you've come from if you have followed a link.
commonly used for tracking and analytics, but it can also be used to steal information for example that contained in the URL of a reset password page or where a token is part of the URL, which is why it comes under security headers.

One way is to enter the terminal outside of the GUI. X11 or Wayland provides the graphical user interface on linux. You can switch to the terminal by pressing Alt+Ctrl+F1 to F12.

Example code is in Typescript, but you can leave out type annotations such as a:number and public, private to convert to Javascript.
A custom element is a HTML tag that has executable code added to it. That's really handy for game objects! We'll use that to add physics later. You can nest custom ‚Ä¶]]></summary>

What is the logical next step? I think you'll find the answer to this question within the question itself. 

Next is a framework built on top of React that purports to make the development process even more palatable. Personally, I enjoy working with React already, so I was surprised to find the extent to which Next delivers on its promise. 
What exactly makes learning Next a worthwhile endeavour? There's a lot that sets Next apart from simply using React, but let's start with 3 key features that Next implements to solve common React problems.

Before proceeding, I am assuming, you are aware of the request-response architecture of a basic web application. To build a real-time application like a chat application we can't use the basic request-response architecture, but we can use it with a polling mechanism to achieve the real-time behaviour. Apart from the polling mechanism we also have SSE(server-side event) and WebSocket to achieve real-time behaviour.
In this article, I am going to discuss two types of polling techniques i.e, long polling and short polling.
First, we need to know, what is polling?
Polling is a technique in which the client sends a request to the server asking for data in an interval of time.
The response from the server can be empty or any kind of data.

Note : If you are going to use RHEL8 then you have to run below script because RHEL8 doesn't contain docker software by default But for other one you can skip it.

Will Deno JS be able to replace NodeJS?
Given that Deno can be considered to be an improved alternative to node JS, it might replace node JS in the long run. Nevertheless, it will only be possible over a significant period mainly because a large community depends on node js. At least for the time being, Node js isn‚Äôt going anywhere; Deno is only considered a fancy alternate choice.

To ease deployment and not "fiddle around" with servers and infrastructure, I chose to run my game server under Heroku.

This is the third and final article in a series that guides you through the process of creating a ‚Äúwishlist‚Äù mobile application using the Flutter SDK. The wishlist contains items that the user would like to someday own, storing each item‚Äôs name, description, and URL. The mobile app provides the user interface and communicates with a back-end application, which stores the list and provides an API to perform CRUD operations on it. The initial version of the app simply provides a functioning wishlist, while the final version incorporates Auth0 authentication to allow only authorized users to use the app as well as to use a secure API.

Let me be clear, I love JavaScript and the freedom it provides, for a long time I was "against" TypeScript.
So I want to go on a journey together, figuring out if TypeScript is worth using or TS is only for people who don't know how to code properly (this was an inside joke in my team a time ago!).

Vulnerabilities in billions of Wi-Fi devices let hackers bypass firewalls


It's dubbed FragAttacks and it's bad news.
Excerpt from the article:
FragAttacks allow data to be injected into Wi-Fi traffic, but they don‚Äôt make it possible to exfiltrate anything out. That means FragAttacks can‚Äôt be used to read passwords or other sensitive information the way a previous Wi-Fi attack of Vanhoef, called Krack, did.
But it turns out that the vulnerabilities‚Äîsome that have been part of Wi-Fi since its release in 1997‚Äîcan be exploited to inflict other kinds of damage, particularly if paired with other types of hacks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learn how to use the Linux command line to save time and run commands faster. If you use a Unix-based operating system, such as Linux or macOS, you‚Äôre probably familiar with the shell, also called the command line. 
The shell lets you interact with your system by entering commands that perform actions. When it comes to mastering the shell, there are a lot of possibilities for streamlining your work.

Linux shells are a thing of beauty. They are the command line interfaces that power servers, minicomputers, supercomputers, embedded systems - and they are one of the most powerful tools in a system administrator's arsenal.
A lot of tech professionals use the command line to do their job.
Learning to use the Bash command line on a Linux-based operating system will change your life. It will save you hours of frustration and anger, level up your career, and improve your life in many other ways. If you want to practice the command line, I recommend this site
Servers
If you use a server or web server for your project, it most likely runs on Linux. You can connect to the server using ssh and control it using commands.
ssh user@ip

Then login and you can control it with commands.
Search files
The power of the command line lies in its ability to perform tasks faster than you could with an interface alone. For example, if you want to find out where a file is located on your hard drive, you can use Nautilus/Dolphin (or Finder on a Mac) to locate it or just type one command:
find /home -type f -name filename.txt

You can also use the fd command
> fd netfl
Software/python/imdb-ratings/netflix-details.py

Navigate file system
You can navigate the file system with the cd and ls commands. ls shows you the files in the current directory. cd changes the directory.
Some commands include cd ~ go to home directory, cd dir enter directory, cd .. leave directory.
That's all you need to navigate your file system. Here you can find a large list of commands for Linux.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's take a closer look at what documents are and how they're used to store data in a structured way.
A document is a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs.
Just like the below object, where the field is a unique identifier for some data point, and the value is data related to a given identifier.
{
 <field> : <value>,
 <field> : <value>,
 "name"  : "Raju",
 "title" : "Team Leader",
 "age"   : "26"
}

In this example, there is a field name, and the value is Raju.
We will look closer at documents and their structures once we get our hands on an actual data set.
But for now, this is a simple example of a document.
A collection would contain many documents similar to this one.
And a database would contain multiple collections.
In this post, I defined what document and collection mean in MongoDB.
In the next post, I will start querying collections for documents and interact with the database in general.]]></summary>

NoSQL is a very generic term used to describe any data store that doesn't use legacy approach of related tables of data.
This means that you're storing your data in an organized way, but not in rows and columns An example of NoSQL databases can be anything from a library card catalog, to a more sophisticated data store like MongoDB.
Since the range of what NoSQL means is so wide, we must narrow our definition further.
MongoDB is a NoSQL document database.
This means that data in MongoDB is stored as documents. I will cover what a document is in the next post.
These documents are in turn stored in what MongoDB call collections of documents.
That's why MongoDB is categorized as a NoSQL document database.
In conclusion, the MongoDB database is a NoSQL document database.]]></summary>

A cool trick in TypeScript is that you can use a Set to remove nonunique values from an array. Combine this with Array.from and you get a quick one liner to remove none unique values
const unqiueValues = Array.from(new Set(YOUR_ARRAY_HERE))

// Our array of non unique values
const values = [0,0,1,'a','a','b','c'];

// Create a `Set` from our array
// Sets can only contain unique values so duplicate will be removed for us
const uniqueSet = new Set(values);

// Create a new array from our set so we can use the Array.length property
const unqiueValues = Array.from(uniqueSet);

// Compare the length of the original `values` array and the new `uniqueValues` array
// If the lengths differ then a non unique value was removed by the set
// This means that the original array contained non-unique values
const isUnique = (values.length === unqiueValues.length)

const values = [0,0,1,'a','a','b','c'];
const unique = (Array.from(new Set(values)).length === values.length);

onlyUnique(values: Array<any>): boolean {
  return (Array.from(new Set(values)).length === values.length);
}

 Summary




  
  
  Intro 


Continuing on from my previous blog about website security week, we're going to talk about a series of X- security headers.
These are set as headers on your site when it is served up, let's dive in!



This header indicates that the browser should not try and sniff the type of the file served up. Sniffing of the file type would mean the browser modifying the Content-Type header that is returned from the server.
Sniffing the file content type could lead to non executable files being made executable, this could lead to bad actors injecting executable code into normal files and could lead to vulnerabilities.
It's best not to let the browser sniff the code.
Recommended setting:
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

You can read about it more on Modzilla.



This header has mostly been superseeded by the Content Security Policy, however its still useful for old browsers.
Recommended setting:
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block

You can read about it more on Modzilla.



This header has mostly been superseeded by the Content Security Policy, however its still useful for old browsers.
This indicates if the site can be loaded in a <frame>, <iframe>, <embed> or <object>.
Recommended setting:
X-Frame-Options: DENY

You can read about it more on Modzilla.



In summary, setting a few additional headers when serving up your site can really improve the security of your site. It reduces the amount of attack surface there is for attackers and prevent common attacks on websites.
Set those headers now!
Happy Building!]]></summary>

Vim is often used by Linux but it works on every system. It's included by default on Mac OS X.
If you type / then a search term, Vim will start searching forwards from the current cursor location for that word. 
To search for the next occurrence of that search term, press n (for next); to search backwards press N . After pressing n or N , Vim will highlight all matching words, which you can then press on to select.

One of the most powerful features of Vim is its ability to use ex commands. First, in order to run ex commands, you must be in insert mode: that is to say, not at the beginning of a line. 
It‚Äôs important to note that in order to enter insert mode, you must first exit normal mode. To do this, press ‚Äúi‚Äù or ‚Äúa‚Äù ‚Äì these keys will start you off in insert mode at the beginning of a new line or at the end of your current line.
Now that you‚Äôre in insert mode, you can type ‚Äú:‚Äù and then an ex command.
Some things you can do are:
:5p print the fifth line
:100p print line 100
:%s/hello/world/ search and replace
:!bash return to bash, type exit to open vim
This saves you quit a few keystrokes. Press the number of times you want to repeat, then press the key. To move 100 lines down, press 100j. To move up 50 lines, press 50k. To delete 5 lines press 5dd etc.

Vim supports keyboard macros. They let you record and replay your keystrokes. This is really great if you have some tedious typing to do.
To start recording press q followed by a. To stop recording press the ESC key. Then press @ followed by a to replay the keystrokes.
If you are new to vim, I recommend this course]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[‚å®Ô∏è Improve the User Experience (UX) of an e-commerce application by implementing animations utilizing Angular animations, CSS animations, and Web Animation APIs.



  
  
  
Developers can use animations in meaningful and non-distracting ways to significantly improve their application's user experience (UX). This blog post discusses four effective techniques to animate your application's user interface, covering popular use cases. You'll learn how to transform bland experiences into memorable ones for your users.
I created a demo application to help you focus on adding animations to Angular. You'll add animations to a starter app as you progress through this tutorial. The starter application uses Tailwind to take care of its style and layout, but none of the animations discussed here are dependent on it.
Follow this tutorial without cloning any repo, right in the browser using Stackblitz or CodeSandbox.
If you prefer to work locally in your IDE, clone the demo app and check out its starter branch:
git clone -b starter git@github.com:auth0-blog/angular-animations-storefront.git

Once you clone the repo, make angular-animations-storefront your current directory:
cd angular-animations-storefront

Install the project's dependencies:
npm i

Run the project locally:
npm run start

Angular comes with a powerful animation module that lets you quickly add motion to your application: BrowserAnimationsModule. Under the hood, this module uses the Web Animations API (WAAPI) to create motion and interactivity. Whenever WAAPI isn't available, BrowserAnimationsModule falls back to using CSS keyframes. Angular animations give you the option to use their abstraction layer to animate any properties that the web considers animatable such as positions, sizes, colors, and many more.

First step install Angular universal.
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine@next

Next step was set up the build in netlify
npm run build:ssr

The page is ready with server side render, but my client application need to request the articles, The TransferState service help to send information from the server to the client.
  imports: [
    BlogHeaderModule,
    BrowserModule,
    InfrastructureModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    BrowserModule.withServerTransition({ appId: 'dw' }),
    TransferHttpCacheModule
  ],

Install it as part of the App module and import into  ServerTransferStateModule in server module.
@NgModule({
  imports: [AppModule, ServerModule, ServerTransferStateModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})

Done
Because my app is only text was easy to get more than 95% but keep in mind the following points.
Not all application are the same, my case is a simple blog, so not issues with images, or authentication.
Use https://contrastchecker.com/ and https://alex-page.github.io/sass-a11ycolor for accesibility issues.
If is your first time, try with an easy proyect like a blog or small app.
Take care about how to use or transfer data between components, I got an issue to send data using this.location.getState().
Done!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


In this article, we will see some of the best practices to unsubscribe from subscriptions (aka Observables) and how to keep our code clean and nicely architectured avoiding memory leaks.
In a nutshell, we will use:
the async Angular build-in pipe
RxJS operators (e.g takeUntil)
custom array of subscriptions
the SubSink npm package
the @ngneat/until-destroy npm package
If you have experience in Angular, you already know that RxJS is one of the most powerful packages. It uses the concept of Observables to handle and work with asynchronous and event-based code. More specifically, Observable is an entity that emits multiple data values over time and asynchronously.
It sounds cool, right? Yes, it is cool and powerful, but you already know that!

But as competition intensifies, it is necessary for companies to come up with feature-rich apps to match world-class standards and attract more people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata]]></summary>
