Before I'm accused of being a hater: I am a Tesla owner and shareholder. I'm no Elon Musk fanboy, but I definitely root on Tesla's environmentally-driven mission of accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy. I'll also say that I personally hope this does not result in reactionary regulation of autonomous driving software in the USA because current rules seem reasonable and I don't necessarily trust that changes would happen in good faith.
And major hugops to all the developers and admins doing their best with all of this — I'm posting this on DEV because it's an interesting software story that deserves attention, not to be critical of the engineering tea…]]></summary>

Does it impact #nginx ingress OSS and Enterprise versions ? asked below - https://lnkd.in/gNUTzwzV - no answer yet but  𝑰 𝒔𝒖𝒔𝒑𝒆𝒄𝒕 𝒀𝑬𝑺 ? because nginx ingress docs allows snippet too at https://lnkd.in/gMBQDZVV - hope some experts can confirm soon because OSS nginx ingress is also widely used !


Policy checks - thanks to #kyverno team, e.g. Jim Bugwadia has a good check rule at https://lnkd.in/gtUy-UNu ! Another good reason to use Policy in k8s to safeguard any CVEs.


there are 3 diff. k8s ingress controllers - see my post at
https://lnkd.in/gC5Pcnv8 so make sure you use the correct image names in your checks, e.g. OPA rego, Kyverno rules, e.g. see more at https://lnkd.in/gGUN7wW9


do not use Snippets as said below - https://lnkd.in/gMBQDZVV

Lacking a user interface other than server flags and YAML configuration files, Atlantis uses your VCS as one, listening for pull request notifications and posting feedback as comments.
Using Atlantis has two major benefits over running Terraform in a “generic” CI system. First, it strikes the right balance between specialized and flexible: custom workflows give you a level of control that’s not possible within a tool like Terraform Cloud. Second, it runs on your infrastructure, which allows it to access resources inside a VPC or use cloud-specific dynamic credentials.

Download WSA preview from here:
https://server.deltaonealpha.workers.dev/MicrosoftCorporationII.WindowsSubsystemForAndroid_1.7.32815.0_neutral___8wekyb3d8bbwe.Msixbundle
Then install it using Powershell with the command:
add-appxpackage -Path "<path to the file>"
Downloading and installing app should be through amazon store but for non-US countries its not available in the preview, so you will have to manually download an apk and install it using "adb install".
Install ADB as instructed here: https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/
Open the Windows Subsystem for Linux app and enable developer mode. An IP address and port will be shown, use this to execute the ADB command:
adb connect <IP address:PORT>
Now simply open Windows PowerShell or CMD and type
adb install "<path to APK file>"
That's it, and your APK will be installed, all you need to do now is open Start and find your installed app in the list!
NOTE: Make sure WSA is running. To run WSA open the app and select open "File".]]></summary>

We already know how to do this with jest, but while it is pretty convenient and quite easy to set up, it's also considerably slow and somewhat opinionated. Unlike more lightweight test runners, it also has a built-in code transformation API, a jsdom-based DOM environment and chooses browser conditional exports by default.
So what we need to run our tests without jest is:
Code transformation

Encryption transforms readable plaintext into unreadable ciphertext that only the intended users can understand. This prevents attackers from making sense of the data even if they get access to it. The intended users will be aware of how to convert the ciphertext into plaintext, a process known as decryption.
A simple encryption example is, say alphabet A -> 1, B -> 2, C -> 3, so on.. So the word CAB would be 321. The receiver will convert the 321 back to plain text by mapping the numbers to alphabets -> CAB.

Making mistakes during refactoring will introduce defects in the software if they are not caught during testing. Such regression defects can annoy users, break the software and even lead to customers abandoning the product.
The need for automated testing is especially high for JavaScript. In a dynamic language with functional constructs like JavaScript, it is harder to detect breakages statically. Additionally, JavaScript has many language details and quirks that are not well known or easy to remember.

Well since we are programmers, it always feels to have a project ready so that we can jump right in to start developing our idea. 
This is less of a post and more of a trick to save time. Just create a boiler plate with the required folder structure and file names and packages you are damn sure gonna use in your next project. You can host this on github or somewhere else and have branches and other merging strategies ready too. 
So next time all you have to do is clone the project and you are on your way. 
P.S. This also helps when you feel the idea is not going to work since you did not spend too much time tryng to setup your project. 
Here is a sample of an app project which I use frequently. 
https://github.com/vjnvisakh-boilerplate/flutter
I promise to keep adding to it so that I have to spend the least time setting it up next time.

@dsabyte


Well, currently it does not support so many  features, but some of them i am going to list below.
@dsabyte supports two themes as of now, dark  and light. 


You can see all posts written on @dsabyte 

In this post, you don't just write a single post, rather you create a series of posts. So, whenever any user loads your website, he/she can see all the posts written under that series. 

There is an online editor, where you can write markdown texts for the post. This editor also supports dark and light theme.


When you make a post private, then it will be removed from the posts list, but it's public url won't be lost.

Traditionally, applications were designed and implemented using a Monolithic architectural style, with which the application was developed and deployed as a single component, divided into multiple modules. Monolithic applications are very easy to develop and deploy.
However, such an architectural pattern becomes a burden once the application becomes too large:
Difficult to manage and maintain, due to the large code.
All of the application is built using one programming language, thus the system may suffer from bottlenecks when performing tasks not suitable for this specific language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Migrating to Deno can be hard when you depend on Node modules. Until those Node modules get ported to Deno, you can use these three methods to import Node modules in Deno.
compatibility layer


There is a Node compatibility layer in Deno standard library, which allows you to require() anything which is in node_modules.
import { createRequire } from 'https://deno.land/std/node/module.ts';

const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);

const path = require('path');
const cjsModule = require('./my_mod');
const leftPad = require('left-pad');

It was buggy for me as I wasn't able to import every module, and the need to have node_modules is also a downside, which brings me to...
If you are lucky, the authors of the library may have the source code using ES6 imports (and doesn't import any node builtins) and you can import the source code directly from the URL (remember, you can import any URLs!)
For example, you could import lodash like so:
import cloneDeep from 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lodash/lodash/master/cloneDeep.js';

I got that URL by going to the file on GitHub and then clicking the raw button.
But sometimes, you also need to support all those node builtins. That brings me to...
JSPM is a module CDN which allows you to import any node module in the browser, and by extension that means that you can use it to import to deno too! 
JSPM is the most reliable method so far, it is used in my Web Framework Sleek too!
So if you want to import the wonderful recast library, you can do this:
import recast from 'https://jspm.dev/recast';

And that's it, you can now use recast!

Typescript and mongoose is a headache I'm sure many of us has encountered. This is for one major reason - it severely goes against the principle of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). To illustrate my point, please look at the following example given by the official mongoose docs
import { Schema, model } from 'mongoose';

// 1. Create an interface representing a document in MongoDB.
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  avatar?: string;
}

// 2. Create a Schema corresponding to the document interface.
const schema = new Schema<User>({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true },
  avatar: String

It's used to contain any initialization for the class. The reason this feature is so helpful is because it can access all private internals of the class it's in, as well!
class Unicorn {
  static #isShiny = false;
  static #shinyLevel = 0;

  static {
    const { hasRainbowHorn, hasRainbowTail } = getData(Unicorn);
    if (hasRainbowHorn || hasRainbowTail) {

You can create multiple static blocks in a class, which will be executed in sequential order.
This feature is definitely small - but I thought it was cool and wanted to share it with you all. However, since this post would be so short, I though I should add a...
While we're talking about static classes: do you know the best way to make a class unconstructable? This might come in handy for a utility class with only static methods. The most popular method is:
class Util {
  public constructor() {
    throw new Error('Do not initialize this class!');
  }
}

However, you can shorten it by just extending null:
class Util extends null {}

new Util(); // TypeError!

You can compare Python with other programming languages, but the readability of its code makes it easier for beginners to start their journey in coding. It also has a well-documented syntax that makes it easier for learners to understand the language.You can start learning python from Pythonscholar.com they explain each topic with multiple examples.
Python is one of the most popular programming languages that can be learnt by anyone. It is especially popular for scientific computing and data science due to its simplicity.
Python was created in 1991 by Guido von Rossum. It has an easy syntax with which you can write up to 100 lines of code without needing to use curly brackets {} at the end of each line.For more dept about python history you guys can refer this artical in what is python.
The environment for Python is cross-platform, so if you are working on Linux or Windows, you will find Python coding very similar to what you are used to. The downside is that it takes longer than other languages like C++ or Java, but once you learn it, Python will become your favorite language because it's flexible and able to solve many problems that many other languages cannot.

Python is a very powerful and popular programming language. It is used in websites, games, and even the International Space Station!
Python is easy to learn for beginners because it has a simple syntax and gets rid of the need for semicolons. Python also doesn't require any import statements when writing programs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Backstory


Have you ever experience difficulties in software development due to unsupported / different version ? Recently I was facing the same issue. The issue was a different Node.js version from my machine (Node v14.18.0) with my company project repository (Node v10 required). The first solution that instantly pop up in my mind was "I think downgrade my current node by uninstalling it will do the work", But what if you need another version for another project in the near future? Do you want to endure the pain of installing and uninstalling Node.js every time you need a different version of it ? 

NVM is a version manager for Node.js, it allows you to quickly install and use different versions of node via the command line.
Let's head to the tutorial !
If you happen to use UNIX, macOS, or WSL (Window Sub-system for Linux), you can install and read the official documentation here
If you happen to use Windows you can install it at NVM for windows which is developed by Corey Butler, download the nvm-setup.zip file.
 

After the installation you can open your command prompt and check whether nvm is recognized
C:\Users\YourUsername>nvm -v

Running version 1.1.8.

If nvm is not recognized as internal command or external command, try to re-open your command prompt.
Then, You can type nvm list in order to see list of Node.js version on your machine.
C:\Users\YourUsername>nvm list

  * 14.18.0 (Currently using 64-bit executable)
    10.18.0

If you don't see your desired Node.js version in the list, you can use nvm install command, for example if you want Node.js version 8, you can type nvm install 8.0.0
To use the installed Node.js version you can simply type nvm use 8.0.0
If you see an error message exit status 5: Access is denied., It is due to admin privilege issue. To solve it you can simply run your command prompt as administrator. 
Thank you for your time reading this short article / tutorial about Node Version Manager, hope it helps! and Have a great day.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Your terminal can do some really cool things. The | operator was a stroke of genius. It lets you take the output of one command and feed it to another, chaining together a few simple tools to perform a bigger automated task.
Shell scripts are a natural extension of your terminal's power. Creating ready-to-run recipes for later use? Sweet. But once you start using these scripts for more advanced things, you run into some unfortunate Bash quirks. For example: when a part of your script produces an error, the rest of the script will still be executed, making its behavior unpredictable.
There are some habits that you can adopt right now to make writing shell scripts easier.




Here's the gist of it if you don't need further explanation:
Add set -euo pipefail to improve how your script deals with undeclared variables and non-zero exit codes.
Add IFS=$'\n\t' so that array elements are split in a predictable way.
When defining functions, return data with echo instead of return. The return keyword doesn't do the same thing as in other languages.
Returning arrays from functions is not really possible. As a bad but easy workaround, you can pass array return values via a global variable.
Keep your whitespace in mind. Confusingly, if [ FOO=='bar' ] will overwrite the value of $FOO. if [ FOO = 'bar' ] will perform a string equality check.
Alternatively, for complex tasks, you'll probably have an easier time using a different scripting language like Python, Ruby or Perl.
Unofficial bash strict mode
Your bash scripts are rubbish, use another language]]></summary>

GIMP is very useful, but sometimes doing not well. Or you find a way to capture screenshots via CLI, but the way using xwd command does not work.
In such a case, this article might be your friend.
This article provides you the way to capture screenshots using xwininfo and ImageMagick.
As previous, xwininfo and import of ImageMagick are required.
On Debian and Ubuntu, it needs to install x11-utils and imagemagick packages. To install these, run:
sudo apt install x11-utils imagemagick

Now, we are ready to do!
xwininfo.


To get "Window ID", run following command in a terminal:
xwininfo

Immediately prompts shown like following:

Select the window you want to capture by clicking a mouse. Then information of the selected window is displayed following the prompt.

The most important is the first line including "Window id: ...". So the hexadecimal is a Window ID. In the previous example, Window ID is 0x4000001!
import.


To capture a screenshot of the selected window using import command, it needs to pass "Window ID" with -window option.
Run:
import -window 0x4000001 screenshot.jpg

Finally, the screenshot is saved in the current directory!

I will show you "How to capture the whole desktop" by CLI. 
Passing root keyword to -window option:
import -window root screenshot_whole_desktop.jpg

Enjoy!]]></summary>

APIs are becoming crucial to modern app development. Therefore making sure that the data you pass between your APIs is secure and not compromised is a priority.
Unfortunately, APIs face a number of threats such as SQL injection, Cross-site scripting (XSS), Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), Man-in-the-middle (MitM), and Credential stuffing.
The best way to avoid these attacks and improve your API security is to follow some simple best practices.
Prioritize security
Encrypt your data
