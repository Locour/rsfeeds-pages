        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you start learning TypeScript, you will come across two types - any and unknown.
any - The any type allows us to assign literally “any” particular value to that variable, simulating what we know as plain JavaScript.
unknown -  The unknown type is the type-safe counterpart of any. Anything is assignable to unknown, but unknown isn't assignable to anything but itself and any without a type assertion or a control flow based narrowing.
Errghh... Let's understand with an example.
let age: number;
let userAge: any;

userAge = 'This is some age';
userAge = 20;

age = userAge;

And yes, This code works! 🎉 Type of userAge is any so it can be assigned any value - string, number etc.
let age: number;
let userAge: unknown;

userAge = 'This is some age';
userAge = 20;

age = userAge;

The statement age=userAge gives an error. I mean, the type is unknown so what is the problem here? To assign an unknown value to a value with a fixed type, we have to do some quick type check!
let age: number;
let userAge: unknown;

userAge = 'This is some age';
userAge = 20;

if(typeof userAge === 'number') {
  age = userAge;
}

And now this works too! 🎉
When to use what? 🤔
unknown is a better choice if you know what you want to do with that value eventually. 
I hope you learnt at least something. Also, this was my first ever post on Dev! Thank you for reading :)]]></summary>

We've all seen relative file import paths inside react applications. If you structure your apps like me you end up with terribly long paths to import other components. Auto-import can take care of that for you automatically, but isn't it hard to read and let's be honest, very, very error prone?
One way to solve this issue is adding webpack aliases. Now if you created your application using the create-react-app cli, you will notice that there isn't a webpack config to mess with unless you eject it running npm run eject, which will expose the entire configuration and makes you responsible of maintaining it. I prefer not ejecting my react application because I prefer the ease of use using react-scripts, so there must be another way.

I am an open-source developer working on Databunker. Today I got a question from one of the guys on a social network.
It is totally true, you can go DIY. On the other hand, Databunker grew to be a better solution than you can think about.
Databunker is a special application server used for the secure storage of customer data. It is not a full-fledged database. In the backend, it is using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite to store encrypted customer records. The product comes with full GDPR compliance and is built with privacy-by-design architecture.
Any company implementing Databunker has a quick and easy way for GDPR and privacy-by-design compliance in addition to much better security.
Hashicorp Vault is a great product. It is built for completely different use cases.
For example, when saving records in Databunker, Databunker knows to extract user email, phone, login identity, and custom identity and built a secure hashed-based index to do a quick user record lookup.
User record CRUD is just a part of the service. In Databunker, you have a secure session storage API, temp shareable identities API, automatic record expiration and removal, compliance with pseudonymization, DPO management, user-accessible UI, and more.
Besides you can go with a free version with an MIT license.
It is up to you to go with Databunker or build your own solution.
Just do not leave customer data unencrypted.

Bash Scripting is a powerful skill to have as a programmer because we find Linux almost everywhere and to get through it you must have a command over its interface which is generally the BASH shell. Vim is a great option for doing this, or probably the best out there! Because Vim is pre-installed in almost every Linux distribution. This is not an in-depth setup for BASH on Vim, it is a simple editorial on starting up BASH scripting on the Vim editor. So without wasting time on "Vim features" let's dive in with the setup for BASH in Vim.
Setting up a bash script doesn't require much code but still in some cases it can be a bit hassle and to avoid the repetitive task, one can easily set up a macro for the boilerplate BASH script.

Here with another write up and this time it will be Mirai from HackTheBox.
Difficulty level: Easy
So lets begin!

-sC = equivalent to --script=default
-sV = Probe open ports to determine service/Versions info
-T4 = Set timing for faster output (0-5)
-oN = Output to save it to a file

Open Ports displayed:

Let's head over to the website to see what is there.

Nothing appears to display when going to the site so let's try the following.
Right-click on the page.

Still nothing is displaying.

Alright, lets check out the other ports open on the box.
ssh 10.10.10.48

So no luck with trying to just SSH into the machine. I am going to run a nmap Vuln Scan on the machine to check.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last article we studied what is an AMI and how it helps in creating preconfigured EC2 instances on AWS. In this exercise we will learn how to create a new AWS AMI with preconfigured Apache server on it.
To create an AMI launch and EC2 instance like in the second article of this series. Use the following script in userdata in place of script provided in the tutorial.




#!/bin/bash
# Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd



Right click on the instance and select Images and Templates > Create Image



Select an Image name and Description



Add a tag of you want to add a tag, let rest of the settings remain same. Click create image to create an image



This we will create a snapshot of the root EBS volume and create a image from it


Now wait for a few minutes after that check the AMI tab under Images to see if the AMI is created




One this is done follow second article of this series to create the instance again but in the second step instead of selecting Amazon AMI select My AMI there you will see your AMI select that and in the userdata add this script instead of the one there




#!/bin/bash
echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html

beacuse we already installed apache server in our AMI

Once you are done with the select the public IP address you will see the same page running in the server.


Clean all these Ec2 instances they may cost you money
In the next article we will see how to automate creation of these AMI's]]></summary>

it is not just a “live boot”;
this is not just something to then use to install Linux onto the internal hard drive of a computer.
Rather, this is Linux ready to plug into the USB port of any computer that can be told to boot from that. Every time you boot this system, it will inspect and deal with the hardware that it finds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An interesting feature was added to TypeScript recently that will improve the ergonomics of code that relies on type narrowing or discrimination:
TS 4.4 (currently beta) can infer when a variable's type implies something about the type of another.
A simple example given in the PR description:
function fn(x: unknown) {
    const isString = typeof x === 'string'
    if (isString) {
        x.length  // Ok
    }
}

In TS 4.3.4, accessing x.length is a type error...
Even though we know that if (and only if) isString is true, x must be a string, the type checker doesn't know that!
This is because isString is just a stupid old boolean - it doesn't know or care why it happens to be true or false.
For TS to understand the expression implies something about its inputs, typeof x === 'string' has to …]]></summary>

After researching my options, I decided to try out Algolia. Algolia is a flexible hosted search and discovery API that comes with a generous free community plan. It provides up to 10,000 search requests per month, pre-built UI libraries (which we’ll use in this tutorial), natural language processing and many other features. What’s more, the engineers at Algolia are wonderfully helpful! I’d especially like to extend a huge thank you to LukyVJ, who showed up while I was learning about Algolia live on Twitch and helped me navigate the docs for the UI library.

I am a big fan of the Microsoft Azure platform. It is super easy to pick and choose the pieces that you need to build a great scalable digital platform with little effort. These pieces, or Azure resources to be exact, provide the required service without having to worry about the installation and maintenance of the underlaying infrastructure.
With great power comes great responsibility. That is why it is important to keep in mind that you pay for what you use. In other words: if you create a resource, the meter will start running. It is therefore good to think about this in advance and come up with a cost saving plan. After all, it is a shame to pay for something that you do not (fully) use.

On 24th April, Angular announced the deprecation of their end-to-end (E2E) testing tool, Protractor. It remains unclear whether there will be a successor or if Angular will delegate this to its users. At the time of this writing, WebDriver.IO, TestCafé and Cypress have come up with schematics for the Angular CLI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Secure DevOps Kit for Azure (AzSK) is being phased out through FY21.The AzSK is transitioning to a more scalable and robust solution called Azure Tenant Security scanner (AzTS) which is based on Azure Functions and a central scan model where scans are performed via a managed identity with Reader access to subscriptions configured at management group level. This new approach helps us scale efficiently and with less process overhead to get the same level of visibility to compliance of several thousand subscriptions. It is also designed to help accelerate our migration to native security offerings in Azure such as Policy, Security Center, Management Groups, Azure Resource Graph, etc.
Steps:
Download the Power Shell Scripts from Here ( https://github.com/azsk/AzTS-docs/blob/main/TemplateFiles/DeploymentFiles.zip?raw=1)
Open the DeploymentFolder that you had created and open the ExecutionScript.ps script with Power Shell IDE



Replace the information for




$MIHostingSubId,$HostSubscriptionId - Your Subscription ID
4.After execute the scripts, you will saw the azure services are setup in your resources group.

5.When you open the webapp, the data is still blank.
Start-AzSKTenantSecuritySolutionOnDemandScan -SubscriptionId $HostSubscriptionId1 -ScanHostRGName $HostResourceGroupName1

After end of execution, the messages will display
At the end,Open the webapp again,you will get the results as below

You also probably might have heard that modern frontend frameworks like React or Angular are XSS safe (due to escaping). Still, though there are some XSS caveats worth remembering: 
Imagine you have a form where the user adds an address to his page/Facebook/Instagram etc. You might have HTML code like:
<a href="https://brightinventions.pl/">User page</a>


When taking input from the user which later will be displayed in a href tag (or any other "new link" click tag-like frame) it is important to validate the protocol of the URL. User can simply add their page with javascript protocol and execute XSS.
<a href="javascript:alert('XSS!');">User page</a>
To conclude: to defend against XSS, besides escaping user input do validate the protocol of URL. Let me know if you have any other interesting thoughts when it comes to XSS!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the introduction of CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) policy, frontend code won't have access to a response if correct CORS headers are not embedded in it. If you own the backend code, then it becomes easy to handle since you can just add the headers before sending the response. If it's not owned by you, then you have no way to add headers directly before the response reaches your frontend code. 

Manually inserting them using GUI can be tiresome. The easiest way to get past this is to use a proxy server.
Check out this repo: add-cors
It includes a public proxy server which can be used to fetch data by adding CORS headers so that it's not blocked by CORS policy. A better way is to create your own proxy and use it without relying on a public server. The repo contains instructions on how to go about creating a proxy and host it on Heroku.
   git clone https://github.com/das-jishu/add-cors.git
   cd add-cors/
   npm install
   heroku create cors-everywhere //cors-everywhere is an example. Use a unique name for heroku to create.
   git push heroku master

The code is fairly simple which enables someone to write it from scratch instead of cloning the code and add more features and utility as needed.]]></summary>

This is where AMI comes in an AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image. It allows you to customize your EC2 instance. With an AMI you can add your on configured software, config, monitoring and operating system.
If you create your own AMI then AWS saves all the configurations and software in an EBS snapshot in such a way that it can start an EC2 instance can be configured from that AMI. After that we can launch our EC2 instances from these AMI. These are available to use in a region and can be copied across regions to take advantage of global presence of AWS.
We were already using AMI from the first time we created an EC2 instance. Where we selected Amazon Linux 2 AMI in the second step while creating an EC2 instance. These are three types of AMI available on AWS.
Public AMI provided by AWS 
Marketplace AMI which we saw in the second part of this series where AMI with preconfigured software. 
Private AMI: AMI which we build and maintain ourselves.
So you can see AMI are very powerful we can get preconfigured EC2 instances from it. Which can be put behind a load balancer and an ASG to get a group of preconfigured servers where we can deploy our apps. Next up we will do a Hands on how to create an AMI.]]></summary>

I like Pikaday. This is because it is framework independent and great browser compatibility (includes IE7!).
Pikaday - GitHub
But it can only select the date. And this time i want to choose the month.
For Chrome and Edge or some other browsers, I can use "input type="month"".

input type="month" - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN
But because it can't be used in all modern browsers, and I don't like its selecting years design, I don't want to use it.
Because I only could find month pickers for jQuery, React, and etc, I will try creating it.
In this sample, I don't care about old browsers.
Node.js ver.16.3.0
TypeScript ver.4.3.4
Moment ver.2.29.1
ts-loader ver.9.2.3
Webpack ver.5.42.0

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[vim (aka Vi IMproved) is a highly efficient text editor that has inspired other editors like it, most notably MacVim (which I will refer to as vim from here on) and gVim.
You see, I use a code editor called Vim, which is sort of like an operating system for writing code.  I know it might seem bizarre, but there's a method to my madness:  Vim lets me write code very quickly and with very little effort. It's a great way of working that I wake up excited to do every day.  

Vim is one of the most popular text editors, which is why you’re either using it or wondering why you should be using it. But if you’re not a programmer, why should you care?
It's a matter of preference, but 
You don’t have to open vim to write code
If you’re like us, you don’t want to have to switch between your text editor and your terminal while you write your code.
You can use it over an SSH connection
This is a big plus. With a few commands you're inanother computer and can edit right away
It works on all operating systems
Even the most obsecure operating systems support vim. Like some router with busybox installed
It's completely controlled by key presses
You don't need to use the mouse, vim is controlled by key presses. However if you like clicking around, there's gvim.
Vim does have a steep learning curve, but you can practice vim on sites like vim.is]]></summary>

The official doc, tells me to do as follow:
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
$ ng new my-project

I'm a bit bothered by this, because:
I'm not going to use that much before switching to the newer npm version
I don't want to thing about any possible ways global version of angular cli would collide with local versions installed in projects
Besides, I really like the light-weight approach frameworks like Next.js or NuxtJS are allowing you to just start playing with their code generator.
Luckily, there is this alternative way of generating angular project:
$ npx -p @angular/cli ng my-project

as you can see it here:
it does the job:

Even though angular documentation seems to assume you have no reason of trying out their framework, unless you it's your job and you need all the tooling all the time (maybe they are right about it); here we have an easier way of running their generator command, without turning our environment into angular-shop.]]></summary>

Accept header is a simple list of mime types (application/json, text/html, etc.) or wildcard rules (*/*, application/*, etc.) that a client supports.
Accept header, the client expects to respond with one of the matched mime types from the header.
This header also supports additional parameters that a client can provide per a mime type.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article talks about an efficient way to implement auto-complete feature using Angular concepts. The key components used in this demonstration are as follows:
Angular Material (v12) Autocomplete module.
RxJS for action and data binding.
Angular in-memory-web-api for REST services (Refer to in-memory-web-api).
 

 

 




Let us now see how we go about it:
The front-end consists of an angular autocomplete module. The input event taps the user's keystrokes and emits a new value into an action subject.

AutocompleteService class.

The action BehaviorSubject starts with an empty string. The action$ is an observable built out of this subject.

GET request. Since this is a higher-order observable (i.e., an observable returning an observable), we make use of one of the higher order functions like switchMap.

switchMap (and not other higher order functions like concatMap or mergeMap)? The reason is: switchMap unsubscribes from the previous observable once a new value is emitted by the parent observable.
What this means is - as soon as the user types in another letter or removes a letter, there is simply no need to subscribe and execute the rest call for the previous values. The user is only interested to see the results of the search according to his/her current input. And switchMap does this automatically, and thus gets rid of unwanted rest calls.
We can also get additional control on when to fire the rest service depending on the length of the user's input. For example, in this demo, I fire the rest call only when the user has entered at least 2 characters. If not, then I return an observable of empty array (using of([])).
 


  
  
  Back to the Component:


We tap onto the above observable and use async pipe to subscribe to it. Since we are completely using observables, we can also use the OnPush change-detection-strategy.

Recently, I started a small Angular application that acts as an installer for a distributed API Gateway application. As part of our testing and quality engineering, we always inspect our web applications. However, we hadn’t done much with static code analysis. It was mostly security dynamic analysis over our client and server communication. Fortify is a product that we have used for this since the company that I work for owns it, and recently they added support for Typescript in their static code analysis. So this was a great opportunity to use it on our Angular project.
Fortify is a product of Micro Focus that allows security scans of applications. Many people are familiar with “WebInspect”, which some people use as a synonym for Fortify.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The JS environment teems with libraries and frameworks. However, with diverse options comes confusion along the way. It is imperative to choose the correct form of technology that helps you achieve what you want and helps in achieving your aim. A wrong decision can eat your time and leave your project in shambles. 
Why Choose Angular For Web Development? Let us look into some of the reasons for choosing Angular for your next project and how it will impact your business.
Parented by Google
Fulfills the Requirements
Purposefully informative
Checks and balances
The first impression is the last
using Angular CLI. All the components have predefined styles which help in the fast delivery of the service. Angular Material documentation is replete with the necessary examples which are required.
Package in itself
SPAs
Module Based
Friendly user-experience
Concluding to the final question- is it still relevant given that it has been here for a decade Yes! Absolutely! It is up-to-date and quite efficient in helping you build modern products. It is supported, powered, and parented by Google, and that in itself makes Angular's future bright. However, depending upon your project, the choice of the framework should be taken judiciously. The angular ecosystem is vast and continues to bring a lot to the table. The core team releases biannual versions, making it always excitable for the next updated version.]]></summary>
