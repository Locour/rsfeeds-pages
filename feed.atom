Foi uma oportunidade muito boa para mim já que ainda não tenho contato com o mercado de trabalho de tecnologia e estou em transição de carreira, e com certeza me ajudou a entender como o trabalho de um programador é, tendo uma equipe de devs, designers e metodologias ágeis como SCRUM.
Assim eu lhes apresento nosso projeto, o Orange Space!!!





E aqui no final eu me despeço de vocês 👋🏽!

Every wonder why your meta tags seem to work sometimes, but not other times? It is because ngOnInit is NOT an async function, even with async, neither is a constructor which must return this, and neither is an async pipe in your template. Sometimes the fetches return on time, other times they don't. So, I added this post:
ngOnInit does NOT wait for the promise to complete. You can make it an async function if you feel like using await like so:
import { take } from 'rxjs/operators';

In our previous article, we looked at how to get started using GitHub webhooks.
However, what are the actual real-world applications of GitHub webhooks? In what ways can this technology deliver value to our applications? These are the questions we will be trying to provide answers to in this article by taking a look at some of the most common real-world applications of GitHub webhooks.
Before we dive into the various use cases of GitHub webhooks, let's discuss why GitHub webhooks are a useful piece of technology. For over a decade now, GitHub has served as a central hub for storing, sharing, and collaborating on code-based projects.
It can be argued that GitHub houses the code for most of the software applications, frameworks, plugins, and any code-based technology that we u…]]></summary>

I could end my post here if not for one thing. I signed up to give a lecture on using voice AI for site reliability engineering at conf42. Why would I do a stupid thing like that? Because I had a vision of how the two can work together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While installing some packages on my Raspberry Pi, I encountered an outage with one of the package mirrors in Canada.
It's a problem I haven't faced before, so I figured I'd share how to get around it.
When running the following command:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git

I got the following error:
Err:1 http://mirrors.switch.ca/raspbian/raspbian buster/main armhf liberror-perl
  404  Not Found [IP: 209.115.181.106 80]
E: Failed to fetch http://mirrors.switch.ca/raspbian/raspbian/pool/main/libe/liberror-perl/liberror-perl_0.17027-2_all.deb  404  Not Found [IP: 209.115.181.106 80]
E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?

After some poking around on the server, it turns out that none of the files in the liberror-perl directory existed. I sent the team that manages the mirror an email and noticed that they had just completed a server migration.
In the meantime, I'm going to point myself to a different mirror so I can get things installed and working.
First, head to the RaspbianMirrors Website, which lists all mirrors by geographic location.
Pick something close to you that's not the one that's inoperable. I chose the Free Mirror project since it's also in Canada.
(http|https)://raspbian.freemirror.org/raspbian/

Grab the URL, and head over to your /etc/apt/sources.list on your Raspberry Pi.
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list

Place the following line at the top of the file, making sure to adjust the URL to the one you grabbed from the Mirrors website.
deb https://raspbian.freemirror.org/raspbian/ buster main contrib non-free rpi

Save the file, and run your update and install commands again.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git

Success! The Pi will now install things from the new mirror while the old one gets sorted out. Happy hacking!]]></summary>

Part 0 briefly explained the clone syscall. It's like fork/vfork, but with more options to control the child process. Actually, some implementations of fork propagate the call to clone().
Besides controlling which parts of the execution context get shared from the parent process, the clone call offers the possibility for us to create a separate memory block for the child's stack. The nix implementation of clone has the following signature:
pub fn clone(
 cb: CloneCb<'_>, 
 stack: &mut [u8], 
 flags: CloneFlags, 
 signal: Option<c_int>
) -> Result<Pid>

The signal argument, if specified, is sent back to the parent when the child process terminates…]]></summary>

Hello, everyone! 
workflow, job, step, command, and other basic terms.
First, we’ll talk about the structure of your config file (AKA the CircleCI YAML). It should look something like this:

Config - This part will specify the version of your CircleCI config. Any Orbs, and their versions (I’ll talk about orbs later), and any parameters you wish to define “CI wide”
Workflow - The main component of every Circle config, this is our entry point where we define workflows (there can be multiple; nightly, tests, etc). Each workflow is composed of multiple jobs.
Jobs - A series of steps/commands that will be executed on a specified machine. You can write out your own steps, or use predefined commands.
Commands - Those are steps that you have previously defined and will reference in your jo…]]></summary>

The goal of this library is to use native async functions (if ES7 is available) and/or native Promise (ES6) including Promise.race() and Promise.all() to implement the concurrency behavior (look our source code).
asyncPool runs multiple promise-returning & async functions in a limited concurrency pool. It rejects immediately as soon as one of the promises rejects. It resolves when all the promises completes. It calls the iterator function as soon as possible (under concurrency limit). For example:
const timeout = i => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(i), i));

This is the React comment box example from the React tutorial.
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

A Subject is like an Observable, but can multicast to many Observers. Subjects are like EventEmitters: they maintain a registry of many listeners.

Every Subject is an Observable
Given a Subject, you can subscribe to it, providing an Observer, which will start receiving values normally. From the perspective of the Observer, it cannot tell whether the Observable execution is coming from a plain unicast Observable or a Subject.

Hmmmm.... let's see who wins with the piece of code below. 🔈
// setTimeout is a web API which waits for the time as given // in 2nd parameter and then moves the callback function in 
// call back queue   
setTimeout(() => console.log('1'), 0);
setTimeout(() => console.log('2'), 10);

// Promise is a class in JavaScript so the functionality is 
// native, to handle the functions executed we have a Job 
// queue
Promise.resolve('hi').then((data) => console.log('3'))

console.log('4');


If you execute this code the logs will be
4
3
1
2

This proves that JobQ has priority over callback queue if call stack is empty, Of course!.

And later help with: Timezone awareness, priority, channel selection, templating, subscription management, in app widgets and etc...
Would to hear your thoughts about the API and library. Any help will be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While TypeScript is a godsend for React developers, its syntax is fairly intimidating to newcomers. I think generics are a big part of that: they look weird, their purpose isn't obvious, and they can be quite hard to parse.
This article aims to help you understand and demystify TypeScript generics in general, and their application to React in particular. They aren't that complex: if you understand functions, then generics aren't that far off.
To understand generics, we'll first start by comparing a standard TypeScript type to a JavaScript object.
// a JavaScript object
const user = {
  name: 'John',
  status: 'online',
};

// and its TypeScript type
type User = {
  name: string;
  status: string;
};

As you can see, very close. The main difference is that in JavaScript you care about the v…]]></summary>

So I decided to put logout logic inside guard, this way I will be able to just call logout route and done!
For this I've configured my authentication module routes like this:
{
    path: 'login',
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false }
  },
  {
    path: 'register',
    component: AuthComponent,

  {
    path: 'logout',
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false },
    canActivate: [LogoutGuard]
  }

I love to keep things as simple and low as possible 😁
For log out I've added canActivate field and passed the LogoutGuard, the guards have the ability to return UrlTree. It is awesome, let's see how the guard implemented:
@Injectable()
export class LogoutGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {
  }

  canActivate(): UrlTree {
    this.store.dispatch(logout());
    return this.router.createUrlTree(['auth', 'login']);
  }
}

That's it!
The canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!
After this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.

Preloading is great. It lets us fetch parts of our application before it is even requested for. By doing this, our content is ready to be served when needed without any delay. There are many ways of doing this, I'll be touching upon some of the ways to do this in Angular and how we can create our own custom preloading strategy based on the user's network state.
Angular provides us with route-based preloading out of the box. There are two strategies namely PreloadAllModules and NoPreloading.
NoPreloading, as the name suggests does not preload any modules. This is the default behaviour.
PreloadAllModules, on the other hand, preloads all modules. A simple example adding a preloading strategy in a routing module file can be seen below

  Telegraph.nvim


Check out the project readme
I want a simple way to make remaps into shell commands that can open new tmux
For example I want to make remaps to do things like open the current file in lookatme.
# vim :terminal
nnoremap <leader>s <cmd>Telegraph pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark<cmd>

# tmux session
nnoremap <leader><leader>s <cmd>lua require'telegraph'.telegraph({cmd='pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark', how='tmux'})<CR>

# tmux popup
nnoremap <leader><leader>S <cmd>lua require'telegraph'.telegraph({cmd='pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark', how='tmux_popup'})<CR>

The main goal here is that remaps become one liners that can just be put
init.vim without creating a whole new lua module for each
telegraph takes in a how argument to determine where to tun the command.j
term(default) runs command in the built in terminal
tmux runs command in a new tmux session and joins it.
tmux_popup runs command in a tmux popup window.
tmux_popup_session runs command in a tmux session and displays it in a popup
subprocess runs command in a subprocess
The current set of format strings that can be used with telegraph.  Placing
{} within your command will get rendered into something with
cword - the current word under the cursor
cWORD - the current BIG Word under the cursor
cline - the current line under the cursor
filepath - the filepath of the current file
filename - the filename of the current file
parent - the parent directory of the current file
current_session_name - name of the current tmux session
cwd - the current working directory

it a star if its something that interests you.]]></summary>

A little bit about me. I'm a newcomer to the DevOps world and right now I try to understand what should I, as a junior DevOps, know and use to monitor IT infrastructure successfully.
My first major tasks sounded frightened to me at first. But, later, I understood that I just need to find the right solution that is accompanied by automation, so I can confidently rely on it. So, my goal was to find a SaaS to monitor a big IT ecosystem, prevent downtimes, analyze log data, etc.
I went through different blogs, forums, review websites, and the systems I came across everywhere were Datadog, New Relic, Zabbix, ELK, etc. Thanks to my team, we decided to test all of them and then decide which one is our favorite.
We started with Datadog. I can admit as a person, who doesn't have a strong…]]></summary>

Isomorphic rendering makes use of Universal JavaScript, as it renders on both client-side or server-side. Dynamic rendering, on the other hand, is often considered to be a workaround for social media crawlers or search engines that are not running on JavaScript. This rendering method is recommended by search engines like Google or Bing. 
Both these rendering methods have their specific advantages, so choosing between them can be a bit difficult. This guide will help you make decisions on how to render your website by discussing these rendering method…]]></summary>

l -> move to right
0 -> move to the beginning of the line
$ -> move to the end of the line
w -> move to the next word
b -> move to the back word
e -> move to the end of current word
gg -> move to the beginning of current buffer
G -> move to the end of current word
:q -> exit from the editor
:w -> save the editor
In this mode you can enter text, delete and edit the document.
i -> enter insert mode to the left of the cursor.
a -> enter insert mode to the right of the cursor.
I -> enter insert mode to the beginning of the line.
A -> enter insert mode to the end of the line.

Next.js allows you to register redirects using redirects function inside next.config.js


Nuxt.js allows you to register redirects using redirect-module in nuxt.config.js


Universal allows you to register redirects at server engine router level. e.g. @nguniversal/express-engine



But in all the cases when your app is served, it should stay on top of a nodejs server to handle all the requests.
But I want my application to be a static served application that lives only on client, without a server 😢
Well, this is the single limitation of all the frameworks redirects, but don't be sad, we have a solution, that comes with it's own limitations 😄

Initially, I saw that he was using Git Bash ... mostly unsuccessfully. In particular, the Angular CLI was failing with command not found. He apparently had figured out some creative npx commands.
I wanted something simpler for him.
Knowing he had NodeJS installed, we set the path to the Angular CLI and made a custom shortcut to the NodeJS Command Prompt.
We followed the rabbit hole and found the Angular CLI in the following location ...
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\@angular\cli

Then, we opened the Environment Variables and added this to the Path. This ensures that we are able to reference the CLI in the command prompt later.


Then, we located the NodeJS Command Prompt shortcut ...
C:\Program Files\nodejs

We then copied the shortcut and placed it on the desktop to make things a bit easier.
The biggest change we made to the shortcut was to set the "Start In" folder to the root of his projects folder ... we got to these settings by Right-Clicking and selecting Properties.

This simple setup gave him much more flexibility without any hassles for Angular development using the CLI.]]></summary>
