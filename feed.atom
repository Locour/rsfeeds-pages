        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The final topic is the dreaded infinite loop. Loops are great tools when you need your program to run a code block a certain number of times or until a condition is met, but they need a terminal condition that ends the looping.
It's the programmer's job to ensure that the terminal condition, which tells the program when to break out of the loop code, is eventually reached. 
Ex: The myFunc() function contains an infinite loop because the terminal condition i != 4 will never evaluate to false (and break the l…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes it's necessary to save information, increment counters, or re-set variables within a loop. A potential issue is when variables either should be reinitialized, and aren't, or vice versa. This is particularly dangerous if you accidentally reset the variable being used for the terminal condition, causing an infinite loop.
Printing variable values with each cycle of your loop by using console.log() can uncover buggy behavior related to resetting, or failing to reset a variable.

Branching programs, i.e. ones that do different things if certain conditions are met, rely on if, else if, and else statements in JavaScript. The condition sometimes takes the form of testing whether a result is equal to a value.


This logic is spoken (in English, at least) as "if x equals y, then ..." which can literally translate into code using the =, or assignment operator. This leads to unexpected control flow in your program.
