Some require features not supported by all browsers, others require complicated tools. For my latest Mojolicious web app, I wanted to see how I could use Typescript with a minimum of fuss.
We'll start from a simple Mojolicious::Lite app, created using mojo generate lite_app:
From there, we can install Typescript using Node. Since Typescript cannot bundle itself into a single file, we will also install Webpack:
npm install --save-dev typescript webpack webpack-cli ts-loader

After installation we can configure Typescript using its tsconfig.json file. We'll use the public directory for our output, since this directory is served by Mojolicious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I had to work with some automatically generated types whilst using GraphQL. This is a very extremely useful feature! However, it can be a little cumbersome to specifically reach different custom nested types from the requests without it being too verbose.
But, being a little creative with some native Typescript functions we can find a way to handle this exact use case!

Let‚Äôs take for example this generated type (For the sake of the example, this will be a fairly simple type with a nested subtype):
If we wanted to extract the type of the array without it getting too verbose we could use some conditional typing from Typescript.

The following type allows us to extract it:
It can be a little confusing at first glance but let‚Äôs break down every portion. First, we have our ArrayElement which is a generic receiving the array itself as T.
Here the infer keyword from typescript (which must be used with extends) to declaratively introduce a new generic type U based on the given array.
Now let‚Äôs assume that the TStuff type is an array and we want to extract a singular TStuff. We could then supply the type of TStuff[] to ArrayElement
type TNestedStuff = ArrayElement<TStuff[]>;

Looking at the result of the extracted type we can now use it however we wish or even assign it as its own type to make it less verbose!

Here is the code sandbox to play around with the type and the Typescript documentation :

If you have any other way to extract a type from an array let me know in the comments below!

Typescript is superset of Javascript which means it is an extension of Javascript, adding new features and syntax on top of the core language.
Typescript is a strongly typed, object-oriented & compiled language.
Typescript is designed to be compiled into fully compatible Javascript, so it works in any browser, any host, and any OS. 
We need typescript compiler to compile it to Javascript code because browsers do not understand typescript.
Typescript strongly encouraged static-typing which means it will validate all the assertions before the code executes. It allows you to do a type check during‚Ä¶]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have a requirement to create Live date or True time digital clock not exactly like above animation but at least show you running time live. For this you have to know basic Linux Command, Shell syntax & Manual of Date command.
So Let's Accomplished the Task ! (bold text are command).
If you want to create a delay in program we always use sleep Command an if you want to echo-back the command we always use $(date). But if you have requirement to remove a new-line in terminal we have -n option in echo. or If you have some other requirement to do operations like New-line, Backspace & Tabulation. Then we have a options called -e stand for Sequence and you have to pass a sequence Character in string
For Example :-
    echo -e "Hello\nWorld" = To add a New-line.
    echo -e "Hello\bWorld" = To Backspace a letter.
    echo -e "Hello\tWorld" = To add a Tabulation.

After know this syntax we are able to create live running time Clock. So let's begin .
echo $(date +%r) = It will give the output of this date command format.
echo -e "$(date +%r)\b\b\b\b\b\b" = It will backspace the output (if command not work use below one).
echo -n  -e "$(date +%r)\b\b\b\b\b\b" = It will backspace the output (Why we have to do this you will know in a minute).
echo -n  -e "$(date +%r)\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b" = It will backspace all the output of command.
echo -n  -e "$(date +%r)$(sleep 1)\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b" = It will add 1s delay in command.
Now we have to add this thing in Loop. So it will keep on running .
While :
    > do
    > echo -n  -e "`date +%r``sleep 1`\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b"
    > done

Now you will see the magic here the command is keep on running (Tick Tock).
If you want to save this command for some project like when creating your own module that time this mite be useful for you, So select a command and copy and create a file you can give any name and past it and save the file. To execute this file you can use bash filename.]]></summary>

An entry level programmer would just fetch username and password stored in database at the time of login and if they match would give him access , which is not wrong but only half  a step in the process of authentication.
It is also necessary to ensure that of all the data stored in database only data related to user is shown.
This can be achieved in two ways:
Today we will talk and implement token based authentication in NodeJs.
1- Install following packages and dependencies which we are going to work with - 
npm install --save express jsonWebToken dotenv
npm install -D nodemon

Hey i got an account before i have created one using GitHub account. This is the account which i created, its been 2 months since i created it and for some unknown reasons i didnt came to quovery until 1 week back. I came and asked for help in discord to approve me as i have been waiting since week even after filling the forum which they gaved. So i came yesterday and asking help to login my account in quovery discord server and my comments are getting deleted and after asking why do i need to wait for weeks even if i have an account then some ambassador banned me without any notice 
Just because i questioned i got a bann even without doing anything bad. I just want JUSTICE. 
It seems they also deleted my posts in their forum and github too, they like a dictator
I just want to use website for my bot which is not against any rules or terms of service but without helping me or telling me what to do some ambassador straight banned me
I dont know if that ambassador got any issues or got grudge. I just want JUSTICE its my right to use website if i didn't do ANYTHING wrong
people who faced my situation please share and also join me to help this UNJUSTICE which companies are doing once they reached some popularity

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are different ways to connect react backend and NodeJS frontend. In this blog, I am going to tell you three ways how you can connect backend and frontend. These are the ways most of the developers prefer.
React and NodeJS

The first way is having a single server that serves both Node API and React SPA under same domain. Here data is still exchanged through JSON. As you can see in the above picture, all the routes which do not start with /api will be handled by React SPA.
CORS errorsü•∂.
Copy build folder files from react app and paste them in public folder of NodeJS server.
Now server the static index.html which in the public folder




app.use(express.static(path.join('public')));
app.use((req,res) => {
   res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html'));
});

Single server.
No more CORS errors üòÖ
Ideal for small applications.
As both frontend and backend will be handled by the same server, you may face performance issues.

As we use two different servers for backend and frontend, we get better performance.
Ideal for bigger applications.
Have to maintain two different servers.
The third way and the least preferred way is server-side rendering with template engines like ejs, handlebars, pugjs etc... Here we don't create any REST API.
So, what other ways you know and what is your preferred way? Comment below üëá
Hope this helps you!

Circling back to the GCB's pipeline, all the configurations are written in JSON or YAML format. Here is an example for the GCB configuration.

Synonyms
Ex 1: Launch windows instnace

Step 2: Choose a region that is near?  ( Asia pacific - Mumbai )
Services -- EC2 --- Launch Instance 


Stage 1  -- Select AMI  ( Note: Select free tier eligible ) Win Server 2012
Stage 2  --  t2.micro
Stage 3   --  No of instances  --  1
Stage 4  --  Storage - 30GB ( Observation - we have root - it is same as C Drive)

Stage 5  --  Add Tag --  Giving name to the machine 
        Add Name Tag
        Value - MyWindows
Stage 6  -- Security group  --  ( It deals with ports )
        We have 0 to 65535  ports
        Every port is dedicated to special purpose

        RDP -- 3389
        SSH -- 22

        HTTPS - 443

        For windows machine , we need to open RDP port  ( Remote Desktop Protocol )
        He by default , we have RDP

Stage 7     Just observe the warnings, Just verify the options, Launch

Create a new keypair--  download key pair -- launch instance
We get the instance ID  i-0dddc6c37c9dfb460
Now, the new windows machines ,is having its own DNS Name, Username and password
We need to provide all the above 3 details in our laptop, so that we can connect.
We use an application called Remote Desktop Connection
AWS , gives us  DNS name , username, it does not give the password.
AWS gives an option to convert .pem to password





  

  How to connect .pem to password
Connect to instance Get password -- upload pem file -- Decrypt  
Open Remote Desktop
Hurray!!
Lets check the hardware configuration
To disconnect, just close the remote desktop window.

One of the more common practices in software projects is to keep certain information separated but accessible from the codebase which uses it. This is usually done with secrets such as passwords or private keys, but is also commonly done with user or context-specific info pieces. However, management of environment variables can be confusing. The solutions to deal with it are many, and there are even built-in ones such as bash_profile. 
direnv, a shell extension which enables the definition of a list of environment variables scoped by a directory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to understand the Angular terms and philosophy. One of the most basic building blocks of Angular seems to be a directive.
The Angular glossary says that "A [directive is a] class that can modify the structure of the DOM or modify attributes in the DOM and component data model".
Seems VueJS also has the concept of directive.
directive is some special token in the markup that tells the library to do something to a DOM element."
This includes a reference to the AngularJS framework, and, yes, it seems AngularJS also has this term.
AngularJS docs:  "At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children."
Ok, so it seems that the term originally comes from AngularJS, and Angular and VueJS just inherited it.
I guess, in Layman terms, a directive is a way of "teaching the HTML to do new tricks" (not mine). 
directive?
Still not sure, maybe the creators thought of this term because a directive it's like commanding (giving directives/instructions/orders) to a static technology (HTML) in order to make it smarter.]]></summary>

Another change that should not add extra scope, is to remove DELETE from the Access-Control-Allow-Methods header.

When you're adding authorization to an application, there are two crucial questions:
Are users that shouldn't have access actually out?
Are users that should have access actually in?
If you can't answer with certainty both questions, how can you claim to have a secure application? This is something that you can test manually, but a better alternative is test automation. Concretely, I think the best methodology to get there is using Test-Driven Development (TDD).
