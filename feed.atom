Here are the main points we had trouble with in our monolith:
How do you share code between sub-projects?
How do you manage typescript compilation for dependant projects? E.g. if a depends on b and I make a change to a, I want b to be compiled as well with the latest version of a.
This was an example of my repository structure:
projectA/
projectB/
projectC/

Inside my packages/ directory I had some core shared libraries, like types / shared utils etc.
Ok — so how do you get it all to work together?

I didn't have a good first impression about Relay when I've started using it. I found it difficult to understand, verbose to use, and I didn't saw the benefits from it.
Even though I didn't like it, I was part of a team, and as a team we choose to stick with Relay and see in the long term if it was a good choice or not.
As the time goes by, I've started to get along with it and to understand how to use it. I still didn't have the full idea, but just to realize how I could use it to solve simple problems like data fetching, and to know what I was doing was enough for me at the time.

If you are building an application where you do a lot of calculations on UI, such as creating CAD documents, doing heavy geometrical calculations, or heavy data table manipulations, then you might have observed that the UI sometimes becomes laggy or janky.
This happens because JavaScript is not the only thing that runs on the main thread, but other things like the painting of pixels, style calculations, and many others also run on it. When we run heavy long-running JavaScript on the browser, occasionally we see that frames are missed, which does not provide a great User Experience.

First of all we should check if value ends with some allowed measure units:
type Units = 'px' | 'rem' | '%';

Now, we should be able to split our measure units into two parts: number and unit

type Units = 'px' | 'rem' | '%';

type IsValidCSS<T extends string> = T extends `${number}${Units}` ? true : false;

type Result = IsValidCSS<'10px'> // true
type Result2 = IsValidCSS<'10p'> // false

Lets write generic validator:

Let's define some base types and utils.

This is what I want to implement:
// John
const result = deepPick({ user: { name: 'John' } }, 'user', 'name') 

First of all, we should validate all arguments but first, because they should be in right order. Let's assume we have next object:
type Foo = {
    user: {
        description: {
            name: string;
            surname: string;
        }
    }
}

Now, we need to generate array of all allowed keys.In order to do that, we need to iterate through every key and replace type property with array of keys.
Does it make sense for You?
type FirstAttempt<T> = {

A lot of people criticize this, but I think it's amazing to have libraries that do the same thing but with different approaches. I think this helps the programmer to implement a project with something that follows his reasoning.
But today this is not going to be the subject of the article. Today I am going to teach you how to make a validation system using Yup together with Express.js.
In the past I had written an article about how to do exactly the same thing we are going to do today, except using Joi, if you want to read the article click here.
If you've used Joi in the past you'll feel comfortable using Yup, both libraries are quite similar.

Opentelemetry logs are painful as fuck. Nothing official in terms of documentation :) I swear to god I feel I will find a good implementation and I will DOCUMENT IT FFS.
The other night I jotted down a blogpost for traces + opentelemetry + sentry. I hope folks would love it. Golang, Opentelemetry, and Sentry — The Underrated Distributed Tracing Stack

Also, fluentd ---> OTEL Collector integration? YOU ARE PAINFUL :) Idk what kubernetes service guide I need to revisit because I am sure af not getting anywhere in this respect.
Get done with one more exam.
Setup the log system locally and see if it works.
Upload the rules files.
Go through the exporter fix PR in the weekend maybe. Or if time allows tomorrow.
Thanks for listening to the rant.

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) has been shown capable of blocking up to 99.9% of brute force attacks. Yet a recent IBM/Ponemon Institute study found that only 36% of responding organizations require it. And adoption numbers for the general public aren’t encouraging either, with a report from LastPass finding that only 37% of respondents use MFA for their work accounts. When you add the finding by Verizon that 80% of data breaches involves the use of stolen credentials, these numbers beg the question, why?
If MFA has been proven so effective as a defense against data theft and brute force attacks, why are adoption numbers still so low? A common set of issues revol…]]></summary>

You can use cloud storage for on-premises data backups to reduce infrastructure and administration costs. There is several ways to backup your on-premise infrastructure to cloud, here I’ll use hybrid cloud (part of your infrastructure is on the cloud and part of your infrastructure is on the on-premise) to accomplish it. In this post I’ll show AWS Storage Gateway solutions to bridge between on-premise data to cloud. The common use case is disaster recovery, backup & restore and tiered storage.
There is 3 types of Storage Gateway:

Before show how I implemented it, I’ll show a brief overview about each one.
Databases and applications are often backed up directly to a file server on-premises. You can now simply point these backups to the File Gateway, which copies the data to …]]></summary>

Open .bashrc in the home folder (/home/user./bashrc) with a text editor, and append:

Then, in a terminal:
source .bashrc

Please note that this is an on-going exercises. I'll be updating this once I'm done with the labs, probably on Saturday (26-Jun-2021). Stay tune! 😄
This section will contain multiple labs:
Lab 1 - Deploying a Kubernetes Cluster using k3s
Lab 2 - Deploying a Kubernetes Cluster using kind
Lab 3 - Deploying an Application using Kubernetes Resources
Lab 4 - Access an Application using Kubernetes Resource
Lab 5 - Creating Configmaps and Secrets
Lab 6 - Creating a Namespace within a Kubernetes Cluster
Lab 7 - Deploying Resources using kubectl
Lab 8 - Deploying Resources through a Declarative Approach
Edge Case: Failing Control Plane for Kubernetes
The objective of this lab is to create the following resources:
a namespace
name: demo
label: tier: test
a deployment:
image: nginx:alpine
name:nginx-apline
namespace: demo
replicas: 3
labels: app: nginx, tag: alpine
a service:
expose the above deployment on port 8111
namespace: demo
a configmap:
name: nginx-version
containing key-value pair: version=alpine
namespace: demo
Note: Nginx is one of the public Docker images, that you can access and use for your exercises or testing purposes.

Still, it is limited to being a black box form of monitoring – you’re only testing API behavior that you’d only see externally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SCP comes in handy to copy files to a remote server from a computer or vice versa. You can also copy server files to another server.
All you need is your server’s IP address and user credentials to start copying. Here are some common SCP commands use cases.
scp file.zip user@hostip:/home/directory

This command will copy file.zip in your terminals present working directory to the home directory of the server.
scp user@hostip:/home/directory/file.zip ~/Downloads

You are copying file.zip from the server’s home directory to your local downloads folder.
Another use case of the SCP command is during site migration to a new server. Zip your site’s root directory and copy it to the new server.
Provide login credentials and file paths of both servers to SCP in your computer’s terminal.
scp user@remotehost1:/home/file.zip user@remotehost2:/home

Add -p flag to add port of remote host
scp -p 1122 file.zip user@hostip:/home/directory

Add a -C flag to enable the gzip compression in SSH transfer
scp -C localfile.zip user@hostip:/home/directory

-v Verbose SCP operation
-p <port> Mention remote host port
-P Save the file’s modification and access times
-r Copy recursively
-c <cipher> Specify the cipher for data encryption
So if you are still using an FTP client, use the SCP command in the terminal for a secure transfer.]]></summary>

The imperative approach allows managing resources using kubectl commands directly on the live cluster.  This technique is best suited for development stages only, as it presents a low entry-level bar to interact with the cluster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developers are always looking for simpler ways to do more advanced things in less time, and one of the many ways that they can achieve this is by using a selection of tools to supplement their workflow. The aim of this article is to cover some of the major tools that people use, and to give you an insight into what they can do to make your life easier.
And to seal the deal, all the tools I’ll be mentioning are completely free to use, which is an incredible price for what you’re getting from them.
Git / Version Control
Git is the most well-known version control tool out there. It allows you to store your code on a server (thereby reducing data-loss risks), collaborate with other developers and share your code online. Another huge plus to Git is that it allows you to go and look at other people’s public repositories, and see how they solved certain problems. This can then help you solve the problem in your application, and it can save you lots of time and effort.
Git is open-source itself and it comes with a huge selection of extensions that allow you to modify the functionality of the system in a huge range of different ways.
The fact that Git allows you to go back and review previous versions of your code, see how it’s changed and keep track of issues as well as provide you with lots of automation tools makes it quite clear that Git, or a Git alternative is a must-have for nearly every project.
Whilst you could install a system like Gitea on a VPS and then run your own Git server, there is a selection of different services out there that provide Git repository hosting as a service. These services often come with lots of extras too, and usually a very generous free tier. The most notable Git host out there is definitely GitHub, but it is closely rivalled by GitLab among other solutions.

You might wonder what they hell are decorators and what they do? Decorators are an experimental feature of typescript and still remain subject to change. That being said, decorators are simply just a way to extend your class with meta data or annotate your code. Why on earth would you want to add some extra data of your own to your data? Well for sorting and grouping purposes. Decorators also allows us to achieve Behaviour Driven code. I think decorators are really cool, in most use cases for creating a decorator you will agree with me that it makes your life much easier to deal with and things are managed…]]></summary>

Benefits of AWS Security Hub:
Security Hub reduces the effort to collect and prioritize security findings across accounts from integrated AWS services and AWS partner products.

Security Hub processes finding data using a standard finding format, which eliminates the need to manage findings data from multiple formats.

Security Hub then correlates findings across providers to prioritize the most important ones.

Automatic security checks against best practices and standards
Security Hub automatically runs continuous, account-level configuration and security checks based on AWS best practices and industry standards.

Security Hub provides the result of these checks as a readiness score, and identifies specific accounts and resources that require attention.

Let’s imagine that we want run a bash command. What’s the easiest way to do this? Just by spinning up a container using a lightweight image like busybox, ubuntu, debian? For instance, let’s say we use Debian as our base image.
docker run debian echo hello

We will get back “hello”, which is expected. What would happen if we check if the container is running?

The container has stopped running. Containers are not meant to host an operating system compared to a VM. When you run a basic container like Debian or Ubuntu, it will exit once you perform a docker run debian

That is really good, good until we use it with common sense. In this article I will show how we can create a problem by doing things in contrast to the type system.
We have following types in our codebase
type Movie = {
  uuid: string,
  title: string,
  comments: Comment[]
}
type Comment = {
  uuid: string,
  content: string,
}

Now these types are used by some function which is responsible for showing comments. In our example this function will be React component
const Comments = (movie: Movie) => {
  if (movie?.comments?.length > 0) {

Design Patterns are best software practices used by Software Developers in solving recuring problems in Software Development. They aren't code-related but rather a blueprint to use in designing a solution for a myriad of use cases.
There are about 23 different Software Design Patterns put together by the Gang of Four that can be grouped into three different categories:
Creational Pattern: These are patterns that pertain to object creation and class instantiation they help in the reuse of an existing code. The major creational patterns are Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, and Singleton.

So get ready to resolve all your doubts you are having with TypeScript!

I am assuming that you are totally unaware of TypeScript. TypeScript, As name suggest it is a Type checking language!
TypeScript is not a brand new language! TypeScript is a super-set of JavaScript, which means you can still use the same syntax you have used in JavaScript! 
Before I tell you directly how does things work in TypeScript Let's talk about our favourite language JavaScript.
JavaScript is a Runtime Language! That's means everything happens at runtime. We cannot compile JavaScript like Java, C++, C.

Disclaimer:
I did not actually use what I got, and reported the bug
I do not suggest people try to score free services through exploitations of lousy systems. This is meant to help secure those that are exposed
My hope is that developers become more vigilant with systems, especially ones that involve personal and medical information of literally everyone that crosses their country's border
I do think however, that testing, at home for these kinds of bugs are contributing to the greater good of the internet.

You know which sources to trust when you are reading information on social media, yes, we are talking about verified accounts on social media. In-order to minimize the continuously exploding phishing frauds in the inbox, Certifying Authorities have taken an initiative to issue verified mark certificates for brands to show their brand logo in the email inbox.
To make this challenging task a reality Google announced full support for the movement. This functionality will use BIMI standards (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) to show the verification mark within email clients.
BIMI provides a secure, global framework enabling email inboxes to display sender-designated logos for authenticated messages. It also includes protections to prevent senders from spoofing logos owned by other organizations


What are the benefits of BIMI? 
BIMI offers several important benefits to end users as well as to marketers across the globe.
BIMI can reduce the amount of phishing activities.
It offers improved email security by using existing email authentication technologies like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.
Provides a great opportunity for every marketers email to get read first because of logo recall.
BIMI increases the confidence in the mind of a recipient as they see a verified logo against the sender name.
What are Verified Mark Certificates ?
Verified Mark Certificate in Action

How to get Verified Mark Certificates?
As of now Google & the BIMI group has not rolled out any specific date of its implementation. As per Google the pilot testing has started and will be made live for all by the end of 2020. An organization would require getting VMCs to show BIMI standard logos.
In case you would like to register for BIMI and want numerous VMC then contact us.  We will get back to you with all the relevant details at the earliest.]]></summary>

While it may seem to be a great idea to use IoT-based solutions for tracking and tracing COVID-related data, security can be a concern here. According to a research paper prepared based on a security survey of more than 40 android apps used for contact tracing of COVID patients, tracking symptoms shows that about 55% of them store sensitive data in cleartext.

I moved back from macOS to Linux and I'm loving it!
Mohammed Ismail Ansari ・ Mar 18 ・ 2 min read
#linux
        #macos
        #setup
      
Arch gave me a fresh new direction to explore and experience Linux the way I never did before. I created a couple of reusable artifacts and it in a way became a base for my second YouTube channel.
Things kept breaking, and I found myself spending more time on fixing things than I expected, even with my prior experience with Linux before I spent four years on macOS.




So I started looking out for alternatives and found the exact thing I was looking for.
I couldn't lose the control I had over my Linux setup back with Arch by delegating it to a graphical installer. So I installed Debian in the way we usually do install Arch.




All this learning had to be documented somewhere so I created another video talking about the process in a little bit of detail.
Moving to Debian meant re-setting up the entire machine, even deeper than what I had to do back when I moved the factory-installed Windows to a smaller partition to make space for my primary Linux partition.




The new setup took away a few issues I never got fixed, and in exchange, brought with it a few other ones. I talked about the similarities, differences, negatives, and most importantly, the positives of the migration in a separate video, adding another episode to my series Back to Linux.
As I did last time, I'll keep my eyes open for ways to improve my setup and workflow, and will keep documenting my learning to be able to share them with the rest of the community.
Needless to say, I'm loving the alternate universe with Debian. Do throw in your ideas and thoughts in the comments and hopefully, we can learn something from each other.]]></summary>

Throughout my career as a developer I have heard a lot of people agree that testing our code is something that we should all be doing. Conversely, I have not worked at many places that actually do it. Additionally, and surprisingly to me, rarely if ever do you see a tutorial show any kind of testing when they're trying to teach something unless they're specifically teaching testing.
While I understand that the focus of the lesson may not be testing, I think that if we really want to see testing adopted more widely across our industry then we…]]></summary>

Today NGINX servers the majority of the world's top 1000 websites and while this growth is largely due to, it's also because NGINX is relatively easy to get started with.
There are two methods of installing NGINX on Ubuntu 20.04.
Via the operating system's build-in packages manager.
Via building NGINX from the source.
In this guide, we’ll build NGINX from the source on Ubuntu 20.04.
To complete this tutorial, you will need to have an Ubuntu 20.04 server. for the sake of simplicity, we'll be working as root during this guide.
In order to build NGINX from the source first, we need to install a couple of dependencies for NGINX.

BASH or Bourne Again Shell is an interface(program) between the user and the Operating System. BASH is just an application just like others, but not an ordinary one. It is quite powerful when used to its potential. It is used in various aspects of computing. No, it's not only for server admins, but it specializes in that field though. We'll see how we can use Bash to perform several tasks quite powerfully. Not just automation, you'll be surprised what Bash is capable of.
BASH is just like any other shell such as z-shell, c-shell, Korn shell, and Bourne shell. BASH is a variant or update version of the BOURNE shell.

Most of us have come across terms like multithreading, parallel processing, multiprocessing, concurrency, etc., though each of these terms has its own meaning. In a broader sense, we need these because we want to avoid some kind of latency (or have an illusion of doing so) in the execution of regular programs.
To do this, we try to write code that doesn’t necessarily runs in order (non-sequential) and all this boils down to two different concepts — concurrency and parallelism.
I came across concurrency when I was trying to download ~5000 images from the web. I had collected image URLs from Flickr, and these images had to be passed on to a team doing annotation (labelling).
This is how a sequential program to download images would look like:

I've got some topics in my mind but I cannot convey them into words. My writing is not good enough. So I'm thinking of implementing some real product while writing about it at a same time. I can post all the design considerations here and will receive feedbacks which will help me (and maybe other people) a lot.
The problem is that I cannot think of any ideas about software/applications that are not only practical but also useful for real-life use cases. Simple case studies are good but I'm afraid of that the readers will lose the interest. So any suggestion would be welcome and appreciate.
Thank you very much.]]></summary>

Before discussing dependency injection lets understand what are dependencies first
Dependencies are services or objects that the class needs to perform its function
Dependency Injection is a design pattern in which a class/ component request dependencies from external sources rather than creating them.
In Angular, Component or services are injected with dependencies via the constructor arguments.  Angular DI's framework will provide dependencies calling the factory function to instantiate the dependencies. 
How Services are exposed to Inject?
Its using @Injectable decorator and dependency injection provider which is declared in service.

Increasing the use of MEAN Stack is one of the primary examples of this scenario. MEAN JS is utilized to craft robust and scalable web applications. Let’s explore what exactly is Mean Stack and how it can assist your business.
What is the MEAN stack?
Mean stack is the compilation and synergy of technologies applied to build web applications. MEAN is used by several Web App Development Companies, and it precisely stands for “MongoDB Express.js AngularJS Node.js.”
How does Mean stack architecture work?

The Mean Stack Architecture works in five stages.
Stage 1: Angular as a client-side language is the foremost one to work on the client request.
Stage 2: The client request then goes into NodeJS being the JavaScript server-side language.
Stage 3: ExpressJS is then into the process and makes a database request.
Stage 4: Then MongoDB retrieves the data and sends the response to ExpressJS.
Stage 5: NodeJS returns the data to the AngularJS to showcase the outcomes, and in return, the data is taken back from the ExpressJS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata]]></summary>
