        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, In today's blog, we are going to learn about policy as code in Kubernetes using Kyverno.  Let's get started.
Policy as Code (PaC) is the idea of writing code in a high-level language to manage and automate policies. The DevOps team can adopt the best practices by representing policies as code, such as version control, automated testing, and automated deployment. You can use these policies in audit or enforcement mode to monitor existing workloads, services for misconfiguration or prevent the misconfigurations applying in the cluster. 
Policies could be established for multiple areas of your operational environments. You want your Kubernetes clusters to be reliable and secure and you want to control who has access to what. You also want to enforce rules for your kubernetes resour…]]></summary>

As mentioned previously, Typescript is a superset of Javascript, so we are able to access JS's primitive types available in JS. 
string - anything enclosed in  ' '  or  " "

null - an absence of value
undefined - when no value is assigned before using variable or object

While this might be your first thought for modernization, it is also time-consuming and super expensive to start afresh. Not just that, you'd be letting go of the ability to process safe, secure, and quick transactions.

This article aims to help you understand and demystify TypeScript generics in general, and their application to React in particular. They aren't that complex: if you understand functions, then generics aren't that far off.
To understand generics, we'll first start by comparing a standard TypeScript type to a JavaScript object.
// a JavaScript object
const user = {
  name: 'John',
  status: 'online',
};

// and its TypeScript type
type User = {

So I decided to put logout logic inside guard, this way I will be able to just call logout route and done!
For this I've configured my authentication module routes like this:
{
    path: 'login',
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false }
  },
  {
    path: 'register',
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: true }
  },
  {
    path: 'logout',
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false },
    canActivate: [LogoutGuard]
  }

I love to keep things as simple and low as possible 😁
For log out I've added canActivate field and passed the LogoutGuard, the guards have the ability to return UrlTree. It is awesome, let's see how the guard implemented:
@Injectable()
export class LogoutGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {
  }

  canActivate(): UrlTree {
    this.store.dispatch(logout());
    return this.router.createUrlTree(['auth', 'login']);
  }
}

That's it!
The canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!
After this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.
Thank you for reading 🙏🏽

  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {
  }

  canActivate(): UrlTree {
    this.store.dispatch(logout());
    return this.router.createUrlTree(['auth', 'login']);
  }
}

That's it!
The canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!
After this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.
Thank you for reading 🙏🏽

Angular provides us with route-based preloading out of the box. There are two strategies namely PreloadAllModules and NoPreloading.
NoPreloading, as the name suggests does not preload any modules. This is the default behaviour.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been passing props to stateless functional components. These components act like pure functions. They accept props as input and return the same view every time they are passed the same props.
A stateless functional component is any function you write which accepts props and returns JSX. 
A stateless component, on the other hand, is a class that extends React.Component, but does not use internal state (covered in the next post).
A stateful component is a class component that does maintain its own internal state. You may see stateful components referred to simply as components or React components.
FreeCodeCamp now shows us the code editor thas a CampSite component that renders a Camper component as a child. They want us to define the Camper component and assign it default props of { name: 'CamperBot' }. We can render any code that we want but it has to have a p element that includes only the name value that is passed in as a prop. We should define propTypes on the Camper component to require name to be provided as a prop and verify that it is of type string.




class CampSite extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Camper/>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
{/* Change code below this line*/}

Answer:
{/* Change code below this line*/}
const Camper = (props) => {
  return <p>{props.name}</p>
}
Camper.defaultProps = {name: 'CamperBot'}
Camper.propTypes = { name: PropTypes.string.isRequired}

The first step was hand-sketching the UI elements on a sketchpad. The sketches don’t look great but they did give me a clear plan for what I needed to create on the screen. The second step was to translate those hand sketches into a digital version that gave me a representation of what the final project would look like on a mobile device. Figma and its community-built tools made that process relatively easy. Now I have some solid reference points for beginning the actual development process. I feel good about where I am in the process so far but a couple of things have changed from my original plan. Let’s take a look at the original outline from part 1:

Container orchestration is all about managing the life cycles of containers, especially in large, dynamic environments.
Container Orchestration can be used to perform a lot of tasks, some of them includes:
Provisioning and deployment of containers
Scaling up or removing containers to spread application load evenly
Movement of containers from one host to another if there is a shortage of resources
Load balancing of service discovery between containers
Health monitoring of containers and hosts
There are many container orchestration solutions which are available, some of the popular ones include:
Docker Swarm
Kubernetes
Apache Mesos
Elastic Container  Service (AWS ECS)
There are also various container orchestration platforms available like EKS.
Kubernetes (K8s) is and open-Source container Orchestration engine developed by Google.
It is originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

Things to configure while working with Kubernetes.



Sr No
Things to Install
Description




1
kubectl
CLI for running user commands against cluster


2
Kubernetes Master
Kubernetes Cluster by itself


3
Worker Node Agents
Kubernetes Node Agent



There are multiple ways to get started with fully functional k8s environment.
Use the Managed K8s Service
Use Minikube
Install & Configure K8s Manually (Hard Way)
In this approach you have to install all the components ok K8s Individually

You have to just download kubectl and that's it. As rest all the things are taken care by Managed Service. Download CLI and just need to connect with K8s master.
Environment Setup
Take care of K8s master also the worker node, then we need to configure the kubectl.

Static Type checker
Tooling
Imagine what happens when we run the following code in JS
function greet(person, date) {
    console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`);
}
greet("Abhirup");

It will throw a typeerror !!
console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`); 
                                              ^
TypeError: Cannot read property 'toDateString' of undefined

Why?  Because the date param of greet is undefined and so toDateString of undefined throws error.But we got to know of this error while running only.
Now if we paste the same code in the .ts file.

It means first class support of typescript by the popular IDEs and code editors.

variables are an important part of the programming language. In general, variables are ways of storing data(value).
variable names can only include letters, numbers, underscore(_), dollar sign($).
variable names cannot start with a number.
variable names are case sensitive. Meaning, letter "a" is considerably different from the letter "A".

The fs module in nodejs allows you to read, delete, update, and create files on your machine, it gives you access to do anything you want with the files. There are several methods within the module that allows you to do this. Allow me walk you through the process.
The cover image was sourced from here
Obviously, you must have nodejs installed on your machine. After which you should import the fs module.
const fs = require('fs');

All of the operations of the fs module can be done either synchronously or asynchronously. 
The synchronous form blocks the Node.js event loop and further JavaScript execution until the operation is complete. Exceptions are thrown immediately and can be handled using try…catch, or can be allowed to bubble up.

  Telegraph.nvim


Check out the project readme
I want a simple way to make remaps into shell commands that can open new tmux
For example I want to make remaps to do things like open the current file in lookatme.
# vim :terminal
nnoremap <leader>s <cmd>Telegraph pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark<cmd>

# tmux session
nnoremap <leader><leader>s <cmd>lua require'telegraph'.telegraph({cmd='pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark', how='tmux'})<CR>

# tmux popup
nnoremap <leader><leader>S <cmd>lua require'telegraph'.telegraph({cmd='pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark', how='tmux_popup'})<CR>

The main goal here is that remaps become one liners that can just be put
init.vim without creating a whole new lua module for each
telegraph takes in a how argument to determine where to tun the command.j
term(default) runs command in the built in terminal
tmux runs command in a new tmux session and joins it.
tmux_popup runs command in a tmux popup window.
tmux_popup_session runs command in a tmux session and displays it in a popup
subprocess runs command in a subprocess
The current set of format strings that can be used with telegraph.  Placing
{} within your command will get rendered into something with
cword - the current word under the cursor
cWORD - the current BIG Word under the cursor
cline - the current line under the cursor
filepath - the filepath of the current file
filename - the filename of the current file
parent - the parent directory of the current file
current_session_name - name of the current tmux session
cwd - the current working directory
Check out the repo and give
it a star if its something that interests you.]]></summary>

We are developing a new developer tool to create a project template. You know react and RN has a lot of node modules. Also, these modules have a lot of versions. That's why developers generally got build errors or run time errors when adding a new package in a project.
Because of that, we are creating this project template tool. You select a language and select a version of the language then add dependencies from the node module. 
The depZARD creates a project template with a compatible running node package with available node modules.So you will have a project template with the compatible node modules you want to use.
I have shared the link of DepZARD's details below. Please subscribe and  support us :)

This is pretty important because; lousiness can be permitted and forgiven, whilst developing locally. However, you would definitely pay dearly, if an attacker should trail your backend-system.

In the past few years, we have seen attacks such as NotPetya and Sunburst, which has shifted the industry’s focus to secure their supply chain. With the growing usage of Open source software, we inherit many third-party dependencies into our application. An upstream vulnerability in one of your dependencies can affect your application, making it susceptible to a potential compromise. A software supply chain is anything that goes into or affects your code from development, through your CI/CD pipeline, until it gets deployed into production. 
The first step in getting supply chain security right is to start with visualizing the supply chain components which you use from scratch. You can use something like Dependency…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you start building your cloud infrastructure, security might not be a top priority as much as getting your project up and running. This might lead you to delay security considerations for later and end up having an insecure cloud environment for a long period of time. The more this is put off, the more difficult and expensive it is going to be to fix this. In worst cases, it might be necessary to re-architect your environment. Worse yet if you do have a security attack, it will cost you considerably more money and effort to respond to these threats. In some cases, external incident response teams have to be brought in and making them do this work is exponentially more expensive. This blog post is to guide you through the basic steps you can take to improve your cloud security posture …]]></summary>

Run create-react-app to create React frontend for your web app.

Add webpack and its relevant packages to your project.
yarn add webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server --dev

Then we learned about CSS to make our websites prettier and visually satisfying. When it was time to make our websites interactive and dynamic, we started diving into the amazing world of JavaScript. But back in the day, JS was used just to code the client-side, meaning that it could only be used in the browser. To interact with the server we needed to use other server-side languages such as Python, Ruby, or PHP. Until Node was born.
But, what is Node and how does it work? Node is a runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript on a physical machine, rather than in the browser. At the same time, it is open-source, whereby millions of developers can create libraries and modules th…]]></summary>

  What is the Caesar Cipher?


The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The number of fixed positions down the alphabet is what we call the key. It was named after Julius Caesar since he was the one who invented it.
So as I said earlier on, each letter during encryption is moved some fixed positions down the alphabet. So for a key of 3, if we are to encipher the letter A, we will shift it down three characters and the results will be D, C would be F and so on...

Dynamic rendering, on the other hand, is often considered to be a workaround for social media crawlers or search engines that are not running on JavaScript.

Vim is the dark side of the programming, you can rule everyone with vim. 
Vim has several modes with different functions but these are the  most commonly used.
Normal mode is Vim's default mode. When you are in normal mode you can navigate, perform operations, and destroy your keyboard.
h -> move to left
j -> move to down
k -> move to up
l -> move to right
0 -> move to the beginning of the line
$ -> move to the end of the line
w -> move to the next word
b -> move to the back word
e -> move to the end of current word
gg -> move to the beginning of current buffer
G -> move to the end of current word
:q -> exit from the editor
:w -> save the editor
In this mode you can enter text, delete and edit the document.
i -> enter insert mode to the left of the cursor.
a -> enter insert mode to the right of the cursor.
I -> enter insert mode to the beginning of the line.
A -> enter insert mode to the end of the line.
o -> enter insert mode one line down.
O -> enter insert mode one line up.
In this mode you can select parts of the document, copy them, cut them, delete them and paste them.

Nesse exemplo teremos dois jobs, em que o primeiro fará o build do projeto, gerará o bundle e preparará os artefatos para a publicação no FTP e o segundo vai pegar esses artefatos e enviá-los para o FTP.

Porque o primeiro será executado na estrutura do Github (Gh) e o segundo usará um executor auto-hospedado que será instalado na sua estrutura On-Premise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently had the honor of working with a neighbor beginning his development journey. He is taking a course through his employer and using a work computer with Windows installed.
Initially, I saw that he was using Git Bash ... mostly unsuccessfully. In particular, the Angular CLI was failing with command not found. He apparently had figured out some creative npx commands.
I wanted something simpler for him.
Knowing he had NodeJS installed, we set the path to the Angular CLI and made a custom shortcut to the NodeJS Command Prompt.
We followed the rabbit hole and found the Angular CLI in the following location ...
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\@angular\cli

Then, we opened the Environment Variables and added this to the Path. This ensures that we are able to reference the CLI in the command prompt later.


Then, we located the NodeJS Command Prompt shortcut ...
C:\Program Files\nodejs

We then copied the shortcut and placed it on the desktop to make things a bit easier.
The biggest change we made to the shortcut was to set the "Start In" folder to the root of his projects folder ... we got to these settings by Right-Clicking and selecting Properties.

This simple setup gave him much more flexibility without any hassles for Angular development using the CLI.]]></summary>

Se servimos arquivos estáticos, pra que diabos a gente precisa subir um servidor?
