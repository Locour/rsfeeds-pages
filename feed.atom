Hard coding API keys on the frontend is a quick and surefire way to have your API connection shutdown, API keys stolen, and have your API provider’s bill skyrocket.

I can't really remember what I was googling when I saw an advert by flexiple .So I sign up and the company recruiter schedule a call with me the following week.
After this process, flexiple prepared my CV by trying to  organize it to suite potential client i would work with in the future. Which was pretty straight forward and fast.
The final stage was divided into two stages
So I had to start preparing for this interview with leetcode and Hacker Ranker. I  started practicing algorithm, learnt recursion, binary search, Hash tree etc. 
To prepare further someone shared a picture of some AlogExpert algorithms  questions and  how it helped him land is current  job .I took a screen shot and started solving this algorithms one after the other .Note  I didn't solve all

To cut the long story short I did the code challenge and I am officially a freelance developer at flexiple looking forward to the journey ahead.]]></summary>

Obviously you may not get as attractive and beginner friendly interface as windows does but everything comes with a price doesn't it.
Here I will list 10 commands and explain them which you could try out yourself on your linux OS right away and experience it yourselves. 
df

this command will show the amount of available disk space and used disk space for file system to which you as a user currently has access to. For eg : if you have a dual boot system established in your pc and your linux OS doesn't have access to the D folder.If you run this command on your linux terminal then you wont be able to see the partiton of used and unused space of D folder. this command is same as when you open the disk management tool in windows.



top

This command when you type in your terminal it will show the active linux processes which are managed by your linux kernel. This command is used like how you would use task manager in windows, the difference being , it shows the details of all the processes in far more depth than windows does.
it will look something like this when you type the command.


this is what is meant by each column head.

you can press 'q' to exit this window in your termial.

Javascript is everywhere, It runs inside your browser, astronaut spacesuit, and most developers use it as a client-side and server-side programming language to allow them to create interactive web pages.
Javascript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language with first-class functions.
In addition, the Javascript ecosystem relies heavily on third-party libraries;

Let's see how I did it.
First, you'll need some help, so run the following commands:
npm i --save dom-to-image
npm i --save jspdf

Once we have this two packages, we can use them in our code 
import { jsPDF } from 'jspdf';
import domtoimage from 'dom-to-image';

Add an ID to the HTML element you want to print:
<ion-content class="grid-container">
    <div id="dashboard">

Finally, the function to turn that HTML into a PDF:
toPdf() {
    const dashboard = document.getElementById('dashboard');

    const dashboardHeight = dashboard.clientHeight;
    const dashboardWidth = dashboard.clientWidth;
    const options = { background: 'white', width: dashboardWidth, height: dashboardHeight };

    domtoimage.toPng(dashboard, options).then((imgData) => {
         const doc = new jsPDF(dashboardWidth > dashboardHeight ? 'l' : 'p', 'mm', [dashboardWidth, dashboardHeight]);
         const imgProps = doc.getImageProperties(imgData);
         const pdfWidth = doc.internal.pageSize.getWidth();

The refactoring "Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses" from Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code (2nd Edition)" can help in those situations.
A guard clause checks for a condition and returns from the function if the condition is true, potentially doing some computation and returning a result. It makes it easier to reason about the function by ending one execution path early.

A YubiKey is a device made by Yubico intended as a form of MFA.
Generally, it's a USB device that is used to obtain access to sensitive resources.
Yubico provides a cli, ykman, for the YubiKey. The intention of ykman is to allow IT administrators to configure YubiKeys for their organizations. 
I thought that it would be cool to have some shell scripts around for common APIs within my organization, but some of these require a credential generated from my YubiKey. My logic was that perhaps ykman could script the YubiKey credential generation for me.
I googled for an hour and only came up with a couple discussions about this. Unfortunately, one of them held some bad news:

The new theme uses the official color palette from Tailwind and based on the design bits at Tailwind UI such as forms, modals and menus. If you are utilizing tailwind ui and looking for a fully featured UI component library, PrimeFaces with the Tailwind theme will be an excellent choice. Note that, the theme does not use tailwind classes and instead provides a look-alike style for a unified design when used together.

Image is a new addition to the UI suite to display an image with transformation options like rotate and zoom. For multiple images, please see the Galleria.

There are over 30 improvements in this release, defect fixes are mostly based on community feedback so thank you for helping us to make the library better.
PrimeNG is licensed under MIT and free to download at NPM.
Our current focus is on improving accessibility by creating a dedicated section per component for keyboard support and screen readers along with scores from audit tools.]]></summary>

If you have experienced significant replication lags and replication so slow that it needed hours to complete or couldn't catch up at all, I may have a solution for you.
A couple of weeks ago, I set up a MariaDB replication from scratch for a production database. The database has a considerable size and is under heavy use.
As usual, I used Mariabackup to copy the entire data directory of MariaDB to the new replica server. Unfortunately, I had to interrupt my work and wasn't able to continue until 12 hours later. As I resumed where I left off, I noticed that the database grew substantially. Since I didn't want to resync about 200 GB of data, I left the rest to the replication.
Well, It did not go as planned. The replication was so slow that it couldn't catch up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time you probably hear about your child’s IQ is when there is some question about their abilities in school, whether it’s above or below expectations. This often misunderstood concept is foreign to most people, perhaps with the exception of those quick tests that they offer online. You know the ones to which I refer. But, IQ in relation to what it means for assessment, academics, and even expectations, merits serious attention.
IQ, short for intelligence quotient, is a measure of a person’s reasoning ability. In short, it is supposed to gauge how well someone can use information and logic to answer questions or make predictions. Real IQ tests begin to assess this by measuring short- and long-term memory.
One should know his/her IQ score and use it to evaluate one’s self, but indiscriminately, objectivity should be maintained. For some people, knowing their IQ helps boost their self confidence and morale, and eggs them on to attempt new things, fight challenges or to tax their mental resources and stretch the arch to scale greater heights. For others, it may have adverse effects. Learning that one’s IQ is below average, can be a shattering experience. They may withdraw into themselves and tag themselves complete losers who would never taste any fruit of success.
Intelligence quotients are definitely useful and can be instrumental in clinical practice and education, but it is important to remember what such tests are and aren’t good for. An IQ score tells a story but not always the whole story. It can be critical for helping someone on the road to success but not crippling. And it can be informative to know and sometimes unnecessary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have developed a free open source chrome extension named context-note, aiming to provide a better way to take, search and review notes on the web.

It could be cumbersome and time-consuming: at least four operations (c&p the text, c&p the website link, write the note, c&p the image) need to be done to finish this single note.
Loss of context details: when reviewing this note, you can only read the sentence and image instead of the whole page, useless you open the link and scroll to the exact place where you have token this note.
By the way, another more easy method is simply clicking star ⭐ of the browser to throw the website link into the bookmark. As you can imagine, without the content and note information, you basically can not remember why you marked down this link someday after two months.
So I think a more efficient tool should be used during taking notes on the web, especially when you are reading articles or learning something new. That is why I built context-note.
https://youtu.be/ZcakhGp_-HQ
It is a chrome extension with three key fetarues:
Notebook, where text content, note itself and context information would be stored.
Tagbook, manage the notes neatly with a handy tag system.
Rich text editor: embed quill as the rich text editor.
Taking notes with their context, I believe it would be a better way to store and review things that really matter to us.]]></summary>

Decorators have been there in programming languages for a long time. Definitions vary, but in short a decorator is a pattern in JavaScript which is used to wrap something to change it's behavior.
In both JavaScript and TypeScript this is an experimental feature. In JavaScript, it's still a Stage 2 proposal and you can only use it via transpilers like Babel.
I've decided to explain TypeScript decorators because in TypeScript it has been standardized, and both are basically the same anyways.

Doppler helps you scale through this problem by providing an environment to store your secrets that you and your team can use. You will like to keep most of these environment variables within the team; hence, it’s not best to push it to a GitHub repository to avoid vulnerability. In this article, we will look through how to implement Doppler with a React-firebase app.
Doppler is a universal secret manager; this means that you can use doppler to manage secrets across applications within groups with less risk of vulnerability and ease of work.

An increasing number of folks tend to extract data from various sites for prospering their business.

Full-stack developers tend to implement features from beginning to end. They usually develop better concepts for applying and testing those features, given that they are 100% accountable for the production outcomes.
They are aware of the process of interaction of the components of the system and see the majority of the areas which have been impacted in the project that can break and require modifications. 
If something is not working, it will be their code, and they will be capable of debugging it without disturbing other folks. The product’s quality increases a lot thanks to this type of focus and commitment, and the number of glitches is minimized.

openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /home/user/Nvidia.key -outform DER -out /home/user/Nvidia.der -nodes -days 36500 -subj "/CN=Graphics Drivers"

First command will ask for a password. After reboot enter the same password. (** Prompt will ask for characters in specific position of the password. Do not enter the whole password. **)
sudo mokutil --import /home/user/Nvidia.der
sudo reboot

Check if keys are enrolled
sudo mokutil --list-enrolled # or sudo mokutil --list-enrolled | grep -i Graphics

Updated the /etc/dkms/sign_helper.sh. Add/update the line with the newly created key paths.
/lib/modules/"$1"/build/scripts/sign-file sha512 /home/user/Nvidia.priv /home/user/Nvidia.der "$2"
Update /etc/dkms/framework.conf Uncomment the line where sign_tool is mentioned
sign_tool="/etc/dkms/sign_helper.sh"
If you have already added dkms modules before changing the sign file, first remove and then add them again.
sudo dkms status # Check status of dkms module
sudo dkms remove <module>/<version> -k <kernel_version>
Eg. sudo dkms remove hid-asus-rog/1.0.2 -k 5.10.0-8-amd64
sudo dkms status # Check uninstalled again
sudo dkms add . # in the cloned directory of dkms module
sudo dkms build <module>/<version>
sudo dkms install <module>/<version>

For installing Nvidia driver using the .run file and enrolled keys. Get-the-Driver-here
sudo sh ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-460.73.01.run -s --module-signing-secret-key=/home/user/Nvidia.key --module-signing-public-key=/home/user/Nvidia.der

API stands for Application-Programming-Interface. It is the middle layer between User Interface and Backend Server. You can take API as an waiter in restaurant, where User requests are customers and Server is the Chef in the Kitchen. When customer has a specific request, it is taken to chef by waiter.

I am an avid user of ZEN for over 10 years now and it works for me.

But it seems that Intersystems are no longer actively developing it (or ZEN Mojo), the only published reference to this  is here
As an aside, Intersystems makes fine products (I have been using the technology for 35 years) and has great support BUT they are not good at being open with their product road map/retirement plans.  This is very embarrassing  to me when talking with my end user clients.


So I am looking at how to replace ZEN - this is not a short term project, at one client I have over 800 ZEN pages.

And it's such a shame as ZEN works and, most importantly, I and the team know how to make it "sing and dance".
I work in back office business apps so do not need some of the fancy stuff …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What Is OpenGL?


OpenGL is a Graphics rendering API which is operating system independent, window system independent and has high-quality color images composed of geometric and image primitives. OpenGL APIs can use following - 
GL


OpenGL API implementation (http://www.opengl.org)
GLU


OpenGL Utility
Glut


GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) – Glut is portable windowing API and it is not officially part of OpenGL.
OpenGL Utility Toolkit (http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/)
FLTK


FlashLight ToolKit (http://www.fltk.org/)
GLEW
Now lets see how to install OpenGL in Ubuntu.
Now because GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) depends upon OpenGL and a number of other related libraries, if we install GLUT then OpenGL will be automatically be installed.
First update the repository using the given command
$ sudo apt-get update

Run the following command to install OpenGL.
$ sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev

Now to test if OpenGL libraries are working fine on our Linux machine, we will create a C++ program and test it.
So create a following C++ Program.
#include <GL/glut.h>

void displayMe(void)
{
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
    glBegin(GL_POLYGON);
        glVertex3f(0.5, 0.0, 0.5);
        glVertex3f(0.5, 0.0, 0.0);
        glVertex3f(0.0, 0.5, 0.0);
        glVertex3f(0.0, 0.0, 0.5);
    glEnd();
    glFlush();
}

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    glutInit(&argc, argv);
    glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_SINGLE);
    glutInitWindowSize(400, 300);
    glutInitWindowPosition(100, 100);
    glutCreateWindow("Hello world!");
    glutDisplayFunc(displayMe);
    glutMainLoop();
    return 0;
}

Now give the command below to compile your code.
$ g++ main.cpp -o firstOpenGlApp -lglut -lGLU -lGL

Now run your OpenGl program with following command
$ ./firstOpenGlApp

You will see something like this on your screen if everythings went well.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Reader 👋
To update an object inside a nested array in MongoDB you can use this approach, Its well tested and working.
Update nested array objects. See below picture for a better Idea what we are going to do. We will update the object which is nested by 3 levels of array.
{
 discussionList[
  discussionList [
   {
     object-value-to-be-updated.
   }
  ]
 ]
} 


public courseCategoryPostCommentReplyUpdate(operation: CommentReplyUpdateMutation): Promise<IDocumentUpdateType> {
    return this.courseCategoryPostCommentsModel.updateOne(
      {
        "postId" : operation.postId,
        'discussionList': {
          '$elemMatch': {
            '_id': operation.commentId,
            "discussionList._id": operation.replyId
          }
        }
      },
      {
        $set: {
          "discussionList.$[outer].discussionList.$[inner].payload": operation.payload,
          "discussionList.$[outer].discussionList.$[inner].isUpdated": true,
          "discussionList.$[outer].discussionList.$[inner].commentUpdateTime": new Date()
        }
      },
      {
        arrayFilters: [
          { "outer._id": operation.commentId},
          {"inner._id": operation.replyId}

      ]
      }
    );
  }

FootNotes - this code is to update the reply of a comment.
That's how you can perform operations on an object in nested array in mongoDB document. You can also update/delete the objects which are having the more level of nesting by just modifying the query.
Please let me know if the code needs an explanation. Thanks 🙂]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever wanted to use React components in an Angular application ? Or to start migrating an Angular app to React component-by-component ? Or simply use both at the same time ?
I developped ngx-react which allows you to do just that with ease.
It enables you to use your Angular components in React, and vice versa, quite transparently, and without boilerplate.
Just declare a bridge, somewhere in your application:
import { NgxReactBridge } from 'ngx-react';

export const bridge = new NgxReactBridge()
    // bridge options:
    .addProvider(/** Add a global react provider here */);

Then, to use an Angular component in React, just import it like that:
const AsReact = bridge.toReact(MyAngularCommonent);

// use it 👉  <AsReact prop={whatever} />

The generated ⚛️ component will take as props all the @Input()s of your 🅰️ component, and all the @Output()s, mapped to functions. (i.e. @Output() onThing: EventEmitter<string> will be mapped to prop onThing: (event: string) => void.
To use a React component in Angular, you'll have to do a tiny bit more work... for instance if you have a React component:
function MyReactComponent(props: {
  data: string;
  dataChange: (evt: string) => void;
}) {
    // [...]
}


Then magically convert it to its Angular counterpart like that:
@Directive({ selector: "my-react-component" })
export class MyReactComponent_Angular extends reactBridge.toAngular(
  MyReactComponent
) {

  // a bit of extra work: You will have to map the properties yourself 
  @Input()
  data!: string;
  @Output()
  dataChange = new EventEmitter();
}

(the Angular compiler doesnt allow to build dynamic components... so we have to declare them statically)
Just inject Angular services in React like that:
const service = useService(MyAngularService);

I'll write more about this when I have more time 👉 But please share your thought if you have some :)

This article explains how to manage subscriptions in Angular components without repeating the same teardown logic in each component.
There are two common ways to manage RxJS subscriptions in Angular components to prevent memory leaks:
@Component({
  selector: 'interval',
  templateUrl: './interval.component.html',
})
export class IntervalComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  // initialize `Subscription` object
  private readonly subscriptions = new Subscription();

  ngOnInit(): void {
    // add all subscriptions to it
    this.subscriptions.add(
      interval(1000)
        .pipe(map(i => `== ${i} ==`))
        .subscribe(console.log)
