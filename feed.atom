The @angular-eslint repo includes a number of linting rules that can help enforce accessibility best practices within Angular component templates.
It is important to note, however, that these rules do not check attributes and roles set using the host section of the @Component decorator, or ones set using @HostBinding decorators.
While passing these rules isn't a guarantee or metric for ensuring full accessibility, it is a step in the right direction.

This article is intended for intermediate level website developers and software engineers. I've tried to make it approachable for beginners but it's really not for absolute beginners.
Website authentication can be a very confusing topic. There are a lot of considerations when thinking about an authentication system for your web projects.

Makefile
build:
    docker build . -t my-basic-app

Look. I have the most basic app, Dockerfile and Makefile. Why can't it just run make build command properly as I defined in Makefile?
shyamajp@ubuntu:~/Projects/my-basic-app$ make build
make: 'build' is up to date.

Let's get rid of this stupid error. At the root level, you must have a directory named build. That's why you see this unexpected behavior.
In my case, I can change outDir name from build to dist to avoid this specific conflict.
tsconfig.json
{
    "outDir": "dist"
}

Do not name your directory same as Makefile target. Be careful with names like build and test, which are often used for both Makefile targets and directory names.
I know this is a noob question but I've done it a few times already and I thought I might as well document it somewhere for myself. I hope this helps other newbie folks like me.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions to make this article better. Thank you for reading. Happy Coding!]]></summary>

Context switching is a form of multitasking requiring developers to switch between unrelated tasks. 
Frequent context switching reduces productivity, decreases energy and creativity, and negatively impacts quality of work. Minimizing context switching can help developers better focus on their highest priority tasks, avoid mental fatigue, and reduce the risk of burnout. 
The concept of context switching originated in computer science. When computers switch between tasks, they need to carry out several intermediary tasks to stop the previous task and begin the new task. Each switch costs time and energy:

This year there has been a big movement in build tools in the JavaScript community.

In 2020, Webpack, especially in combination with Babel, seemed to be the de facto standard for build tools.
However, in 2021, the popularity of a completely new development environment/build tool that does not include Webpack has skyrocketed.
Vite.
ESBuild that starts without build.
NPM Trend, you can see that Vite has overtaken the number of downloads of create-react-app since July.
The Next.js team has also responded by abandoning Babel and introducing SWC, an ultra-fast TypeScript compiler, in Next v12.
What does that mean for us React Developers?
The Vite default react-ts template lacked Jest and ESLint (Prettier integrated).
Jest comes pre-installed with React-Testing-Library, Hook-Testing-Library, MSW, and TypeScript support.
You can easily install and run Jest with the following commands, 
yarn
npx degit laststance/vite-react-ts-extended myapp
cd myapp
yarn install
yarn dev

npm
npx degit laststance/vite-react-ts-extended myapp
cd myapp
npm install
npm run dev

github: https://github.com/laststance/vite-react-ts-extended
so I would be happy if you could use it as a way to build a instant React+TypeScript development environment for new libraries or anything else! 💅]]></summary>

We are not going to look for winners or losers because decisions taken on the type systems in languages we are going to discuss didn't come from scratch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The most part of applications written in JS nowadays uses at least few calls of Promises API, some of them uses es5 syntax, others async/await. But sometimes incomplete understanding of this technology(as in any other) can lead to unpredictable behavior, which can confuse uses, and take hours for you to understand the cause of the problem.
Spending too much time in writing JS code, i've found interesting case with promises: promises have an API which can lead to incorrect interpreting of potential result.
This is mostly related to classic es5 promise realization, but, alas, also affects async/await promises realization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
A bit of background: I've been using Linux both on my desktops and servers since the early 2000s. I'll try to distill what I learned over those years into a simple and easy-to-follow guide, in a way that I would approach things if I had to start from scratch.
I'll try to make things friendly towards new users - you should be able to follow the guide even if you have very little (or even no) experience with Linux. 
We're going to start by going through the process of setting up a Linux VPS and then build upon that.
So, why even bother instead of going "serverless"?
Well, first, there's no such thing as serverless, there are only servers controlled by you and servers controlled by someone else. In the long term, trading-off that control tends to come at a huge price.
By learning to run things yourself, even if you do end up going "serverless" on some projects, you'll have a much better and deeper understanding of those trade-offs, limitations, pitfalls, and lock-ins.
Easy scaling promises, for the most part, are just that - promises. Even if they weren't, it's extremely unlikely that you'll really need them. A lot of people would be very surprised how much you can get from a single Linux box.
Considering what you get in return, running your own VPS is really cheap (you can get a nice KVM-based VPS for a few bucks a month). 
But having full freedom and control over your server is priceless. With serverless options, you'll always be severely limited in what you can do and what you can depend upon (and even that limited set of dependencies is subject to change at any time).
In the next post, we're going to make a few important decisions about our new server.
Note: This is part #1 of the Essential Guide to Linux Servers in-progress series. You can follow me here or on Twitter for updates.]]></summary>

The story began when I decided to switch from Angular to React as my favorite and go-to framework in June 2021. Previously, everything is fine. I googled normally when I have to do some troubleshooting or just want to search for information related to my project using React. Everything changed when I started to feel tired of googling the same thing each time I need that information or code snippet.

After creating the grocery list, you will be able to open the application either as a web application or as a native application to see when the items were purchased. You will also be able to mark the item as used. Finally, you will receive a notification when you open the app if you have a perishable item that has not been yet been used and was purchased more than 3 days ago.

En 2019,Sass introdujo un nuevo sistema de módulos, incluida una migración de @import a @use. Al cambiar a la sintaxis@use, podemos determinar más fácilmente qué CSS no se utiliza y reducir el tamaño de la salida CSS compilada. Esto hace que sea imposible extraer inadvertidamente dependencias transitivas. Cada módulo se incluye solo una vez, sin importar cuántas veces se carguen esos estilos.

A message broker is a computer program that allows software, systems, and services to communicate with each other and exchange data, taking incoming messages from applications and performing actions on them.
By using message brokers, producers and consumers can communicate with the broker using a standard protocol for communication, with the broker handling all the data's state management and tracking.
This means all consumer applications do not need to take on the responsibility of managing state, tracking, and the message delivery complexity of the message broker itself. Message brokers rely on a component called message queues that store messages until a consumer service can process them.

One of the most important security concerns for entities using AWS is securing their AWS accounts. Evidently, managing an AWS account with 5 users may be somewhat a walk in the park. However, as the usage of the account scales, and the number of users increases, managing account becomes trivial. Several policies must be put in place in order to organize access between different stakeholders. 
One of the most common security features is to enable Multi-Factor Authentication on the AWS account users.
In this tutorial, we are going to setup a process that forbids any AWS user from using any service without:
Setting up an MFA device.
Signing in using MFA. Any user that signs in without MFA must not be allowed to manage any resource on AWS.

The whole software supply chain is a target for attackers and it is really important to make sure that we put all our effort into securing each link because if one fails, everything will be affected.
Supply chain activities include each step of the transformation of raw materials, components, and resources into a completed product, and its delivery to the end customer.
Each step could be a complex process itself and cause a security incident.
The software supply chain is similar to other activities or industries. Some resources are consumed, then transformed, through a series of steps and processes, and finally supplied as a product or service to a customer.

tmux is an open-source terminal multiplexer for Linux operating  distributions. It allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single window. 
on the other hand, ZSH, also called as 'Z Shell', is an extended version of the Bourne Shell (sh), with plenty of new features, and support for plugins and themes. Since it’s based on the same shell as Bash, ZSH has many of the same features, and switching over is a breeze.
If your editor for developing and coding is vim or sth like that, the best solution for you is tmux because you can always switch between tabs in a breeze and edit the code at the same time.
But if you are like me and use VSCode as code editor, I recommend you to install zsh and even OhMyZsh to have some great features like: auto suggestion(Not recommended), syntax highlighting and etc.
So, both of them are great and offer you some helpful features. zsh is more like a handful featured terminal and tmux will bring your editor and terminal at same place to switch simultaneously!
you can use both of them or install zash on tmux!]]></summary>

Limitar o acesso aos metadados de uma instância faz parte de uma estratégia de segurança em camadas, que tem como objetivo impedir o acesso aos metadados por usuários/aplicações não autorizadas. 
Essa ação soma-se à utilização do IMDSv2.
Podemos utilizar regras de iptables para limitar o acesso, permitindo acesso a usuários ou grupos específicos.
O exemplo a seguir libera o acesso ao serviço de metadados da instância por todos os processos em execução na conta do usuário "app".
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 --proto tcp --destination 169.254.169.254 --match owner --uid-owner app--jump ACCEPT

O exemplo a seguir impede o acesso ao serviço de metadados da instância por todos os processos, exceto os processos em execução na conta do usuário root.
sudo iptables --append OUTPUT --proto tcp --destination 169.254.169.254 --match owner ! --uid-owner root --jump REJECT

Quite a few people replied with their pros and cons for both options. In this post I’m going to try and summarize the points mentioned there. I think that’s quite valuable to have as a reference in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SSH config ช่วยให้เรา config option ของแต่ละ host เอาไว้หลายๆอันได้ ทำให้ตอนเรียก ssh ใส่แค่ชื่อ hostname ใน config ก็พอแล้ว
เวลาใช้ ssh เพื่อ remote เครื่องอื่น ปกติแล้วจะสั่งประมาณนี้
ssh user@hostname

หรือถ้ามี port ที่ต่างจาก ssh ปกติ (22) ก็ใส่ option สำหรับ port เพิ่มคือ
ssh -p 2222 user@hostname

หรือถ้ามี IdentityFile ด้วย ก็ต้องเพิ่ม option ไปอีกแบบนี้
ssh -i identity.key -p 2222 user@hostname

ตัวอย่างเช่นผมจะ ssh เข้า Ubuntu ที่ลงไว้ใน Virtual Box โดยใช้ vagrant ปกติแล้วจะสั่ง vagrant ssh ก็ได้ แต่ถ้าจะสั่งด้วย ssh เองโดยตรงจะต้องสั่งประมาณนี้
ssh -i ~/vagrants/ubuntu/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key -p 2222 vagrant@127.0.0.1

ทีนี้ถ้าเราจะใช้ SSH config ช่วยเราก็สร้างไฟล์ config ที่ $HOME/.ssh/config
จากนั้นกำหนดค่าแบบนี้
Host ubuntu-vagrant
  HostName 127.0.0.1
  IdentityFile ~/vagrants/ubuntu/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
  Port 2222
  User vagrant

ลักษณะ config file ของ SSH ก็มี key เช่น Host, HostName, IdentityFile, Port และ User แล้วเว้นวรรคด้วย 1 ช่องว่าง ตามด้วยค่าที่กำหนดให้ key นั้นๆ 
แล้วก็มีการใช้ indentation เพื่อบอกว่าค่านั้นเป็น key/value ย่อยๆของ key หลักอีกที
จากตัวอย่างผมกำหนด Host คือ ubuntu-vagrant แล้วก็กำหนดค่า HostName เป็น IP หรือ Domain name ของ Host ที่เราต้องการต่อ แล้วก็ค่า IdentityFile ไปที่ path ของ private key ของ vagrant ที่กำหนดให้กับ VM ที่ต้องการ remote ตามด้วยค่า Port 2222 แล้วก็​ User คือ username ในทีนี้คือ vagrant
เสร็จแล้วหลังจากนั้นเวลาเราต้องการ connect ไปที่ Ubuntu ใน VM ก็แค่สั่ง
ssh ubuntu-vagrant

เท่านี้ก็ได้แล้ว]]></summary>

To start off, a reference to a starwars quote: 'This is not the free memory you're looking for'. 
What this quote means to say is that whilst the free memory statistic obviously shows free memory, what you are actually looking for is the amount of memory that can be used for memory allocations on the system. On linux, this is not the same as free memory.
Of course free memory is directly available, actually free memory, which can be directly used by a process that needs free memory (a free page). A free page is produced by the kernel page daemon (commonly named 'swapper'),…]]></summary>

Provavelmente você já deve ter ouvido sobre "processos" enquanto estava mexendo em seu computador. A maioria de nós talvez só nos damos conta da existência deles em "momentos ruins", por exemplo, quando alguma aplicação está travada e temos que "finalizar o processo dela". Contudo, fora o conhecimento em saber como finalizar o "bendito" para você continuar exercendo suas atividades, algo importantíssimo também é entender qual é a real importância de um processo.
Quando estamos trabalhando em um ambiente multiprogramado/multitarefa, o Sistema Operacional (SO) é responsável por gerenciar diversos programas executados "concorrentemente", controlando o compartilhamento dos recursos para cada um deles.
