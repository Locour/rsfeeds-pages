        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[console.log is useful in a lot of situations (although there are usually better ways to debug if that's what you're doing).
In the browser console.log works well with objects, you can drill down as much as you need. But in Node.js, when you look at the output of a nested object, you'll often see this:
$ console.log({a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}})

{ a: { b: { c: [Object] } } }

d: {} was replaced with [Object]. But why?
It's because the command line / terminal doesn't have a nice UI for drilling down, so Node attempts to print up to three levels deep. Beyond three levels it just prints [Object].
This is controlled by a variable in the node 'util' module, called depth, which defaults to 2. You can set it yourself here:
require('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = 0; // top level only, e.g.:
// { a: [Object] }
require('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = null; // print everything, e.g.: 
// {
//  a: { b: { c: { d: {} } } }
// }

It's not a great idea to change an underlying variable, as it might come back to bite later. So a cleaner way is to convert the JSON object to a string and log that. We can use node's built in JSON class and the stringify method:
complexObject = {a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}}
console.log(JSON.stringify(complexObject, null, 2))

// {
//   "a": {
//     "b": {
//       "c": {
//         "d": {}
//       }
//     }
//   }
// }

Note that the 3rd parameter of JSON.stringify, Number 2, controls the number of spaces of indentation, and the 2nd parameter can be used to filter or adjust the objects and properties shown.
Now you can really see what's in those deep Objects.]]></summary>

As one of the biggest code hosting platforms available today, GitHub provides numerous ways for developers to integrate with the platform. One of those integration options is GitHub webhooks.
In this article, we are going to explore GitHub webhooks. We will look at what a GitHub webhook is, and how to set it up on our GitHub account. Further, we will explore a sample API that receives and logs webhook events. This API will run on our local development environment, thus we will be receiving the webhooks on our local machine. However, if you have a local API you would rather use, feel free to follow along with the article.

Event processing is one of the common implementations when building TypeScript applications.
Registering an event as well as executing some actions when an event has been triggered requires an Observable pattern, which provides a unidirectional flow to streams of events, making debugging and error handling with event streams a lot easier.
In this article, we will explore Observables, how they are used to handle event-driven data, and errors and asynchronous data.
 Introduction to Observables
 Observable operators
 Transforming arrays with Observable
 Combining multiple operators for event stream transformation

Anyway, many of these services come with some limitations or have costs that explode with resource usage. That’s why a lot of developers still prefer solutions like Kubernetes for keeping control over the application and having full freedom for implementation. Anyway, Kubernetes governance is expensive and we aim to reduce the friction near the application development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
I am currently building a project in nodejs with an angular application as a frontend. I need to send data from my website to the server (POST reqeust) which then emtis data to one of many raspberry PIs and gives feedback to my angular app per websocket connection.
I have a few questions on how to do this whole process:
I have an index.js file where I load all my express middleware etc, and some router files for specific routes. The websocket connection should be initialised outside the router so I dont open a new one every time. Should I create an on connection listener in the index.js file and outsource all the emits to a different file, or should the whole socket server live inside a different file?


I know that socketio needs an http server to work, but I cannot pass an exress server in its constructor. Should I use an http server for my server instead and use express as a request handler? Or should I create a new http server for my websocket connection?


Should I create a different socket server for the server/angular and raspberry/server communication (I will need to store the socketID and token/id of the raspberry in a map to know which raspberry I should send the data to) or should I use the same server with different rooms?



I apologise if those questions are too basic, I have never really worked with websockets so I dont know about the best practices when working with them. I want to do everything as clean as possible.]]></summary>

O Vue 2.x tem um escopo que dependendo da forma que utilizar o TS dentro do projeto o próprio Typescript (que é um superset de Javascipt) tem dificuldade de interpretar/fazer leitura dessas props dentro das funções.

Yeah, with some caveats. But before I disclose those, you probably think that I'm insane for even presenting the idea that you can run VS Code on Android. And you're wrong, sorta.
VS Code is targeted at desktop operating systems, such as Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux distributions. There aren't explicit "Android" (much less mobile) versions of VS Code. So we can't just install it via the Google Play Store or a 3rd party app store like any other app. Rather, we have to run it in a Linux container.
I won't go into the details of creating a Linux container in this post, but you can check out my Guide to replacing a laptop with Android: Part 2 article for information on how to do that.

This post covers how idempotency keys are used in Medusa and how you can implement your own idempotency key logic in a NodeJS application to make your API more robust. This post and the implementation discussed here are inspired by this article by Brandur.
Idempotence is a mathematical term used to describe algebraic expressions that remain invariant when raised to a natural power - the word itself comes from the Latin words idem and potence meaning same and power respectively. In software and tech idempotency typically refers to the idea that you can perform an operation multiple times without triggering any side effects more than once. This is an extremely powerful property for fault tolerance in larger systems where service availability cannot be guaranteed. If you are fa…]]></summary>

October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month. On top of that, OWASP just celebrated its 20th anniversary. To celebrate, we’re going to run through the newly updated OWASP TOP 10 to remind everyone of how you can better protect your applications, your businesses, and your customers from unlawful and damaging cyber attacks. We’ll also be highlighting where the updates were made and why and throw in some tips on how strengthening your identity solution can help mitigate these threats.
The new Top 10 is still a working draft, and OWASP is soliciting feedback on errors and corrections.
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organization that was set up to help raise awareness around web application security and provides guidance on how to incorporate preventative measures into your applications, infrastructure, and internal processes.  
They have several projects, including an insecure JavaScript application used for security training, but the one that we’re focusing on today is the newly updated 2021 edition of their list of the top 10 threats to web app security.  
Updated regularly, the OWASP Top 10 lists the main security threats that affect web applications today. Each entry enumerates the threat, shows possible attack vectors, and highlights preventive measures to reduce the risk of such threat. At Auth0, we take steps to mitigate most of the issues outlined below, so when you delegate your authentication needs to us, a lot of this is already taken care of for you.
Let’s run through the list, looking at the threats and what we could be doing to make sure our own applications are secure and examining some features of the Auth0 platform that help to mitigate or entirely remove such threats.

Mobile apps are handy, but it is hard to fit in reports and other salient features into them. I an era when the usage of mobile phones is higher than web apps, business owners still prefer web apps over mobile apps to work smoothly.
Web Application Development
Web app development is the creation of app programs that reside in remote servers. They are delivered to the users with the help of the internet. Most of the web apps are written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Web app development comprises of front-end and back-end.
Importance of NodeJS Developers in Real-time Web App Development:
NodeJS developers are the ones who have the potency to develop large scale web apps with scalability and high-performance. It should be noted that real-time apps need two-way connections. NodeJS is the solution that helps business owners to develop real-time web apps with ease.

Imagine if Amazon were unavailable for just one day each year. At that rate, they would have 99.7% availability, which seems fairly reasonable on the surface. In 2020, however, Amazon's revenue was nearly $400 billion. Living with 99.7% availability instead of 100% would cost Amazon more than $1 billion. Downtime—even just a little—will cost your business.
We minimize downtime through redundancy. Building reliable systems out of unreliable components requires having spare components to replace the faulty ones. Still, though, it takes time to replace faulty components.
Now, let's take it to the realm of software. You have an enterprise-grade system with tens of thousands (or more) of servers and applications. Those are spread across the globe. You need to deploy your applications…]]></summary>

So, I made a python script that connects to a Chromecast and plays video & audio (.mp4 || .mp3) as soon as you drop your file in the chromecast folder...
The idea came when I was looking for a quick way to share files onto my TV or Google Home Max without having to need a dedicated app. So, I hacked the b*tch!
On a serious note...
 
 
A. Know the "friendly" name of your TV (CASDROP_TV_NAME) and Speaker (CASDROP_SPKR_NAME). 
B. Make sure your machine is running python ~> 3.9.7 (not mandatory, but you need at least python 3).
C. Install all dependencies to run this program: pip install requirements.txt
 
 
Step1. Open a new terminal on your unix/linux based computer 
NOTE: I ran these commands in a BASH environment, so I suggest doing the same...
 
Step2. Open params.sh and edit the <> with your own values. I ran into a few mistakes because I was putting in the wrong IP address.
 
Step3. Run the following command in your terminal:
ONLY RUN THIS ONCE!
bash params.sh #you may need to run this command with elevated privileges
 
Step4. Run the app:
1. Start a simple HTTP server:
    `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

2. Run the casting service: 
    `python3 casdrop.py`

3. Drop a file in your watch `CASDROP_WATCH_FOLDER` folder. Which in this case should be the folder we are looking to drop our files.

 


**At this point, your uploaded files should start streaming on the device(s).**

 
 
CASDROP_WATCH_FOLDER => A folder you drop files in, to cast to device(s)


CASDROP_SERVER_URL => The IP address you get from SimpleHTTPServer a.k.a (http://<ip_address>)


CASDROP_SPKR_NAME and CASDROP_TV_NAME=> Displayed name of devices with (Ussually shown in cast menu on YouTube or Spotify mobile app)




  
  
  Here's my sample param.sh file

Currently you can drop a .mp3 or .mp4 which will cast with zero problem. However, I plan on adding more features down

const even = (a: number) => {
  if (a % 2 === 0) {
    return a
  }
  throw new Error(`value: ${a} is even`);
}

as you can see if the value is even we return the number else we throw an error. The normal way of handling this would be to wrap it inside a try-catch and handle the error. But when you have multiple functions this becomes tedious and error-prone.
In the fp world instead of throwing errors all over the place, we convert them to data. This in typescript would look something like this:
type Try<A> = Success<A> | Failure

where Success is a container that wraps some value of type A and Failure is the alternative one that contains the error.
Let’s try to implement this structure! We will use a mix of OOP and FP, to create nicely chain…]]></summary>

Auth0 brings you the new ASP.NET Core Authentication SDK, which improves your development experience and better integrates with Auth0 features! Let's take a tour through the main features of the SDK to see how easy it becomes to integrate your ASP.NET applications with Auth0.
So far, you were used to relying on the standard Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect package to integrate your ASP.NET application with Auth0. That library does its job very well. However, when you move away from implementing the simple login and logout, your code starts becoming verbose until it gets messy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the rule of calling hooks:
Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns.
For the usage in HOC like below taken from https://github.com/launchdarkly/react-client-sdk/blob/e2f79f1c156e5e82f70cd88fd2bf22dc3be8ecad/src/withLDConsumer.tsx#L43:
function withLDConsumer(options: ConsumerOptions = { clientOnly: false }) {
  return function withLDConsumerHoc<P>(WrappedComponent: React.ComponentType<P & LDProps>) {
    return (props: P) => (
      <Consumer>
        {({ flags, ldClient }: LDContext) => {
          if (options.clientOnly) {
            return <WrappedComponent ldClient={ldClient} {...props} />;
          }

          return <WrappedComponent flags={flags} ldClient={ldClient} {...props} />;
        }}
      </Consumer>
    );
  };
}


Can I use hooks in the returned anonymous function, like below?
function withLDConsumer(options: ConsumerOptions = { clientOnly: false }) {
  return function withLDConsumerHoc<P>(WrappedComponent: React.ComponentType<P & LDProps>) {
    return (props: P) => (
      const [name, setName] = useState('Mary'); 
      <Consumer>
        {({ flags, ldClient }: LDContext) => {
          if (options.clientOnly) {
            return <WrappedComponent ldClient={ldClient} {...props} />;
          }

          return <WrappedComponent flags={flags} ldClient={ldClient} {...props} />;
        }}
      </Consumer>
    );
  };
}

I think it is a "always use Hooks at the top level of your React function", but my friend said it is a "nested function". My understanding to this is that this "nest" should only count from the function component level.]]></summary>

In this article, we’ll talk about this relationship using a specific example. On one side, there’s Bax Shop, a website selling and renting musical equipment. On the other, there’s Price2Spy – an advanced web crawler, looking to monitor prices on Bax Shop.
We’ll start off by talking about how Bax Shop came to be and give you a glimpse into its roots. Then we’ll focus on the period when they first launched their online store and how initially they fought bots on their website. Afterward, we’ll go over other methods they employed and also cover how Price2Spy adapted to these defenses, in this back-and-forth game of price monitoring.

Mehrzahl is a little npm module to format parts of a template string in singular or plural. Here is the npm page and this is how it works:
import { mz } from "mehrzahl"
const str = mz(3)`There {is|are} $value bird{|s} at the park.`
// str = "There are 3 birds at the park."

The issue I worked on was to add a reverse usage of the mz utility (and calling it zm) to accomplish this:
import { zm } from "mehrzahl"
const template = zm`There {was|were} $value bird{|s} at the park.`
template(5) // There were 5 birds at the park.
template(1) // There was 1 bird at the park.

Of course some languages will have some well known general guidelines, PEP-8 for Python, while other languages will have some general guidelines which are not set in stone but usually produce good practical results. 
For example, with TypeScript:
Classes, and Interfaces/Types must be in PascalCase;
Exported strings/constants should be in UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE;
Methods and functions should be in camelCase();
And so on...

Build a custom Angular Material theme and use the components as they are described in the documentation.
Build a custom Angular Material theme and build your own component library on top of Angular Material by wrapping their components in your own components.

A. You know your TV (CASDROP_TV_NAME) and Speaker (CASDROP_SPKR_NAME) name. 
B. Your machine is running python ~> 3.9.7 (not mandatory, but you need at least python 3).
C. Install all dependencies to run this program: pip install requirements.txt
 
 
Step1. Open a new terminal on your unix/linux based computer 
NOTE: make sure you're running in a BASH environment
 
Step2. Open params.sh and edit the <> with your own values
 
Step3. Run the following command in your terminal:
ONLY RUN THIS ONCE!
`bash params.sh #you may need to run this command with elevated privileges`

 
Step4. Do the following:
1. Start a simple HTTP server:
    `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

2. Start the casting service: 
    `python3 casdrop.py`

3. Drop a file in your watch `CASDROP_WATCH_FOLDER` folder

**At this point, depending on which file (.mp4 || .mp3) you uploaded it should start streaming on the device.**

 
 
CASDROP_WATCH_FOLDER => A folder you drop files in, to cast to device(s)


CASDROP_SERVER_URL => The IP address you get from SimpleHTTPServer a.k.a (http://<ip_address>)


CASDROP_SPKR_NAME and CASDROP_TV_NAME=> Displayed name of devices with (Ussually shown in cast menu on YouTube or Spotify mobile app)




  
  
  Here's my sample param.sh file

Effects are a powerful model for handling side effects in your application. Commonly this means when you are making a HTTP request in a NgRx powered application you will use an effect to handle the communication with the service but they can do so much more than that. And frankly this is what I usually used them for until I read https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/start-using-ngrx-effects-for-this#handling-the-flow-of-a-angular-material-dialog . 
I became intrigued by the idea of offloading some component material dialog code into the effect and started viewing the life cycle as a series of events and using the effect to talk to other effects. This can keep components more simple and pure where they use selectors to read data and dispatch actions in response to…]]></summary>

When it comes to security. There is a lot of guidance and also advice and commentary on why you should or should not use each approach. It's hard to understand all the different options and security issues they have.
You also have different clients (mobile/web/app) and each has different security requirements for managing, storing and processing data in the form of tokens, cookies or sessions.
At the end, your app may scale and not all options can be deployed as multiple instance nodes without additional changes to the app and infrastructure.
This means that you really need to make decisions at the beginning and ask questions like: What are your customers? and What are your requirements? and What can be added to the system in the future? and How is it poss…]]></summary>

This is significantly easier than I expected. Going pack to the zeroth post in this series, I am shocked at how far the community has pushed Android OS to become a desktop replacement OS.
Some of this work was undertaken by corporations. This is most clearly shown by Samsung Dex, a desktop skin of Android that is installed on most of Samsung's latest devices. It is still Android under the hood, and it isn't perfect either, but it provides a basic, Chromebook-Esque interface to Android. This software package is partly the reason why I chose the Samsung Galaxy S7 Tab as well.
The two apps to start developing in a Linux container on Android OS are:

It depends on who you ask. To me, it is simply:
Audio and video editing
Document processing
Password managers
Web browsers
Video games
Conference software
Development software
Some might add 3d modeling tools, content streaming tools, or maybe torrenting utilities to this list. But for my day-to-day use on a computer, I interact with these software packages the most.
For this tutorial, I won't be covering Development software as I will get more involved in setting up and configuring these software packages on Android in a later tutorial. But I will briefly go over a few repositories that contain useful tools that I intend to use.
I also won't be going over the specific tools that I intend to use for everything but development. Everyone has their favorite document processor or PDF reader, no point in trying to convince you otherwise.
Have the Google Play Store installed on your device.
Search for any of the keywords listed above in the Google Play Store search bar.
Profit.
And that's it. That is the end of part 1 of this roadmap, which again was to install the "vanilla" software of Android. In the next tutorial, I will go over the development setup that I have done.
But if you want to jump the gun on what software I intend to use, checkout Termux on F-Droid.
Termux is the killer app that allows for desktop-class development to happen on Android OS.

Lets talk about Images they are pretty cool right? Imagers are everywhere including in Articles and Emails.
![alt text](https://yoursite.com/some_image)

Or in HTML you'd use the image tag
<img src="https://yoursite.com/some_image" alt="alt text" />

and of course the markdown above is later compiled to HTML So lets focus on that.
So when a webpage have an image the browser will send an http request to the URL which is in the src of the image(https://yoursite.com/some_image in our case).
https://yoursite.com will send us and image which will be later shown to us in browser.
https://yoursite.com/ could look something like this
app.get("/some_image", (req, res) => {
     res.sendFile('some_image.jpg')
})

But the question is, is it that all we can do? Well its our code we can do whatever we want. So why not just notify our self that someone viewed this image?
app.get("/some_image", (req, res) => {
     notifyUser() //You can implement it the way you want
     res.sendFile('some_image.jpg')
})

Now we will be notified whenever a user sees our image. That also means that if we use this image in our article/email we will know when a user opens it/reads it.
So if you're seeing this image that means ...]]></summary>

I've summarized key takeaways from Ben Lesh’s talk from RxJS Live Asia and his slides below. Lesh is a member of the RxJS core team and formerly worked at Google on the Angular team.
