I want to talk to you about observability, the art of understanding errors and performance of your technology stack by implementing monitoring and some kind of tool to view that monitoring.
Listen, if you're making money as an engineer in the tech industry, you're doing a good job. Functional? Object-oriented? Microservices? One big scary monolith? 
If what you do is paying for groceries and keeping a roof over your head then it's good code, good architecture, and you have nothing to apologize for.

if this thing pays the bills it's good technology
So when I say 'I can't believe you're not doing observability' it's not about whether your technology is good in any absolute, Manichean sense. I completely understand how observability can seem like a reach goal, a ni…]]></summary>

What did we do so far? We enabled tracing on API and Lambda and we enabled enhanced monitoring for Lambda as well. We should do one more thing in order to start collecting information in proper way
By default logs for API Gateway are disabled.
In API service navigate to your API, then Stages, Prod (if you created the resource from the template), select Logs/Tracing tab (yes, you were here before). For the test enable all three settings and change level to INFO.

Trigger your API multiple times to generate logs. After this you should see API logs in CloudWatch.

Ok, it is time to add it to our SAM template. But wait! It is not "just add". Unfortunately, we need to rewrite almost whole template.

There's a debate to be had about whether using JavaScript or TypeScript leads to better outcomes when building a project. The advent of using JSDoc annotations to type a JavaScript codebase introduces a new dynamic to this discussion.
In this guide, we'll investigate what that looks like and come to an (opinionated) conclusion.
If you'd talked to me in 2018, I would have solidly recommended using TypeScript and steering away from JavaScript.
The rationale is simple: I'm exceedingly convinced of the value that static typing provides in terms of productivity and avoiding bugs in production. I appreciate this can be a contentious issue, but that is my settled opinion on the subject. Other opinions are available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why should you use Typescript?


Simple. It solves your problem. Let's see.
Type checking: This is why typescript really exists. It adds type checking over javascript. It stops you to write stupid code.

Let's see an example:
const addNums = (a, b) =\u003e {
return a + b
}

a and b should be numbers. But you stupidly pass strings.
addNums('1', '2')

output:
'12'

We don't want this to happen. It was a stupid example. But if you are working on a bigger project, this kind of bug can happen easily. You waste hours and hours to fix the code.

This is where typescript rescues us with type checking.
const addNums = (a: number, b: number) =\u003e {
return a + b
}

Now if you pass string it will give you an error so that you can fix it.

This backend service implemented its own caching layer to provide a faster response time and also cut down on the number of times Salesforce needed to be called.

When I first heard about the event loop, the concept kind of made sense.
I knew that Node.js is single-threaded but also very fast at the same time. It's using the event loop to handle thousands of concurrent requests. How exactly it accomplished that though, was a mystery to me.
I also knew not to block the event loop in Node.js otherwise server performance would suffer.
Everyone warned against blocking the event loop!
I was able to write asynchronous code that worked. I could also modify async code written by others without introducing new bugs (most of the time). But honestly, there were many moments where I had no idea why my code worked. 🤷🏼‍♂️

The event loop was an abstract concept and I did…]]></summary>

  What is the confirmation box in Angular?


It is a simple popup that prevents unwanted actions, for example when the user clicks the delete button, the popup dialog should appear with the question: "Are you sure you want to delete item data?" and two buttons "Confirm" and "Decline". That is an enhanced level of security needed in almost every professional application. 
It is the ngx-awesome-popup an open-source library made for Angular. It provides highly scalable options and styles to adapt to any angular project. The best part is it's callable only from typescript so it can be used directly in services without HTML templates and it uses observables. 

npm i @costlydeveloper/ngx-awesome-popup



imports: [

    NgxAwesomePopupModule.forRoot(), 

    ConfirmBoxConfigModule.forRoot()

]



confirmBox() {

        const confirmBox = new ConfirmBoxInitializer();

        confirmBox.setTitle('Are you sure?');

        confirmBox.setMessage('Confirm to delete user: John Doe!');

        confirmBox.setButtonLabels('YES', 'NO');



        // Choose layout color type

        confirmBox.setConfig({

            LayoutType: DialogLayoutDisplay.DANGER // SUCCESS | INFO | NONE | DANGER | WARNING

        });



        // Simply open the popup and listen which button is clicked

        confirmBox.openConfirmBox$().subscribe(resp => {

            // do some action after user click on a button

            console.log('Clicked button response: ', resp);

        });

We're developing a large React Native app which relies heavily on native components already written in Java, C++, and Objective-C. This means that we needed to develop, build, and test many different platforms on complex developer environments and build tools, that change often with platform updates.
This became a burden for our teams, with knowledge spread across many developers, installation guides, readme files, and internal wiki pages. It became expected that installations would take several days, and even a minor change in a dependency version resulted in inconsistent builds with obscure error messages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When i first started approaching reactive programming and rxjs i struggled a little bit to understand how data flows throught observables, pipes, operators and so on. All i had to help me were marble diagrams, but they just helped increasing the headache.
I wanted to create something that could help beginners approaching rxjs, while helping more experienced developers debug complex pipes. 
rx-debugger is born! 
Getting started with rx-debugger is super easy. All you have to do is patching source observable and using operators exported by the library. 
Here is an example:
import { rxDebugger, map, toArray } from 'rx-debugger';
import { of } from 'rxjs';

rxDebugger(of(1, 2, 3))
  .pipe(
    map((item) => item * 2),
    toArray()
  )
  .subscribe();

Doing so, you will get following output nicely printed in the console:

By the way, rx-debugger supports way more options than just printing tables in the console. You can find all the options in the docs.
rx-debugger is open source and hosted on GitHub. While being fully functional, it is in early stages of development, and any help or feedback would be appreciated!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stream data is very common in Nodejs. There is a module called Stream which provides an API for implementing the stream interface. Streams make for quite a handy abstraction, and there's a lot you can do with them - as an example, let's take a look at stream.pipe(), the method used to take a readable stream and connect it to a writeable stream.
A very common use for stream.pipe() is file stream.
const fs = require("fs");
let readStream = fs.createReadStream("./myDataInput.txt");
let writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("./myDataOutput.txt");

readStream.pipe(writeStream);

Above is a simple example shows that we use pipe to transfer the data from the read stream to the write stream.
However there is a problem when using the standard source.pipe(destination). Source will not be destroyed if the destination emits close or an error. You are not able to provide a callback to tell when then pipe has finished.
To solve this problem, we can use pipeline which introduced in Nodejs 10.x or later version. If you are using Nodejs 8.x or earlier, you can use pump.
const { pipeline } = require('stream');
let readStream = fs.createReadStream("./myDataInput.txt");
let writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("./myDataOutput.txt");

pipeline(readStream, writeStream, error => {
   if (error) {
      console.error(error);
   } else {
      console.info("Pipeline Successful")
   }
});

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's spooky season! So in this post, we're going to explore how to avoid being haunted by content you thought you deleted — but actually didn't. 
If you're hosting a static website using AWS S3, one of the easiest ways to update your site is with the sync CLI command:
aws s3 sync <LocalPath> <S3Uri>

Whether you're running the command manually or as part of a CI/CD pipeline, it's important to note that, by default, it will only add content.
This means that even if you intended to remove a page from your site and removed all links to it, the page could still be accessed by navigating to it directly.

In order to delete non-existing content using this command, you'll have to use the --delete flag.
aws s3 sync <LocalPath> <S3Uri> --delete

Just be careful to only use the --delete flag when you actually want to delete content that isn't present in the source directory.
In general, it's a good idea to run S3 CLI commands with the --dryrun flag to show what actions would be performed without actually performing them.
aws s3 sync <LocalPath> <S3Uri> --delete --dryrun

To read more about this command and other available options, see the documentation.

First of all, it increases security and helps you ease out the management of encryption keys. But it's also a highly recommended pattern by PCI-DSS (Security Standard for Credit Card Processing) and results in much stronger data privacy and data protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). 
When we think of data there are 3 places we can think of encrypting data:
At Rest - On hardware storage devices like on a disk or in your devices 
In Transit - In moving data between different locations like server to server through API calls
In Use - While it's being used by a server (New concept and still being researched)

In this post we look at how to get started using vanilla-extract with SvelteKit.  Before we get going though, we should spend a moment looking at what vanilla-extract is and why you might want to use in a project or at least try it out.
vanilla-extract is a modern Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) preprocessor, which generates plain CSS stylesheets.  It is TypeScript friendly and leans on TypeScript to add some extra useful features.  You can create your style in TypeScript files which sit alongside your Svelte code and import the styles, adding them as classes to your components.  The way you use them is similar to CSS modules usage pattern.
We'll get a proper introduction shortly, but here's a sneak peak as a teaser.  Here we define some style in our index.c…]]></summary>

Authentication is a process of proving and recognizing user’s correct identity. Generally, it deals with an individual’s username, password, OTP verification, and some type of additional verifications.

Single-Factor Authentication (SFA)
Two-factor Authentication (2FA)
Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
Token Authentication
Certificate-based Authentication
Biometric Authentication
Single-Factor Authentication is a widely used form of authentication. An user’s identity can be verified using username and password or pass code or other simple codes.
Like SFA, 2FA also uses username and password with an additional verification code that will be available on their owned device (mobile). This is an extra layer of protection to confirm their identity. For example, by enabling two …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If we use OnPush change detection strategy, immutability is helpful to ensure change detection works expectedly. 
One of the way to enforce immutability is using Immutable.js. However, using Immutable.js is not really straightforward. It adds another layer instead of using JS object directly e.g
const apps = List([{ name: 'slack' }, { name: 'skype' }]);
apps.get(0); // { name: 'slack' }

const app = Map({ name: 'slack' });
map.get("name"); // 'slack'

// Using Record if we want to access property directly
const AppRecord = Record({
    name: ''
});

class App extends AppRecord {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }
}

const newApp = new App({ name: 'slack' });
newApp.name; // 'slack'

We have to use get when using List and Map. Using Record could solve the issue, but if we have a very large object, using Record will be hard to maintain because we need to create each record per object and it's nested object.
Other issue is about JS compatibility because it needs to use fromJS and toJS methods to convert from and to JS object. 
I'd say that I'm not a fan of that lib and it makes things more complicated. 
Other possible approach I'm thinking of: 
readonly + ESLint immutable


Since Angular using Typescript, let's use Readonly<T>, ReadonlyArray to enforce immutability. 
Also add this no-mutation ESLint rule as extra protection https://github.com/jonaskello/eslint-plugin-functional/blob/master/docs/rules/immutable-data.md
is there any better approach? 
Thank you]]></summary>

When a bash shell is started at login it's considered interactive and expects to be attached to a TTY. When we run curl https://example.com/script.sh | bash the bash process started is non-interactive and expects no human input. We can confirm a bash process' interactivity either by looking at the process table (run ps) or by checking the builtin variable $- (the shell's starting arguments) for an 'i' character.

The reason for this post. I started a site that is a network for developers to seek & give advice over video chat. 
https://p-pl.com is the site
For instance, if you are an expert in React.js, you can have other people connect with you. You as an expert can also bill for your time. (Hourly rate)
Or if you're seeking advice, you can search for and request to connect with other users that are online at that given moment. If they accept the call, you are immediately brought to the video chat portal to hash out your code issues or anything else.
Once the interaction ends, each user can rate eachother based on professionality, expertise etc. Think of it almost like an uber for information.
You as a user are ranked higher in the results based on your reviews as well as the meta data your provide in your profile.
This was a 2 1/2 year project and I just want it in the right hands. I will be posting tutorials later on how to use the site, core features etc.
What I'm looking to do is build the network full of JavaScript developers so that the community is rich with support in this language. Eventually then to move on to other languages.]]></summary>

I frequently end up with "login failed for token-identified-principal" after being connected for only a few minutes. This makes using Azure Data Studio an exercise in frustration, wondering what combination of operations will result in ADS just conking out on you until your token expires.
Azure SQL doesn't support the standard T-SQL BACKUP and RESTORE commands, so getting a copy of your database for local development is somewhat challenging. The Azure Portal requires the AAD admin credentials, not something I want to give out to developers. Enter SqlPackage, which I have started preferring to both the Azure portal and ADS. SqlPackage for Linux is available at https://aka.ms/sqlpackage-linux.
A first attempt at copying the database from Azure might look like this:
sqlpackage /a:export /scs:"Data Source=...Initial Catalog=..." /ua:true /tid:"mytenant.onmicrosoft.com"
Indeed, that's what I attempted. But UniversalAuthentication (required to authenticate with MFA) doesn't seem to work as expected on Linux. You would expect that a browser would be launched to login to the application (since MFA won't work without a browser). However, the command above doesn't work.
Looking through the SqlPackage help, I see that there is a /AccessToken option. We can manually obtain an access token and use it to authenticate. Access tokens can be obtained using the Azure CLI, using the command az account get-access token --resource https://database.windows.net/. This will return a JSON body containing (among other things) the access token to use. Copy and paste this into an environment variable ACCESS_TOKEN, and then the full sqlpackage invocation becomes:
sqlpackage /a:export /at:"$ACCESS_TOKEN" /scs:"Data Source=..." /ua:True ...]]></summary>

Let’s face it. We all make mistakes. Even the most diligent, well-intentioned employee can inadvertently open the floodgates to an attack. Telecoms giant Verizon illustrated this earlier this year, when it published the 2021 edition of its Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR).
The DBIR examined approximately 5,250 successful security breaches, gathering data about the methodologies used. It found 35 percent of attacks incorporated a social element. Of these, the vast majority (85%) used phishing tactics.
In short: you can deploy all the technological measures you want, but unless you address the human element, an attacker can defeat your defenses with a simple phone call or email.

These containers represent isolated environments that provide everything necessary to run the application. Dockerizing an application refers to packaging it in a Docker image to run in one or more containers.
Dockerizing an application involves specifying everything needed to run the application in a Dockerfile and then using the file to build a specialized Docker image that can be shared to multiple machines. A Docker image is a reproducible environment for the application that guarantees portability across machines.

I was doing a bit of bug-hunting in an old project of mine when I found an interesting bug. Can you find it?
If you know your security or PHP this might be quite easy for you. Otherwise, it might be a good exercise.
This is the request you would make to the server:
curl --location --request POST 'https://super.secure-api.com/check-pin' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
    --data-raw '{
      "pin": <you_answer>
    }'

And this is the code for that given endpoint (/check-pin)
if($params['pin'] != $user->getPin()) {
  throw new HttpException(403, "The pin is incorrect");
}

return "The pin is correct!";

PD: This is just a demo, not real code. You should never check passwords/pins/secrets like this.
pin to be able to bypass the check?


I will release a post in a couple of days explaining the bug in detail and how to fix it.]]></summary>

DEMO HERE

My first attempt was to use an interceptor service that contained a BehaviorSubject (Observable). I set it up to maintain a counter and set the observable's value to true if there were more than zero (0) requests in-flight.
Through heavy use of the console.log functionality, I came to realize that the interceptor was not always active, even though I was following proper singleton patterns.
The second attempt went more smoothly.
I had a second service (a handler) that maintained the counts and the BehaviorSubject. This one worked "like a charm."
