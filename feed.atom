        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Angular is a development platform for building WEB, mobile and desktop applications using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (JavaScript). Currently, Angular is at version 13 and Google is the main maintainer of the project.
Form validation enables the quality, accuracy, and integrity of the user input data. It’s possible to validate a form in Angular in two ways, one with reactive (using functions in the component class) and the other with template-driven forms (using attributes in the HTML) and we will use the template-driven forms way.
Before you start, you need to install and configure the tools:
git
Node.js and npm
Angular CLI
IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These are some rules that I have lazily picked up over the past four years of professional development on angular.
I generally work on small to medium projects without the time to integrate a formal state management system.
It is for this reason that there are data services that try to solve the problem of carrying communication around. If anyone has any further questions or curiosities regarding these points feel free to leave a comment.
methods must be extracted into functions until nothing can be extracted anymore
the component logic shold refer only to local resources of the component as much as possible
dataservices deal with data I/O with the server
the business Logic must live within the dataservice and all components should be of assistance to the business Logic, visualization assistance and small local logics to visualize and modify data
components (internal to the feature internal to the root component) must implement the root dataservice or receive data as input (observables are strongly preferred)
avoid multi-level handovers through inputs, it slows you down and makes refactoring a hassle
if the data as input changed hands more than twice use a dataservice,
each feature must have its own module and declare components related only to that feature
putting the general dataservice next to the feature module is the best way to indicate the root from which to start exploring the code
the beginning of the end of the data flow must take place within the dataservice

the substrate cache-services for API calls must live in the provide of the feature module they belong to and refer to
components  can be interaction contexts between dataservices but services are preferred when possible
interaction services can be interaction contexts between dataservices]]></summary>

You may have found this article for several reasons. Maybe you just landed a big promotion to CISO/CSO or you’re looking to become one soon. You could have been a CISO or security lead for a while now and are looking for new ideas. Whatever brought you here, you will come away with a game plan for strengthening your information security program.
First and foremost, a CISO is an advocate for good information security practices within the business. Stating it like that makes it sound simple, but there are so many responsibilities and considerations that go into a complete information security program. Security considerations go far beyond just technical controls. The many domains of cyber security could be listed along with key components of each, but it’s much easier to provi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Prometheus.yml:
# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.

scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'prometheus'

    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']

  - job_name: 'node-exporter'

    # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
    scrape_interval: 5s
    metrics_path: /metrics

    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - <PUBLIC IP>:9100

This is a good starting place for a monitoring system for Linux boxes
Running the services in docker is also advised as it simplifies the rollout.
Docker node exporter:
sudo docker run --restart always -d --net="host" --pid="host"  -v "/:/host:ro,rslave"  prom/node-exporter:latest  --path.rootfs=/host

Docker prometheus:
sudo docker service create --replicas 1 --name dockerprometheus     --mount type=bind,source=/home/ubuntu/prometheus/prometheus.yml,destination=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml     --publish published=9090,target=9090,protocol=tcp     prom/prometheus

When you get around to making panels in Grafana, these queries are very useful:
100 - ((node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/",fstype!="rootfs"} * 100) /            node_filesystem_size_bytes{mountpoint="/",fstype!="rootfs"})

node_filesystem_avail_bytes


OR you could just setup a template for Node Exporter:

Enter 405 for the Grafana ID.

Pick up the name and choose a Data Source for the dashboard.

To make an alert, start a NEW dashboard and NEW panel. Template dashboards like above will not work. 
Enter the query for the item you want to track and press the Alert tab.
That should do it for a basic monitoring service.]]></summary>

En este video vamos a ver que necesitas para crear tu juego que premie a los jugadores con tokens por jugar.





  
  
  Dependencias


Para este tutorial ocuparás NodeJs que recomiendo descargarlo en Linux via NVM , también necesitarás un URL de RPC te recomiendo usar INFURA, y finalmente Metamask con fondos de Rinkeby Testnet que puedes conseguir desde el Faucet.
Primero bajamos el proyecto Demo.
git clone https://github.com/FilosofiaCodigo/PlayToEarnDemo.git
cd PlayToEarnDemo/

Ahora instalamos las dependencias.
npm install

Antes de lanzar debemos agregar el archivo de configuración .env que puedes construir en base al arhivo de ejemplo .env.example.
Finalmente lanzamos.
npx truffle deploy --network rinkeby --reset

Primero ingresamos en la carpeta del backend e instalamos las dependencias.
cd backend
npm install

Luego crea un nuevo archivo .env pero esta vez en la carpeta /backend, este archivo contiene lo mismo que creamos en el paso 1.
También debes copypastear el archivo ./build/MyToken.json en ./backend/MyToken.json.
Finalmente edita acorde las variables CONTRACT_ADDRESS y BACKEND_WALLET_ADDRESS en ./backend/backend.js.
Ahora levantamos el servidor backend.
node backend.js

Para poder jugar en el frontend debemos lanzar la web del cliente. Para eso ingresamos en la carpeta del cliente e instalamos la única dependencia de manera global.
cd client
npm i -g lite-server

Igual como lo hicimos antes, debes copypastear el archivo ./build/MyToken.json esta vez en ./client/MyToken.json.
Una vez hecho esto lanzamos el juego.
lite-server

Recuerda agregar el contrato a metamask para observar cómo obtienes tokens por jugar.

In this blog post, you'll learn about what you need to break into the DevOps and SRE space.

GitHub Actions helps automate tasks within your software development life cycle. They are event-driven, meaning that you can run a series of commands after a specified event has occurred. For example, every time someone creates a pull request for a repository, you can automatically run a command that executes a software testing script. In fact you can create any sort of creative automation using GitHub Actions.
GitHub Actions consists of a few different components, let's take a look at some of these components in a bit more detail.

In this article, we will look at:
Introducing Node.js
The Node architecture
How Node.js works
Installing Node.js
Your first Node.js program
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on Chrome's V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
(Chrome's V8 Engine is a fast Javascript to the machine-code compiler to load, optimize and run Javascript code which is written in C++)
Node is single-threaded, based on event-driven architecture, and non-blocking based on the I/O model.
Why we use Node.js ?

vue create vuex-counter

and make sure you include Vuex, TypeScript and Use class components in your options.




Let's now create the Vuex store. The store will consist of a singular state which will contain the main count from where we'll derive the incremented and decremented ones.
src/store/index.ts
import Vue from "vue";
import Vuex from "vuex";

Vue.use(Vuex);

export default new Vuex.Store({

  Why Rust?



As a Front-End developer, there is a lot you need to learn and keep up to date. One of the biggest changes coming to web development is  web3.0, if you are not living under a rock you have probably heard about it,  at least a little. With these changes coming to the web I decided to learn rust to make myself more valuable, this decision also comes after researching the kind of projects you could do. One of them is a compiler, which funny enough my favorite React framework Next uses. I am a big fan of Next and my goal is to understand how rust  made a framework that was already fast even faster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, recently I ran into an issue where one of my functions was not being implemented "at the correct time." The solution was to trigger it in another component via ngOnInit.
Moving the code was simple, but in the process I ran into an issue that I've seen before but not dug into.
The issue is that I like to use fat-arrow functions in my code (() => {}) and somewhere along the way I converted an ngOnInit to fat-arrow. I unknowingly broke the OnInit lifecycle hook complete.
ngOnInit = async (): Promise<void> => {
  await this.init();
  ...
};

The fix was actually pretty simple, I converted the code back to a traditional function pattern ...
async ngOnInit(): Promise<void> {
  await this.init();
  ...
}

... and my function started working again.
Be careful (yes, I am telling myself this) as you may inadvertently write code that does not execute correctly. It was a simple mistake and one that was hidden by some layers of async behavior.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suppose you have the requirement that you want to show list of users if the url is /user, and you want to show user detail of a particular user when the URL is /user/useId.
To achieve this we can create a users component, then in its ngOnInit we could check if params are present.
/// Here route is ActivatedRoute

this.route.queryParams.subscribe(params => {

if(params.userId){
//// Do Something
console.log(params.userId);
}
});


You can get the params like this and then write your logic accordindly. If params are present then show userDetails if not then list of users.
Like So
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '/user', component: UsersComponent },
  { path: '/user:userId', component : UserDetailsComponent}
];

Here we are explicitly stating that if url is /user then show UsersComponent or if it is like /users/xxxid then show userDetials page.
This is more Systematic & preferred way of doing the task.
If you are using only one parameter then use parameterized route. But if you have many parameters then use querry Params as stated above in solution 1.
<a *ngFor="let user of users"
  routerLink="/user/{{user.id}}">
  {{user.name}}
</a>

Assume we are having list users and clicking on a user name will open that particlular user details.
To get the value of ther parameter use ActivatedRoute
console.log(this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('userId');

Points To remember
If you are getting any error remember to recheck the route you had written. sometimes you append extra / like user/:userId/ or prepend extra slash (/) like /user/:userId.
Although you can use more then two parameters
like  user/:userId/:id/:age 
I would suggest to avoid it and if it cannot be avoided atleast limit it to two parameters.]]></summary>

While it's the simplest and most effective way of specifying the model to use, we often don't want to show these IDs to the user. By displaying primary keys, you give users the ability to estimate the number of rows in your tables. If authorization isn't effective or routes aren't protected, users could input random numbers to access information that they otherwise shouldn't have.

The component is a key part of the Angular App structure. Everything in Angular comes around the state of the component and how it will be projected in the UI. On many occasions, we can use streams that will help us to represent volatile pieces of our data inside the view.

When using the Command Line Interface, we often find a few long and / or confusing commands. And this post intends to ease the pain of getting along with that.
When things start to get complicated, there are some things that can be done. In this post, we are talking about three of them:
Aliases
Functions
Comments
An alias is exactly what it means: a nickname. It is very useful when running commands that take too much arguments. For example:
alias lah=ls -ltrah

Now, when running the lah command, it will be exactly like running ls -ltrah.
A function is probably the best way to run a group of commands. When adding a if or a for statement, it gets even more interesting. Let's suppose we want to connect to a server which is still being provisioned or rebooted:

This post was full of personal preferences, and i'm writing this based on my experience as hybrid mobile (React Native) developer.
As a mobile developer we are expected to build the apps artifacts (.apk/.ipa). Here was my problem when dealing with build/archiving apps artifacts:
As the code base grew larger, so does the build time. My current project took almost 15 mins for android and 35 mins for iOS.
When we are building the artifacts we can't change branch or run our code in simulator. Thus, (i assume) we can't code the new feature or fixing the issues while waiting for our build.
Building artifacts take a lot of computer resources (at least for iOS).
Those was my biggest problem aside from being noob to setup local environment to build the artifacts 🥲.

The one on the official MUI's Github repo featuring Next.js with TypeScript (my framework of choice) didn't follow standard Next.js folder structure, as of this writing.
So I felt inclined to create one with the most basic features that I would use myself. The result is on my Github (link below).
Here's a screenshot of the About page:

It features a standard folder structure as generated by create-next-app and the leanest usable ESLint + Prettier configs for linting/formatting.

One thing i spotted when i started using Tech Twitter was people would post screenshots of there system specifications in terminals with pretty logos etc and i wanted to know how it was all done!...... its actually SUPER simple.
NeoFetch is a free, easy to install application which gathers system information and prints it to the terminal in a "pretty way". It pulls together all of your system information and strips out the crap and displays it in a way that doesnt hurt the brain....
Installing NeoFetch is as easy as typing the following two commands....
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dawidd0811/neofetch


and
sudo apt update && sudo apt install neofetch


this add the official NeoFetch PPA to your ubuntu installation and means you will always get the most up to date version.
after that simply type neofetch in your terminal and you will get a screenshot like below.

Another app you can use is screenfetch which does near enough the exact same thing!.
Install it with the following command:
sudo apt install screenfetch


and then just type screenfetch in your terminal to get your system specs like below.

Well thats going to do it today hope this quick blog post will be of interest and help you out. as a side note you can also get Screenfetch for MacOS.

I ran into a situation where I had to put certain metrics alert for a couple of mongodb instances. This was a challenge as I couldnot find direct resources for the setup we were trying to achieve. So this article will help you plugin multiple mongodb sources and visualise them on Grafana. 
The setup we are doing would require Docker installed on your system/server.
Go to your mongodb shell and create a user . This user will be used by mongodb exporter to export the metrices and forward them to Prometheus.

  {
    user: "mongodb_exporter",

Honestly, Typescript might introduce a little bit more learning curve, and maybe a little bit more on syntax, with a trade of shorter and verbose syntax. Of course, there are more to just shorter and verbose.

Let's start with something easier. The next cases will help us to understand the concept of infer. Ok, look at the piece of code:

TypeScript infers a type quite smoothly — it's a number. This fact allows developers to not write such types everywhere. TypeScript takes care of it. By the way, where will be another type in case of const usage. Try it by yourself. I'm waiting for your explanation in the comments. This is a small interactive with a reader)

In my case, I want to use Ubuntu 21.10 on my laptop, Acer Swift 5 - SF514-52T, but I can't because there's no sound coming out of the HDMI port. I have filed this issue here.
I also can't connect my Bluetooth headset, Sony WH-CH710N, at all. The headset paired successfully but it just won't connect. I believe that this could be solved using the method provided here but I didn't have a chance to try it yet.
In fact, I had tried to run Linux on this laptop since Ubuntu 19.04 came out but fail because the integrated mic didn't work at all. Fortunately, this issue is fixed on Ubuntu 21.10.
Nevertheless, the sound system on Linux is a mess...
Linux will not succeed in the desktop market unless it works on most laptops considering that laptops already sell nearly 3 times more than PCs.
Hey, Linux, see you again in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, KDE neon, or SteamOS 3.0!]]></summary>

We'll start from a simple Mojolicious::Lite app, created using mojo generate lite_app:
From there, we can install Typescript using Node. Since Typescript cannot bundle itself into a single file, we will also install Webpack:
npm install --save-dev typescript webpack webpack-cli ts-loader

After installation we can configure Typescript using its tsconfig.json file. We'll use the public directory for our output, since this directory is served by Mojolicious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I had to work with some automatically generated types whilst using GraphQL. This is a very extremely useful feature! However, it can be a little cumbersome to specifically reach different custom nested types from the requests without it being too verbose.
But, being a little creative with some native Typescript functions we can find a way to handle this exact use case!

Let’s take for example this generated type (For the sake of the example, this will be a fairly simple type with a nested subtype):
If we wanted to extract the type of the array without it getting too verbose we could use some conditional typing from Typescript.

The following type allows us to extract it:
It can be a little confusing at first glance but let’s break down every portion. First, we have our ArrayElement which is a generic receiving the array itself as T.
Here the infer keyword from typescript (which must be used with extends) to declaratively introduce a new generic type U based on the given array.
Now let’s assume that the TStuff type is an array and we want to extract a singular TStuff. We could then supply the type of TStuff[] to ArrayElement
type TNestedStuff = ArrayElement<TStuff[]>;

Looking at the result of the extracted type we can now use it however we wish or even assign it as its own type to make it less verbose!

Here is the code sandbox to play around with the type and the Typescript documentation :

If you have any other way to extract a type from an array let me know in the comments below!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have a requirement to create Live date or True time digital clock not exactly like above animation but at least show you running time live. For this you have to know basic Linux Command, Shell syntax & Manual of Date command.
So Let's Accomplished the Task ! (bold text are command).
If you want to create a delay in program we always use sleep Command an if you want to echo-back the command we always use $(date). But if you have requirement to remove a new-line in terminal we have -n option in echo. or If you have some other requirement to do operations like New-line, Backspace & Tabulation. Then we have a options called -e stand for Sequence and you have to pass a sequence Character in string
For Example :-
    echo -e "Hello\nWorld" = To add a New-line.
    echo -e "Hello\bWorld" = To Backspace a letter.
    echo -e "Hello\tWorld" = To add a Tabulation.

After know this syntax we are able to create live running time Clock. So let's begin .
echo $(date +%r) = It will give the output of this date command format.
echo -e "$(date +%r)\b\b\b\b\b\b" = It will backspace the output (if command not work use below one).
echo -n  -e "$(date +%r)\b\b\b\b\b\b" = It will backspace the output (Why we have to do this you will know in a minute).
echo -n  -e "$(date +%r)\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b" = It will backspace all the output of command.
echo -n  -e "$(date +%r)$(sleep 1)\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b" = It will add 1s delay in command.
Now we have to add this thing in Loop. So it will keep on running .
While :
    > do
    > echo -n  -e "`date +%r``sleep 1`\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b"
    > done

The container superblock contains a link to the element known as checkpoint. Such checkpoint refers to the preceding container superblock which stores the information on an older state of the file system.This way, several older states can be restored by analyzing the chain of the container superblock.
The structure of ApFS file system is that of a B-tree, where the root directory containing data is the leaves of such tree. All branch nodes only contain links to the following node until they reach the leaf nodes. This file system uses containers as storage cells, and such cells can contain multiple ApFS volumes.
