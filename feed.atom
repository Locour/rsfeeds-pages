üí° Unix-like operating systems such as Linux do not have an undelete command.
When we delete something with rm , it's gone.Linux assumes we're smart and we know what we're doing.

One of the big problem can cause wildcards. so be particularly with them.
For Example : if we want to delete just the JS files in directory we type:
rm *.js
* and the .js like so:
rm * .js
.js
There is many ways to avoid this problem, here is 2 useful tip: 
-i (interactive) option, which prompt the user for confirmation  ,before deleting an existing file.
rm i *.js
rm: remove regular empty file 'mk.js'?
2 - whenever we use wildcards with rm, test the wildcard first with ls. This will let we see the files that will be deleted. Then we can press the up arrow ‚òùÔ∏è to recall the command and replace ls with rm.]]></summary>

We use it in Angular all the time, from simple reactions to HTTP client responses to full-blown state management solutions. But sometimes, it is easy to miss some details and create a code that can break at the worst possible moment. 
Let‚Äôs start with an example right away.

We have an observable that emits numbers from 1 to 5, and if the number is 3, we throw an error.
We can see the following output.
next: 1
next: 2
error: some error

For this use-case, React Query offers the useMutation hook.
Generally speaking, mutations are functions that have a side effect. As an example, have a look at the push method of Arrays: It has the side effect of changing the array in place where you're pushing a value to:
const myArray = [1]
myArray.push(2)

console.log(myArray) // [1, 2]

The immutable counterpart would be concat, which can also add values to an array, but it will return a new Array instead of directly manipulating the Array you operate on:

There is an issue with developing locally, not just with Laravel, where developers who are building saas products aren't able to get a clean setup for SSL in the browser. This makes setting things up like PWAs or Google sign-in buttons impossible if the certificate isn't valid.
Given the power of Docker and Caddy, the dream is real. You can absolutely use this for non-Laravel Sail web applications as well.
The end result of implementing the code below should give you a couple of certificates (intermediate.crt, laravel.test.crt) that you can install to your local system.

O que podemos fazer √© atualizar o m√≠nimo necess√°rio (e rezar), normalmente s√≥ atualizar o que representa um problema de seguran√ßa.
Para nos ajudar podemos utilizar a flag --security na execu√ß√£o do yum.
Antes de come√ßarmos vamos olhar uma sa√≠da padr√£o de um yum update, repare na quantidade de pacotes que ser√£o instalados (10) e atualizados (96)

# yum -y install yum-plugin-security

2 - Voc√™ pode listar todas as atualiza√ß√µes de seguran√ßa dispon√≠veis com o seguinte comando:

But what if I say there is another language that is just as powerful as JavaScript and has way lesser bugs when compared to when you use JavaScript in your app.
That language is TypeScript.
What is TypeScript?
If you know JavaScript, it mustn't be a problem switching to TypeScript as it essentially has the same concepts as JavaScript except a few of TypeScript's own concepts.
So what are the advantages of using TypeScript?
Concepts similar to JavaScript


TypeScript is type-safe


It keeps JavaScript in check


Runs on multiple places


Type Inference


It is developed and maintained by Microsoft

TypeScript is widely used and loved by developers around the world. Here are some testimonials given by popular companies which is another indication that switching to TypeScript is worth it.
According to Slack, the switch to TypeScript made their life a lot easier in terms of bug-fixing and productivity. They also said Static Analysis which analyzes your code and tries to infer types and warns the developer in advance before the code even runs.


According to Airbnb, TypeScript prevented 38% of the bugs based on their analysis.



TypeScript lets developers be productive and safe at the same time.
In StackOverflow's developer survey in 2020, TypeScript was declared to be the 2nd most loved programming language

There's an example repository scaffolded with create-react-app which I've created for this post. Probably of most interest is the component FancyTitle which uses the default props pattern discussed in this blog post.
Now let's get into the details of the pattern.
When using TypeScript with React, it's easy enough to define optional props. With your props interface, you simply apply the optional parameter symbol ?:
interface IMyComponentRequiredProps {
  someRequiredProp: string;
  someOptionalProp?: string;
}

But what if we want default values for our optional props in the case when they are not specified? 
A rather elegant way to do it is to define two separate interfaces, one for the required props, and one for the optional props. For example, if our component is ‚Ä¶]]></summary>

After a quick search on Google, I decided to use InfluxDB as my Time-Series Database to record the power usage signal because it provides an easy-to-use and easy-to-configure dashboard feature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this artical we will learn How to send emails using Gmail and NodeJS
Nodemailer:
Sending emails is a common feature that is present in many applications. This feature is used to notify user about news, like a newsletter, about your product status when it‚Äôs facing to an issue, recovery password and so on.
Step 1: Installing the nodemailer.
Step 2: Connecting with the Gmail
// create reusable transporter object using the default SMTP transport
let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({ service: 'gmail', auth: { user: youremail@gmail.com, pass: youremail password, }, });
Step 3: Configure Gmail account to accept less secure apps
To enable it you need to go to https://myaccount.google.com/ and select your Google Account. Then go to Security in the left sidebar and search by ‚ÄúLess secure app access‚Äù.
step 4: Definitely sending emails.
transporter.sendMail({ from: '"Your Name" youremail@gmail.com', // sender address to: "receiverone@gmail.com, receivertwo@outlook.com", // list of receivers subject: "Medium @edigleyssonsilva ‚úî", // Subject line text: "There is a new article. It's about sending emails, check it out!", // plain text body html: "There is a new article. It's about sending emails, check it out!", // html body }) .then(info => { console.log({info}); }) .catch(console.error);
Note that in the createTransport we only pass an attribute called service where we define it asgmail and the auth with our credentials.
{ info: { accepted: [ 'receiver@gmail.com' ], rejected: [], envelopeTime: 871, messageTime: 651, messageSize: 747, response: '250 2.0.0 OK 1615152446 m6sm5222884qtx.3 - gsmtp', envelope: { from: 'fromemail@gmail.com', to: [Array] }, messageId: '95e9c9a0-9c20-fcda-1873-7f16aec2b293@gmail.com' } }]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to manage your Node.js version on Replit



First, go to Replit and create a REPL. Select BASH and NOT Node.js (We'll install it later). Funnily enough, at the time of writing, if you ran node -v, you would see v14.17.1 (which is an LTS version, and also considering we didn't install Node).
Select Shell (which is just beside Console)
Copy and paste the following code below into Shell. On Windows, it's Ctrl+Shift+V. You can change the 16 below to any version you desire.




  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash
  export NVM_DIR="/config/nvm"
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
  [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
  nvm install 16 
  nvm use 16

Wait for a while. You may choose to go to the toilet or grab a few bites in the meantime.
After the code below has finished running and installing Node.js, run node -v && npm -v. You should see an updated Node.js (v16.x.x) and NPM (v8.x.x at time of writing) version. 
Run the following to test:




 echo console.log(`Node version: ${process.versions.node}`) > test.js
 node test.js

You should now see an updated/different Node version, depending on which version you installed and used earlier on.
That's it! You can now install and use any Node.js version you wish!

Lazy Loading is the design pattern which delays the loading or initialization of objects or resources until they are required. This improves performance drastically. In the case of React, the reduced bundle size leads to faster initial load time, which is crucial these days with dwindling attention span.
Luckily for us, React makes implementing Lazy Loading very easy for developers. All you need to do is wrap dynamic import statement import() with React.lazy.
Let's consider we have a Counter.js file.

This is my first time participating Hacktoberfest and I wasn't really sure what to expect. It's very intimidating for me to see so many huge projects that I don't feel like I'm experienced enough to help with, and try to find something in them to help fix or add to. So I wanted to start with something maybe smaller and work my way up to a larger project I am interested in.
It felt a lot harder to find something simple than I expected it to be, there were a lot of cool projects that looked very complicated and I wasn't really sure how to solve their issues.

A software bug is an error in a computer program that causes it to produce unexpected results or to behave in a disruptive fashion.
Albeit a bug can be a very innocent flaw, a careless mistake the impact it can have can still be exponentially larger than an exploit due to a big logical error in a code base.
eg. a small rounding error in the calculation of an orbit of a satellite can cause major financial damages with many other implications like space pollution.
Hence, every developer should be aware of basic cybersecurity practices!

A linked list is a linear data structure that represents a collection of elements that we'll call nodes , where each node points to the next one or previous one, the first node in the linked list is the head and the last is the tail

In the linked list each node must be have the following properties:
The main properties of the linked list are:
Size: The number of nodes in the linked list 
Head: The first node
Tail: The last node
and the main operations of a linked list data structure are: 
insertAt: Inserts a node at the specific index.


removeAt: Removes the node at the specific index.


getAt: Retrieves the element at the specific index.


Clear: Empties the linked list


Reverse(in this case): Reverses the order of nodes in the linked list

Praticamente todos os navegadores mant√™m um cache da aplica√ß√£o no computador do cliente para conseguir carregar a aplica√ß√£o de forma mais r√°pida e com menor consumo de dados e isso √© excelente. Entretanto, um efeito colateral √© que as atualiza√ß√µes podem demorar para serem entregues para o cliente. Como consequ√™ncia, o cliente pode ficar horas ou dias com uma vers√£o com um bug que j√° foi corrigido.
Em sistemas internos de empresas, isso pode resultar em liga√ß√µes ou tickets constantes para a equipe de suporte t√©cnico, causando uma sobrecarga na equipe.

When you start working as an application security engineer, you'll expect to find straightforward tasks to do. But this is not the case because each company has its vision and strategies to handle data security, which can let us infer that every organization's security maturity may differ from one to another.
Viewing data breaches and cyber incidents all the time proves that no one out there has a mature cyber security program.
If you are already working in this field, I imagine that you sometimes feel that you're achieving nothing and you are more invisible inside the organization. The bigest challenge I see is how to increase your visibility and have more transparency with your manager and the rest of your co-workers.

The goal is to create an application that will implement CRUD operations in Node.js using the Express.js framework and SQLite database, using the MVC design pattern. It will be a simple To Do List Application in which the user can Create, Read, Update and Delete a task.
The application is available on the following link To Do Application, and the complete code is available on the GitHub repository.
Getting started
Template engine
Routes
Database
MVC architectural pattern
More setup
Create task
Delete and update task
Data validation
Conclusion
The first step is to create a new directory and initialize the project using a terminal.

Proactive Monitoring
Incident Response and Recovery
For example, that recovery can include activities such as handling acute malware or ransomware incidents. 
Remediation Activities 
For Example, using information obtained from log files and other sources, a SOC member can recommend a better network segmentation strategy or a better system patching regimen. Improving existing CyberSecurity is a major responsibility of a SOC. 
Compliance
Organisation secure themselves through conformity to a security policy, as well as external security standards, such as ISO 27001x, the NIST CyberSecurity Framework(CSF) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

In this blog we will learn about service instances creation in Angular.
What happens when we inject service in root of a lazy module, is the same instance used for multiple lazy modules.
What if we want to have a separate instance per module and per component ?
We will use the same code example as used in common chunks example. If you haven't gone through that blog do checkout to learn on why common chunks are created.
Let's begin then.
Let's start where we ended in the previous post. We have two lazy modules user and account and currently share the same toast module which is built in a separate chunk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On most of the company websites, you will find locations or contacts page that displays that company location in that country or state in a google map along with the company address.
This is a pretty common requirement even for food or hotel business-related websites.
So in this article, we will see how to add a google map with the preferred location on your website.
Create a new folder with the name google-map-location-demo and create an index.html file inside it. Now, type ! (exclamation mark) in the file and press tab, so the default HTML code will automatically be added by emmet.
If you're not aware of emmet and its useful shortcuts, check out my this article.

You can change the title tag content as per your choice.
For this demo, we will show the Eiffel tower's location on the map.
So follow the below steps.
Navigate to https://maps.google.com/ and search for Eiffel Tower in the search box
Now, click on the Share icon and select the Embed a map option
Click on the COPY HTML button to copy the iframe tag into your clipboard
Now, open the index.html file, and inside the body tag, add the copied content

Now, If you open the file in the browser, you will see the map displayed

That's it about this short tutorial.
Check out my recently published Mastering Redux course.
In this course, you will build 3 apps along with a food ordering app and you'll learn:
Basic and advanced Redux
How to manage the complex state of array and objects
How to use multiple reducers to manage complex redux state
How to debug Redux application
How to use Redux in React using react-redux library to make your app reactive.
How to use redux-thunk library to handle async API calls and much more
and then finally we'll build a complete food ordering app from scratch with stripe integration for accepting payments and deploy it to the production.

What are Operators?
Operators are pure functions. They take observable as input and return output as observable.
map‚Äì a transformation operator works similar to Array.prototype.map
switchMap‚Äì cancels the inner observable when outer observable emits a value
catchError‚Äì catches the error and passes to error handling function

RxJS is Reactive Extensions of JavaScript. It is a library to work with Observables which make developers life easier. RxJS provides various operators to work with in Angular. In this article we will discuss about RxJS Observable forkJoin operator, its definition, real world uses, error handling, is it deprecated etc.
What is RxJS forkJoin
Is it deprecated ?
I will explain what I mean!
Initially forkJoin was accepting object arguments as rest parameter. That is deprecated and no longer used.
Now they updated the operator and ask to provide array of observables instead of object arguments. As the line itself saying in above screenshot- @deprecated

The console.log() function is something most JS developers know, you can output anything to the console (for Node as well as the browser). I think a lot of developers do not know about console.time() though. Probably something you will use a lot less, but can be very useful.
