        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being a coder I have never limited myself to one language, one framework and I didn‚Äôt want to have a milion code editors each specialised in different thing so I have always used VSCode. Keeping the theme, the look and feel of the editor with power of an IDE one plugin away no matter which language I want to jump into is the key factor that guided my choice.
However, I have tried JetBrains‚Äô WebStorm before and just couldn‚Äôt get rid of one huge thing haunting me, the project-wide type checking.
In VSCode the typescript plugin works great but it only checks files that are currently opened in the editor! Other files inside the project are not being checked until opened üòï Now this is a huge bump, having to run the check manually through console or build the whole app in order to check if one type alternation hasn‚Äôt influenced anything else? Madness‚Ä¶
This is when I decided to research this problem ‚Äî and there really is no out of the box solution! After trying every way on the internet I have finally pieced together the final solution for this problem:
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
      {
        "label": "tsc-watch project",
        "type": "typescript",
        "tsconfig": "tsconfig.json",
        "option": "watch",
        "problemMatcher": ["$tsc-watch"],
        "group": "build",
        "runOptions": {
          "runOn": "folderOpen"
        },
        "presentation": { "reveal": "never" }
      }
    ]
  }

This is an automated task for VSCode ‚Äî it runs when the project folder is opened and keeps on running, checking the whole repo real-time based on the changes you make! Finally! üéâ
Put it in

.vscode/tasks.json




Re-open the project folder and accept the popup asking whether Automatic Folder Tasks should be allowed
If the popup isn‚Äôt there do:
‚åò‚áßp
-> Manage Automatic Tasks in Folder
-> Allow Automatic Tasks in Folder



  
  
  üéâ All done! Enjoy your VSCode with TypeScript better than ever! üéâ]]></summary>

Multiple, unrelated commits cause similar errors, making maintenance difficult.
Legitimate issues may get ignored due to a high number of false positives.
Repetitive work is required to determine if bugs exist at all.
Diagnostics time increases as errors can be in the test or code.

Today I will be going over basic commands you can use to monitor system performance! üìàüìâüíª
The 'top' command is used to display active processes and how much they are using system resources.

lsof stands for list of open files- basically shows you list of files and the processes

'tcpdump' is used to analyze network traffic
'htop' is a lot like top - It's just allows you to monitor system resources or processes. As you can see, it's a bit more fancy than top

'iostat' is a command that is used to monitor input/output devices, by telling you how long the devices have been active.

Displays the processes

Tells you how long the system has been up

'free' shows you the amount of available memory you have.

Used to monitor individual tasks. Great for troubleshooting issues.

'w' tells you information about users logged on and their processes

These commands can be vital for you to monitor your system, so I will be releasing a part 2 soon, as well!üòÜ

Bom dia amigos, gostaria de citar alguns benef√≠cios de aprender e utilizar TypeScript em JavaScript.
Alguns motivos:
Temos a possibilidades de trabalhar com tipagem, algo muito √∫til para n√≥s desenvolvedores JavaScript.
Orienta√ß√£o a Objetos, sim, vamos poder usufruir de todo o poder desse paradigma (Class, Interface, Abstract), somando com a programa√ß√£o funcional nativa.
Melhora seu c√≥digo, seu c√≥digo vai se tornar mais coeso, bem divido, claro, se voc√™ usufruir de interfaces, classes abstratas e da boa e velha heran√ßa.
Muitas tecnologias utilizam ou d√£o suporte ao TypeScript: Angular, React, Graphql, Graphcool e etc.
Lembre-se TypeScript √© um supertest de JavaScript, ou seja, voc√™ pode implementar ele sem precisar usar esses frameworks citados acima.
Comece agora a utilizar TypeScript e eleve seu JavaScript para o pr√≥ximo n√≠vel. Vou deixar alguns links legais pra voc√™ estudar TypeScript:

Some of my pipelines runs on Linux and Mac, so I usually need to set up matrix to handle the different installation paths of Miniconda.
jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        include:
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            label: Linux
            prefix: /usr/share/miniconda3/envs/carsus

          - os: macos-latest
            label: macOS
            prefix: /Users/runner/miniconda3/envs/carsus

At the step level, install Miniconda without specifying a YAML environment file.
I choose the Mambaforge variant, which is basically a custom Miniconda build shipped with the lightning-fast mamba package manager and the conda-forge channel enabled.
- name: Setup Miniconda
  uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2
  with:
      miniforge-variant: Mambaforge
      miniforge-version: latest
      activate-environment: <your-env-name>
      use-mamba: true

The cache task work with keys. When the task is executed, looks for a saved cache that matches the key and retrieves the data.
Cache is specific for every OS. Also, I set up the key in a way that will update the cache every 24 hours or if the environment has changed.
- name: Set cache number
  run: echo "::set-output name=number::$(date +'%d%m')"
  id: cache-number

- uses: actions/cache@v2
  with:
    path: /usr/share/miniconda3/envs/carsus
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-conda-${{ hashFiles('<your-env-yaml-file>') }}-${{ env.CACHE_NUMBER }}
  env:
    CACHE_NUMBER: ${{ steps.cache-number.outputs.number }}
  id: conda-cache

Finally, if the cache is not available, update the environment according to the YAML environment file.
- name: Update environment
  run: mamba env update -n <your-env-name> -f <your-env-yaml-file>
  if: steps.conda-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true']]></summary>

#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <cerrno>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <netdb.h>
#include <string>
#include <sys/socket.h>

    hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_DGRAM;
    hints.ai_protocol = IPPROTO_UDP;

    struct addrinfo* result_addrinfo = nullptr;
    auto result = getaddrinfo("fe80::dabb:c1ff:fe0a:17f2%enp39s0", std::to_string(12345).c_str(), &hints, &result_addrinfo);
    if( result != 0 ){
        std::cout << "`getaddrinfo()` failed: " << gai_strerror(errno) << std::endl;
        return result;
    }

    for(
        struct addrinfo* info = result_addrinfo;
        info != nullptr;
        info = info->ai_next

        char ipv6addr_human_readable_form[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN] = {0, };

        auto ipv6_scope_id = ((struct sockaddr_in6*)(info->ai_addr))->sin6_scope_id;

        std::cout << "IPv6 address = " << ipv6addr_human_readable_form << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Scope-ID = " << std::to_string(ipv6_scope_id) << std::endl;
    }

    freeaddrinfo(result_addrinfo);
    return EX_OK;
}

Of course, the Scope-ID can also be obtained as previously. But is there an easier and shorter?
if_nametoindex()


Fortunately, Linux provides a function called if_nametoindex (). It returns the index number of the network interface, which is currently equal to the Scope-ID.
#include <net/if.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <sysexits.h>

int main(void)
{
    auto scope_id = if_nametoindex("enp39s0");
    std::cout << scope_id << std::endl;

    return EX_OK;
}

Now, the code became much shorter and easier. Also, there is no need to care to free memory!]]></summary>

Working with third parties, contractors and partners who need access to files containing protected data means walking a tightrope between providing useful data without violating privacy, HIPAA or GDPR. 
Let's remove protected data from a CSV without writing any code using an example file.

This walk-through will use remove-pii.com. Although we're working with a website, no data is transmitted to any server; all processing is handled in the browser. An offline version is also available.
Now, we'll provide our CSV to the website. This will parse the headers and allow us to replace any data within the file.  Any unset columns pass through to the final file.

Dropbox has their own PGP key because they upload it directly to the AUR that key is for linux@dropbox.com (if you don't know what PGP keys are it's basically a complex math formula that proves that this app is being uploaded and managed on the AUR by somebody at dropbox)
if you use a tool like yay or paru it can handle the functions of pacman and downloading stuff from the AUR and it's dead simple to use, I recommend paru because it's more modern and faster
To install paru run these commands
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git

cd paru

makepkg -si

After succesfully installing paru now it's time to install Dropbox. To do that first run
paru dropbox

Now you'll be prompt with a list of packages from AUR to choose from. You have to choose aur/dropbox which should be the first one... So press 1 and hit enter

If you want to review hit Y and enter

To close the review hit q on the the keyboard
Now you must prompt with installation confirmation. Hit Y and enter. You may need to enter your password for installation. 
After completion of you installation run dropbox on your terminal or search on the GUI

That's it!]]></summary>

In this quick tutorial, you will learn how to add a default value to an existing column in MySQL.
You always need to be careful, when changing the structure of an existing column in your database. Make sure to always have backups of your database before making such changes. 
For MySQL, you could use the following script to generate a backup of your database:
Script to backup a MySQL/MariaDB database
When making changes to a column in your database, you can use the ALTER TABLE statement followed by the ALTER COLUMN statement.
The syntax is the following:
ALTER TABLE name_of_the_table ALTER name_of_the_column SET DEFAULT your_new_default_value;

Let's say that we had a table called users and a column called is_admin. We want all new users to have the is_admin value set to 0. T‚Ä¶]]></summary>

Use the following script to receive Telegram notifications always your Github Actions is running.
    - name: Send Telegram Message Ok
        uses: appleboy/telegram-action@master
        env:
          GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJSON(github) }}

          to: ${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_ID }}

          format: markdown
          message: |
            *1st line of your message with bold*
            *2nd line of your message with bold, too*
            Application: *Write something to be put inside your message*. The below lines still are part of your message.          
            Branch: *${{ github.ref }}*
            Repository: *${{ github.repository }}*
            Owner: *${{ github.repository_owner }}*

If you want to go deeper into this component, go to project's github repository
As we can see, to use this component we need two important informations, the TELEGRAM_ID and the TELEGRAM_TOKEN.
To get your TELEGRAM_TOKEN, you will need to create a telegram's bot, do that starting a conversation with BotFather. Start a new conversation and search for @botfather.

You can start the conversation sending a /help message to see all options allowed. But if you want to skip this step, just send /newbot and follow the instructions. When finish bot's creation, you will receive a message with your bot's token, as show below:

Good job! Now you got your TELEGRAM_TOKEN, in this example it is 2063069520:AAE7Gcummn9fSp_xLQH7dBGihpzOyWQCm9g.
Now, let's find out your TELEGRAM_ID. Just search for @userinfobot and start a conversation with /star message. The result message will be like that:
@your_telegram_username
Id: 12345678
First: <Your Firstname>
Last: <Your Lastname>
Lang: en-US

Your TELEGRAM_ID is the number in second line, right between your username and firstname.
In this point you have all information to start sending notification messages at any pipeline in Github Actions.
Just add these information to repository secrets.]]></summary>

Nice to see you all around again! Today you'll find out how easy it is to use the  react-hook-form  library for forms instead of the normal method of forms in React.

So, the first thing is first, normally, in React we use state, and whenever the value of an input changes, we change the state. This method's good but there is a lot of code. Here's how the code looks like in this case.
import { useState } from 'react';

  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');

To get or access the properties and methods of the h6 HTML element tags without having errors or red squiggly lines in TypeScript, you have to assert the type for the h6 HTML element tag using the HTMLHeadingElement interface in TypeScript.
The errors or warnings are shown by the TypeScript compiler since the compiler doesn't know more information on the h6 HTML element tag ahead of time. But we know that we are referencing the h6 HTML tag and thus we can tell the compiler to use the HTMLHeadingElement interface which contains the declarations for properties and methods.

Scrollspy is a mechanism that highlights an active menu item based on current scroll position to indicate which section is currently visible in the viewport. It's available in Bootstrap (see the docs), but right now let's implement it from scratch using React and TypeScript.
Before we start, let's add some helper functions that we will use for computations in our hook. Also, this way we keep logic separated and make our code look cleaner.
// Restrict value to be between the range [0, value]
const clamp = (value: number) => Math.max(0, value);

// Check if number is between two values
const isBetween = (value: number, floor: number, ceil: number) =>
  value >= floor && value <= ceil;

Once we're ready with helpers, we can jump to the hook code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright lads, this will be a quick one. I want to add the views count functionality on my personal portfolio website's blog section.

Expected behavior:
  Blogs Page : List of blogs -> Show count.
 Blog Page : Particular Article -> Show count and  Increment count.
How to achieve:
Use supabase to store count by slug
Stored procedure to increment count
Tools that I'll need:
supabase : open source firebase alternative 
swr : data fetching
Create a table views with schema like such:
slug -> text -> primary key
created_at -> timestamp -> now()
count ->  int2 
count:



Fetch count
Increment one
Fetch count again
Now we can reduce this to one db call using stored procedures:

create function increment (slug_text text)
returns void as
$$
update views
set count = count + 1
where slug = slug_text;

I don't want to embed YouTube videos in my game. There's a few reasons for this:
TensorFlow.js (the machine learning platform that I'm using) can't analyze an embedded YouTube video. The video needs to be inside of an accessible <video> (or similar) element on the webpage and cannot be embedded.

For instance, here's a basic example:
function getAdditionalData(input) {
  const url = getRequestUrl(input);

  return makeHttprequest(url).then(response => {
    return response.data;
  });
}

app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
  const input = calculateInput();
  return getAdditionalData(input).then(result => {
    return { input, result };

This is a simple endpoint that calls getAdditionalData() to get some data and return to the user. The function does an asynchronous thing (HTTP request), so it returns a promise.

All the code regarding our deployment you can also find here:
https://github.com/TGotwig/devops
We take usage of an very nice and simple MEAN-Stack project which comes from Brad Traversy ü§ó
Download the sample repo and cd into it:
git clone git@github.com:TGotwig/devops.git
cd aws-cloudformation/solutions/advanced/mean-stack

Install the awscli from somewhere and login:
aws configure --profile <YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_NAME>

You will be asked for two IDs, you can get them through:

 

Create a file called parameters.json:
[
  {
    "ParameterKey": "KeyName",
    "ParameterValue": "<KeyName>"
  }
]

Replace <KeyName> by your SSH key under EC2 / Key Pairs:

Create a file called .env for the Makefile:
stack-name=simple-mean-stack
profile=<YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_NAME>
region=<YOUR_AWS_REGION>

Start it by running make up, an EC2 machine should boot up:

After some time we can reach the app, run make getUrl to get the url:

After refreshing the page few times you should see another IP:

You can remove the entire stack by running make rm! üî•

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Angular, we use HTTP to get data from backend,HTTP methods always return an observable.Generally we subscribe to that observable and assign response data to class variables to use it in our component.
But using RxJS operators we can compose multiple observables(data streams) or process  observable data  before subscribing to it.
RxJS concatMap operator
Observable emits observable).
concatMap operator
Takes each value from the outer observable and maps that value  to observable(called as inner observable) 
Concat all inner observables into a single observable in order  and subscribe to inner observables and emit data of each inner observable into output observable in sequential manner.
concatMap never subscribes to the next inner observable until the previous one completes.
Example:

Run live
Here we have 2 API‚Äôs
In the above case we need to take all roll numbers from the first API  and pass it to the second API.

So solution to this problem is use concatMap RxJS operator instead of nested subscription.

First contactMap operator -
getToppers_rollNum() this method returns an Observable of type number[] , conactMap  maps Observable<number[]> to Observable <number>(inner observable) then subscribes to inner observable and emit data into output observable(top_3_rollNum$).
Second  concatMap operator -
top_3_rollNum$ as outer observable.concatMap takes each roll number from the outer observable and hits http request sequentially(here we have 3 inner observables return by 3 http requests) & emits http response data into output observable(topper_marks$).
concatMap never hits the next http request until the previous one completes.
Shorthand syntax for above code

So,concatMap is used where sequence of execution matters.
