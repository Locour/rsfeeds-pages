It happens when we write useEffect hooks. We intend to just run some code when X changes, but then ESLint tells us to add Y and Z to the dependency list.
useEffect(() => {
  setCount(count + 1)
  // eslint-disable-next-line
}, [])

Ignoring this rule is very bad. It opens up our code to a class of weird bugs (ex: count gets a value from the past). But most importantly, it hides bad design in other parts of the component.
I can strongly claim that EVERY useEffect can be made compliant with the ESLint rule while still mantaining the desired behavior. The solutions might not be straightforward, but it is always better to change other parts of the code than to add the rule. The overal benefit will be more consistent code.

When you're adding authorization to an application, there are two crucial questions:
Are users that shouldn't have access actually out?
Are users that should have access actually in?
If you can't answer with certainty both questions, how can you claim to have a secure application? This is something that you can test manually, but a better alternative is test automation. Concretely, I think the best methodology to get there is using Test-Driven Development (TDD).
This piece is about adding authorization to a Ruby on Rails API by following TDD. You can check out this article to learn in detail how to secure a Rails API with Auth0. Also, you can follow this article along with this repository.

If you search in your setup of Gitlab and find a «blocked» pipeline — exactly this type of pipeline is the main reason for coverage score staling.
my-job:
    when: manual

To fix this you need to add only one line:
my-job:
    when: manual
    allow_failure: true

And poof, you get lucky, your coverage badge is free of the evil witch curse and updates as it should.
Recently Gitlab guys fixed that behavior. How exactly? Just added default value allow_failure: true for manual pipelines automatically. This is a very good decision, because otherwise, a single manual step may ruin the whole CI/CD prosperity of your project.
my-job:
    when: manual
    allow_failure: false

and poof once again — you are stuck with never-ever updating coverage badge. The fix is obvious — add «true» for allow_failure or strip this line. But I have no answer to a simple question: what we should do if we need manual pipelines with disabled failure option and updatable coverage badge? Probably, this question should be addressed directly to Gitlab.
This may not be so easy to grasp from official documentation, so I decided to write this article. I hope it helped.]]></summary>

What Are Containers?
Aren’t Containers Just For Larger Organizations?
What Can I Use Containers For?
Benefits Of Containerization
Since containers are designed to run alongside other containers, you can work on smaller aspects and microservices of a project while holding other containers constant. This also makes it easy to test a project with varying combinations of containers.

Now you realize I need to navigate to a directory inside another directory that is inside another. The chain continues for about 4-5 directories until you reach the required folder.
Such a mood spoiler, right! This potential move has the tendency to force you to get up from your desk and take a 5-minute break which can very quickly turn into a long break. 
See, the damaging domino effect it can have? Now you will argue, ah! You don't know, I can keep pressing the "up" arrow and find the command I need because I used it just about a few hours ago.

If you're running them in a pipeline, you have to figure out all of the resource ARNs and make sure you have permission to access each of them. Also, what happens if your integration tests fail? Do you send a notification so someone can manually redeploy the previous version?
Running integration tests in a CloudFormation custom resource simplifies a few of these issues. You can use references to other resources in the stack to get the required ARNs. You can use those same references to build execution rules for the integration test. Finally, if the integration tests fail, then CloudFormation will automatically roll back the deployment.

InterSystems IRIS 2019 is going to introduce new and exciting features. One of the areas with new interesting must-to-know things is the API Management. 
OpenAPI initiative (https://www.openapis.org/) is the organization supporting a standard specification to define APIs (https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification). The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Simila…]]></summary>

First, download the free Visual Studio Code IDE (@code) and install it on your development machine.
We will start with basic debugging using a very small test.js file and go to the debug view:

You'll notice we need to define a debug configuration first (at the top, click on "No configurations" and select "Add configuration". You'll see a "launch.json" file is created and select "Node.js: launch program":

Before working full-time on Medusa we did agency work for a handful of different e-commerce clients; one of them wanted to migrate away from their solution back then and when we couldn't find a new suitable platform for them we agreed to build a custom solution from scratch.

We consolidated the results generated by the platform to the project teams and made sure they didn’t have security or programming skills.
We didn’t set up any of our cyber value-at-risk enumerations, as they would apply to how an open-source library is used within the end-user application (i.e. types of data processed, quantity of data, environment etc.).

on the contrary windows takes 69 years to connect
software installation process with terminal was super straight forward, i loved it.
your imagination is the limit when it comes to customization
UI is ❤️😩 (or maybe windows UI is just too shitty)
The Bad
No Photoshop, No Office, No Vegas Pro
yes there are alternatives, like libreoffice, Gimph..
i hate them, they suck.
libreoffice works but best of luck with the formatting of files your friend sent you
random freezes, my laptop used to just freeze, nothing worked... tried everything under the sun to recover from this stuck phase and preventing it, even mad it to mint forums, nothing... only solution once there was to hard reboot.
poor software updates, third party software updates matter because the come baring bug fixes, third party software like slack, quickdock, even whatsaap for desktop, all plagued with bugs.
this one is not that significant but the booting time in Linux was a bit higher than the windows counterpart, not that noticeable in the long run but coming from windows immediately it caught my attention.
anywho, i came back into loving arms of windows in about two months into my Linux journey, do i regret it, No.
would i install Linux again, No.
do i feel line one os is superior than other, No.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I will show you how to install Docker in Linux Mint and Ubuntu. Docker is a very useful tool which every developer should know. Using Docker you can run many applications with special containers. They are beside your system. For instance you code in php and you need php in your system to run application. With Docker you can install and run many versions of php. Let’s start!
First of all we should update the package lists:
sudo apt-get update

Next we have to install dependencies:
sudo apt-get -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

Perhaps you have installed all dependencies. After installing dependencies we have to add GPG key:
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

and repository:
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release; echo "$UBUNTU_CODENAME") stable"

When we add a new repository we have to remember to update package lists. So one more time we run sudo apt-get update .
Then we can install Docker in Linux Mint and Ubuntu (we install also docker-compose):
sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose

After installing Docker we have to add our user to a docker group:
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

It is necessary in order to run Docker without root privileges (without sudo). In my opinion running Docker with sudo is not a good idea. Remember restart machine after adding your user to group!
We can check our installation:
docker -v
docker-compose -v
docker run hello world

You should see the version of docker and docker-compose.

I wrote a shell script which install Docker in Linux Mint and Ubuntu automatically:
You can get it on my GitHub.
You can see tutorial on YouTube.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A JavaScript superset, that builds up on JavaScript language, It adds new features to JavaScript, typescript cant run in the browser or even in NodeJS therefore it has a compiler that  compiles typescript to JavaScript. Added features in typescript include the use of types, it also helps us be more explicit and clearer about our code.
Lets look at two code snippets one with Plain Javascript and another in typescript .
Plain Javascript
  let inputA = 1
  let inputB = 2
  function sum(inputA, inputB){
     console.log(inputA + inputB)
  }
  sum(inputA,inputB)
  //this will return 3
  //Now what if we change the inputs to be
  inputA = "1"
  inputB = "2"
  sum(inputA,inputB)
 //this will return 12

Despite the second answer being wrong, we dont get an error notification at run time. Here is when typescript comes in with its additional type feature that guarantees we get the correct answer or an error.In typescript this would be written as(you can test this code in the TS playground):
    let inputA = 1
    let inputB = 2
    funtion sum(inputA: number,inputB: number){
     console.log(inputA + inputB)
    }
    sum(inputA,inputB)
    //prints 3
    //Now what if we change the inputs to be
    inputA = "1"
    inputB = "2"
    sum(inputA,inputB)
    //script.ts(6,9): error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.


Through the introduction of types in typescript, it easier to write more intuitive code. I will be writing a series of tutorial on typescript.
I will cover:
Typescript Basics
Typescript compiler
Classes & Interfaces
Advanced Typescript features such as Generics & Decorators
Stay tuned !!]]></summary>

Microsoft Windows is with us from the start of OS development, from 1985. But this is also not the reason you shouldn't hate Windows.
The only reason I am stuck on Linux/Debian OS is that it is good enough to fulfil my requirements. Similarly, many people are stuck in Windows because it is good enough to fulfil their requirements. 
Well, one of my college friends tried Linux, he search for a piece of software to do some writing stuff, he got LibreOffice, and tried it. FOR HIM, LibreOffice wasn't good enough. I told him to use Google Docs as well, but at the end of the day, it didn't match with him.
Also, he was a Valorant player friend. He search how to install Valorant in Linux? And guess what, he got disappointed, Valorant isn't playable in Linux, aka: BANNED
So, we need to keep in mind that if something fulfils our requirement why one should change he/her workflow.
In a nutshell, we all want our tasks to be accomplished as soon as possible. If something we currently own and does the task we want without any issue, we're good to go with it.

To install Certbot, you should have Snap installed as well. For instructions, follow this tutorial.

Then, update snap
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
To use Certbot you should have server_name in your Ngnix config. For example, this is a sample of how my Nginx config file looked like before Certbot.
server{
        root /home/pi/website;
        server_name example.slashtechno.com;
}

Once you have the config set up properly, restart nginx. On most systems it will be the following command.

A lot of grey area exists between SAM and the CDK. SAM makes it nice to verify things locally before pushing out to AWS, CDK doesn't provide anything other than seeing your initial stack. So the dev process for the cdk looks like, read docs -> write js -> deploy to CloudFormation (typically a few minutes for anything more than a s3 bucket) -> manually verify  -> repeat. Not a fast process at all. Honestly if you could just take the support for local debugging from SAM and give it to the CDK it'd be near perfect.
CDK documentation is pretty confusing. Somewhat understandable given how young it is, but still. Also doesn't help that a lot of the guides that exist are also outdated. Some even coming from AWS themselves. There's also a lot modules in th…]]></summary>

So I thought I would introduce a simple way for Node developers to take an audio file that is uploaded through the browser and send it to a backend Express.js server.
Let's start on the backend with our Express.js server. Express.js is a Node.js framework that provides us with so many useful methods and middleware, making working in Node that much easier.
We'll set up the server and implement a middleware package called Multer that helps us handle different file types that we receive to our post endpoint.

        <link href="https://dev.to/karladler/extend-svgicon-sizes-in-react-material-ui-44f8"/>
        <updated>2021-11-18T13:05:03.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using React Material UI you have the opportunity to use any SVG file like an icon. To do so, you just wrap it into the SvgIcon component.
An example for your HomeIcon component might look like this:
import React from 'react';
import { SvgIcon, SvgIconProps } from '@mui/material';
import { ReactComponent as HomeSvg } from '../../assets/Icons/Home.svg';

function HomeIcon(props: SvgIconProps) {
  return (
    <SvgIcon component={HomeSvg} viewBox="0 0 24 24" {...props} />
  );
}

export default HomeIcon;

Importing svg files as react components required svgr, otherwise you would need to use the SVG code as children of SvgIcon
With SvgIcon you have the possibility to set the fontSize attribute to "small", "inherit", "large" or "medium", but what if we if we would need more of this?
<HomeIcon fontSize="small" />
<HomeIcon />
<HomeIcon fontSize="large" />
<HomeIcon sx={{ fontSize: 40 }} />

Here is where component variants come into play.
In our theme we just add a new variant to the MuiSvgIcon component. E.g. we we want an new size called huge we do it like this:
components: {
   MuiSvgIcon: {
      variants: [
        {
          props: { fontSize: 'huge' },
          style: {
            fontSize: '5rem',
          },
        },
      ],
    },
}

That should already work, but when we are using typescript and setting it, the compiler will complain.
<HomeIcon fontSize="huge" />

So we need to extend the interface for the component too:
declare module '@mui/material/SvgIcon' {
  interface SvgIconPropsSizeOverrides {
    huge: true;
  }
}

Just add the above module declaration e.g. to your theme.ts  and that's it.]]></summary>

Onion Architecture leads to more maintainable applications since it emphasizes separation of concerns throughout the system.” Jeffery Palermo

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Schematics are very useful. They provide us to achieve more in a shorter amount of time. But most significantly used, we can think less about routine stuff which leaves our limited attention span to focus on solving real changes.
Ensure that you have the following packages installed at a global level on your computer. Note that in a real-life development context, you should have some of these local to your project. But for the having well been stable development environment we will install them globally.
node v12.8.0 npm v.6.10.2 @angular-cli (core y cli) v.10 @schematics/angular @schematics/schematics@0.1000.5
This allows us to use the schematics command and specifically the blank schematics to generate a new schematics project where we can start implementing our custom schematics.

So Let's Begin!
Generate a random password, according to the user input.
Get user input
Create lists for letters etc...
Loop over lists and make a password.
Print the password.
Get user input
Here we will use try/except blocks so that when user types a string we do not get an error.
We will get inputs for number of special characters, small letters, big letters and numbers required for generating the password.
Code:
try:
        num_of_numbers = int(input("How many numbers should your password have: "))

If you’re a developer just starting out on a project and can’t decide which JavaScript framework to use, this guide should help.
React is a user interface library, Angular is a front-end framework, and Vue.js is a progressive framework.
They can be used almost interchangeably to build front-end applications, but they are not identical, so it is important to compare them and understand their differences.
Each framework is component-based, allowing for the rapid development of UI features.
In this segment, we’ll look at various aspects of Angular, Vue, and React to see how they can meet your needs. This post is not just a comparison of Angular vs. React vs. Vue, but it a…]]></summary>

XML: Back in the late 90s to mid 2000s this was king both as a messaging protocol and flat file format. It gets a bad rap, but there is a lot to like about XML as a config file format, including great tooling support and a robust schema definition language in XSD.
