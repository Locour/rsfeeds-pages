It seemed to require extensive and comprehensive knowledge and understanding of commands and keyboard shortcuts. However, as I read more about it and practiced what I learned, I realized that it isn't as scary as it seemed; that It only requires a lot of constant practice. I also discovered that others feel the same way, which made me realise that I wasn't alone.
The other thing I discovered during this period is that we are all beginners and sharing is helpful, since no one is an island. So I decided to share my experience with others starting out as well. As we all know, learning is never-ending. There will always be new tools and new commands to learn, especially when you're a beginner. The followin…]]></summary>

Scrollspy is a mechanism that highlights an active menu item based on current scroll position to indicate which section is currently visible in the viewport. It's available in Bootstrap (see the docs), but right now let's implement it from scratch using React and TypeScript.
Before we start, let's add some helper functions that we will use for computations in our hook. Also, this way we keep logic separated and make our code look cleaner.
// Restrict value to be between the range [0, value]
const clamp = (value: number) => Math.max(0, value);

// Check if number is between two values
const isBetween = (value: number, floor: number, ceil: number) =>
  value >= floor && value <= ceil;

Once we're ready with helpers, we can jump to the hook code.

How to achieve:
Use supabase to store count by slug
Stored procedure to increment count
Tools that I'll need:
supabase : open source firebase alternative 
swr : data fetching
Create a table views with schema like such:
slug -> text -> primary key
created_at -> timestamp -> now()
count ->  int2

Fetch count
Increment one
Fetch count again
Now we can reduce this to one db call using stored procedures:

create function increment (slug_text text)

For instance, here's a basic example:
function getAdditionalData(input) {
  const url = getRequestUrl(input);

  return makeHttprequest(url).then(response => {
    return response.data;
  });
}

app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
  const input = calculateInput();
  return getAdditionalData(input).then(result => {
    return { input, result };

});

This is a simple endpoint that calls getAdditionalData() to get some data and return to the user. The function does an asynchronous thing (HTTP request), so it returns a promise.

During this period most of the time, I’ve used PHP as backend but recently my company assigned me to a project in which I had to use Node(Express) as backend. So here’s the story about my first MERN stack app.
TLDR

During this short period of my career, I got the opportunity to work with several technologies. As I’m working as a Full-Stack dev so previously I had hands-on experience with Laravel, React, Vue, Mysql other related techs. I was very excited when my company assigned me to a MERN stack app. That was a huge transition. I took that as a challenge and decided that I’d prepare myself for larger apps built with the MERN stack. So that’s why even the purpose of the app is simple but the structure is not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Kubernetes service is a logical abstraction for a group of pods in a cluster (all performing the same function).
Since pods are ephemeral, a service enables a group of pods that provide certain functions (web services, image processing, etc.) to be assigned a name and a unique IP address (clusterIP). As long as the service uses this IP address, it does not change. Services also define policies for their access.
In Kubernetes, a deployment is a way to start a pod of containerized applications and ensure that the required number of replicas are always running on the cluster. 
A service, on the other hand, is responsible for exposing an interface to these pods which enables network access either within the cluster or between external processes and the service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Docker Tips - UFW


By default docker will override the "Uncomplicated Firewall" (UFW) rules, it is important to be aware of this so that you do not accidentally expose your docker containers to the world.
If you had UFW configured to block port 3000, then you would be forgiven for assuming our docker app would also be blocked.
docker run -d -p 3000:5000 training/webapp python app.py
However, docker adds rules to IP tables directly. This bypasses UFW which causes our app to be exposed to the world.
The problem is that our port mapping tag exposes our app:
-p 3000:5000
Restricting access to localhost is a simple change:
-p 127.0.0.1:3000:5000
This binds port 5000 inside the container to port 3000 on the localhost or 127.0.0.1 interface on the host machine.
Our app is now blocked from external traffic!
GCP, AWS and even OVH all have external firewalls that sit infront of the server. Leveraging cloud based firewalls in addition to UFW is the best way to solve the issue.]]></summary>

When our applications become bigger or if we are getting into making it modular, multiple containers come into play. Here's where things get tricky. For example, if we are running an e-commerce application - our auth/login, payment services, product catalogues, inventory management will run as individual containers or services - this is the microservices approach.

Developers are switching from Flask to FastAPI for a lot of reasons like speed, for instance.
This is techempower.com, an independent website that benchmarks web servers by running a variety of tests on them, FastAPI (with Uvicorn, the ASGI server implementation) is one of the fastest web servers.

And why I prefer FastAPI over others Fws is because of its high performance, ease of syntax, you have something like Pydantic that allows modern python typing, also asynchronous requests with Async/Await syntax .. and no wonder that FastAPI is on par with Go language and Node JS (which is built on the V8 engine, the same engine of Google Chrome)
Take a look at my latest video on the channel where you can learn how to build user authentication with web based tokens using JWTs ( pronounce Jots) or JSON Web Tokens; and how this is better than the traditional cookie based sessions

Cada container em um pod executa no próprio cgroup, mas eles comparilham alguns namespaces.

In this article, let us learn about how we can render dynamic content to the client (which is not static). Let us first touch briefly on what a template engine is because rendering dynamic content is closely related to what a template engine will help us in achieving. 

A template engine is software designed to combine templates with a data model to produce multiple pages that share the same look throughout the site. These are the views in an MVC project.
So this helps us in putting dynamic content on our HTML pages. 
We got a HTML like template (technically not HTML) which is typically a file that contains a lot of HTML like content in it but with some placeholders plugged into it and then we have a server (a Node.js Express server or any other server) serving the Node/…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Angular, we use HTTP to get data from backend,HTTP methods always return an observable.Generally we subscribe to that observable and assign response data to class variables to use it in our component.
But using RxJS operators we can compose multiple observables(data streams) or process  observable data  before subscribing to it.
RxJS concatMap operator
Observable emits observable).
concatMap operator
Takes each value from the outer observable and maps that value  to observable(called as inner observable) 
Concat all inner observables into a single observable in order  and subscribe to inner observables and emit data of each inner observable into output observable in sequential manner.
concatMap never subscribes to the next inner observable until the previous one completes.
Example:

Run live
Here we have 2 API’s
In the above case we need to take all roll numbers from the first API  and pass it to the second API.

So solution to this problem is use concatMap RxJS operator instead of nested subscription.

First contactMap operator -
getToppers_rollNum() this method returns an Observable of type number[] , conactMap  maps Observable<number[]> to Observable <number>(inner observable) then subscribes to inner observable and emit data into output observable(top_3_rollNum$).
Second  concatMap operator -
top_3_rollNum$ as outer observable.concatMap takes each roll number from the outer observable and hits http request sequentially(here we have 3 inner observables return by 3 http requests) & emits http response data into output observable(topper_marks$).
concatMap never hits the next http request until the previous one completes.
Shorthand syntax for above code

So,concatMap is used where sequence of execution matters.

By adding secondary entrypoints, we basically split our Angular libraries into multiple chunks, just like Angular Material does.
// One entrypoint: 
import { MatButtonModule, MatCardModule } from '@angular/material';

// With secondary entrypoints:

To convert an entire object to a read-only or a constant object, you can use the as keyword after the object initialization followed by the keyword const in TypeScript.
// using "as" keyword after the person
// object initialisation followed by the keyword "const"
// to make the object readonly or a constant object
const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,
} as const;

// change the "name" property value
person.name = "Hello"; // ❌ not allowed. Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.

For example, let' say we have an object called person with 2 properties called name and age having values of John Doe and 23 respectively like this,
// a simple object
const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 23,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Very recently, AWS announced Vault Lock for AWS backup. This new feature enables the protection of backups from accidental or malicious actions.  Behind the scenes, this extra safeguard is made possible by storing backups using a Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) model. 
The main reason to rehash this? Unique features like this seem to stay under the radar way too often. Secondly, if you already use AWS Backup, then enabling this extra protection is almost effortless.
Here's an example of AWS Backup Vault using Locks in CloudFormation:
  SomeBackupVault:
    Type: AWS::Backup::BackupVault
    DeletionPolicy: Retain
    UpdateReplacePolicy: Retain
    Properties:
      BackupVaultName: SomeBackupVault

You know all about phishing. From time to time, emails purporting to be from Facebook or your bank drift into your inbox and insist you “verify your account.” Look closer and you spot the telltale signs of a scam: a sketchy-looking sender address, sloppy writing, and a complete lack of personalization. You sigh and hit delete.
It’s easy to be cynical about opportunistic, mass-mailed phishing attempts. Although some look genuine to even the most cautious eye, others feel decidedly amateurish and are readily identifiable. Billions of emails are sent each month, with over 245,000 phishing-related websites created in January alone according to the Anti-Phish…]]></summary>

Role-Based Access Control, also known as RBAC, is one of the most common strategies to restrict access to protected resources within an organization. It simplifies permission assignment by categorizing users in roles. However, many people making their first foray into RBAC have questions:
How can you reflect this user categorization on your application to check users' privileges?
How can you deal with roles in your code?
Is role control appropriate for Web APIs?
