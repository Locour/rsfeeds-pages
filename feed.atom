The Virtual DOM was initially pioneered by the React authors on the basis of making delarative JavaScript patterns performant - but how? To understand this, we need to quickly review how traditional DOM manipulation works.
Generally speaking, the easiest way of changing the DOM ("Modifying the HTML") is to mutate the innerHTML property on an element. For example, if I want to add a div element in the document body, I could do something like this:
document.body.innerHTML = '<div>Hello World!</div>';
// <body> now has a <div>Hello World!</div> child.

This seems to be computationally performant, but it really isn't. While the action of reassignment is computationally performant, the DOM repaint ("Updating what the user sees") is not…]]></summary>

So I’ve been learning SQL and something came to my mind. How safe is this, I won’t lie I’ve heard of SQL injections before but never really got into it. But now I know it’s really a dangerous tool if you are not doing things correctly, and the best way of preventing this is knowing how to do it. Also for what I’ve investigated it seems that a lot of sites are vulnerable to this kind of attacks so we have to make awareness of the topic.
The vulnerability is because we are concatenating to the SQL request, making it possible for people to modify the request using their knowledge on how it works. This is further explained in the original article. Sorry for the inconvenience but I found it impossible to structure it here in dev.to]]></summary>

I am glad to return with news on my web project "Listings". A contributor really decoupled front JS code into a much cleaner and maintainable code.
However, follow me for a second, I have an opportunity for anyone to contribute under some conditions.
First, let me recall that I used a lot of JS libraries and snippets for front-end; I still let myself tempted with your own libraries or snippets.
Now, let me lay down the conditions that I see reasonable in this context:
At least 5 stars on Github
Clean and versioned code
Less than 10 kb minified
Has an added value
Now, I know the last one is a bit eclectic, but let me give you examples of current libraries used so that you picture the wide range of possibilities:
pell: the simplest and smallest WYSIWYG text editor for web, with no dependencies repo

tagify: lightweight, efficient Tags input component in Vanilla JS / React / Angular / Vue repo

toasty: A minimal JavaScript notification plugin that provides a simple way to display customizable toast messages on the web page with CSS3 transition effects. repo

holmes: Fast and easy searching inside a page repo It uses microlight also.
auto-complete:  An extremely lightweight and powerful vanilla JavaScript completion suggester. repo

jsi18n: Simple client side internationalization with javascript. repo 
avatar: Library for showing Gravatars or generating user avatars. repo 
FontPicker: Font selector component for Google Fonts . repo

stretchy: Form element autosizing, the way it should be. repo



As you can see, the list is big, but it would be suitable if you can deploy the website to get a taste of it and discover functionalities so you can suggest your library.
Let me know in comments if you have any question, also if you need help deploying the web-app.
Thanks a lot !]]></summary>

SRI é uma especificação da W3C que permite aos desenvolvedores web garantir que os recursos hospedados em servidores de terceiros não foram adulterados. Seu uso é recomendado como boa prática, sempre que as bibliotecas são carregadas de uma fonte de terceiro.
O HTTPS garante que a conexão entre o navegador e o servidor seja segura. O próprio recurso ainda pode ser modificado no lado do servidor por um invasor para incluir conteúdo malicioso, mas ainda pode ser servido com um certificado válido. O SRI, por outro lado, garante que um recurso não mudou desde que o hash foi criado.

It is imperative to choose the correct form of technology that helps you achieve what you want and helps in achieving your aim. A wrong decision can eat your time and leave your project in shambles. 
Why Choose Angular For Web Development? Let us look into some of the reasons for choosing Angular for your next project and how it will impact your business.
Parented by Google
Fulfills the Requirements
Purposefully informative
Checks and balances
The first impression is the last
using Angular CLI. All the components have predefined styles which help in the fast delivery of the service. Angular Material documentation is replete with the necessary examples which are required.
Package in itself
SPAs
Module Based
Friendly user-experience
Concluding to the final question- is it still relevant given that it has been here for a decade Yes! Absolutely! It is up-to-date and quite efficient in helping you build modern products. It is supported, powered, and parented by Google, and that in itself makes Angular's future bright. However, depending upon your project, the choice of the framework should be taken judiciously. The angular ecosystem is vast and continues to bring a lot to the table. The core team releases biannual versions, making it always excitable for the next updated version.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article we will explain how to create an ec2 ubuntu instance with the Teamcity server installed.
To begin with in this case we will create an instance from an Ubuntu 20.0 image. However, you can take a look at other alternatives that Amazon provides for us here: here.
When we are creating this instance it's important to save the pem file, so that you can access the machine through ssh.
After we have created the instance we will go to security and use the Public IPv4 DNS, in order to create a CNAME record on your domain to access that machine. 
Access to the machine




> ssh -i "<file_name>.pem" ubuntu@ec2-ip-address.sa-east-1.compute.amazonaws.com

Install java 8 to install teamcity




> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk

Check the java version




> java -version

Download the Teamcity Server, in our case we downloaded the latest version: 2020-2




> sudo wget https://download-cf.jetbrains.com/teamcity/TeamCity-<version>.tar.gz

> tar xfz TeamCity-<version>.tar.gz

> sudo useradd teamcity
> sudo chown -R teamcity:teamcity TeamCity

To change the server port, in the <TeamCityHome>/conf/server.xml file, change the port number in the not commented  XML node (here the port number is 8111):
Now if you browse the IP address of your server using port 8111 you should see the TeamCity web interface.
Before creating the projects we need to create at least one build agent.
> cd Teamcity/buildAgent/build
> sudo sh install.sh localhost

Finally we need to run our TeamCity Server with the following command line from:  <TeamCityHome>/bin .
> sudo sh runAll.sh start

We strongly recommend that you use docker instead of installing everything locally on this server, so that you can dockerize all your applications.
You can find more information about how to Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu, here: (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) 
Moreover, in my previous post you can read about Dockerizing an angular app.

Here, how anyone can do it.
Open Command prompt or Powershell 
pip install --upgrade pip
pip3 install virtualenvwrapper-win

Remember :- Python.3x - uses pip3 and Python.2x - uses pip
Creating, working and deleting specific python virtual environment
mkvirtual env1
deactivate

workon env1
pip3 install flask
decativate

rmvirtualenv env1

This is like, we can create multiple python virtual environment in C Drive at specific location and can be accessable it from anywhere, if we working on any project or doing something.
Screenshot - cmd

venv for certain task


Let's do it.
Open bash ( Terminal )

if not installed, we can install now
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip3
pip3 install --upgrade pip3

Then installing virtual environment
sudo pip3 install virtualenvwrapper
sudo pip3 install virtualenvwrapper-win

Creating any folder in home directory, like
mkdir pyenvs

Making changes to the .bashrc file
sudo nano ~/.bashrc

You will see like this screen

Scroll down (or use Down key ) till the end, then Copy and Paste these below script but find the "Your_user_name" by command uname -r and  version of python as python3.7, python3.8 and python3.9 etc using which python3.
For example: In my case,
'/home/ajay/pyens'
'/usr/bin/python3.9'





export WORKON_HOME='/home/Your_user_name/pyens'
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON='/usr/bin/python3.x'
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

Ctrl+S (save) and Ctrl+X (moving out from the file)
And creating python virtual environment either single or multiple times is same as like in windows.
bash ( Terminal )


Screenshot - bash

Typescript has an amazing support of types, generics and type inference. It's also possible to generate a large amount of utility types through generics to make your typescript functions far better suited to use composition or inheritance instead of the specific objects. In this article, I will do a short-dive into the vast possibilities possible with types. However, sometimes it's difficult to imagine one-self using these types, when reading about them, so hopefully the examples I've brought from my own experience will at least resemble to issues you yourself might've encountered.

When doing the import method, I found we were actually only loading the code at load time, and the files were being manpulated during runtime.
import payload from './payload.json';

This method didn't work when supplying data for API's. 
The solution was to load in the files using the Node FileSystem module. 
The snippet below shows how to do it.
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

const filepath = path.join(__dirname, 'payload.json');

const filePayloadRaw = fs.readFileSync(filepath, 'utf8');

const filePayload = JSON.parse(filePayloadRaw);

Few Notes on the above.
__dirname is an inbuilt variable to essentially give you the current directory location. This is important as when you run the node using Typescript, you will be in a src/ directory, so when you build it, the file location is wrong because you are executing from the /dist directory. __dirname gives you the runtime location. 


fs.readFileSync() needs to be passed in a character encoding. Additionally fs also provides a readFile() function which is async.


The raw result from fs is not usable until you parse it with the JSON library.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Closures could sometimes be tricky to the point that you may find out things too late/costly.
Look at this code fragment:
let a = [1, 2, 3];
let fn = [];
for (x of a) fn.push(() => x);
for (f of fn) console.log(f());

Simply, we've added three functions to fn that each should return their corresponding value of list a. So, we expect to see this as output:
0
1
2

But it's not what's going to happen. If you run the code you'll end up seeing this absurd thing:
3
3
3

Now, you can guess what has happened. The variable x is not even evaluated at the time of running the first loop. This is actually the correct behaviour, since we just declared a function that maybe called later, but certainly not now. The three functions are all ready to read the content of x whenever they've been called, and at that time x was ended up being 3.
This is quite common to have such setup in which you're using the loop's variable inside an anonymous function. To make sure you don't fall in, pass the value of the loop variable to your function. That is:
let a = [1, 2, 3];
let fn = [];
for (x of a)
  fn.push(
    (function (v) {
      return () => v;
    })(x)
  );
for (f of fn) console.log(f());

Here, I've used both syntaxes of anonymous function definitions to make things clean/separate. I'm sure you got the point, but in case you're interested to know more, have a look on these great posts:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nullish Coelescing in TypeScript is practically a shortcut for the ternary operator, achieved by using ?? between statements or values.
The double question marks work from left to right. Take the basic example below:
const value1 = undefined;
const value2 = 6;

const result = value1 ?? value2;

console.log(result); // returns 6

This reads as follows:
"If value1 is not null or undefined and has an actual value, then return that value. However, if value1 does not have a value, then return value2"
It's important to note that in the case of nullish coelescing, only null or undefined are being checked specifically. This should not be confused with checking for "truthyness" like the logical || operator would.
Take the below examples as a final explanation on this:
const b = "" ?? 42;
console.log(b); // returns ""

const c = false ?? 42;
console.log(c); // returns false

const d = NaN ?? 42;
console.log(d); // returns NaN

const e = -0 ?? 42;

The degree is the number of edges that are connected to a vertex, for example, the vertex A has a degree of 1 and the vertex C has a degree of 2.
Graphs can be either directed or undirected, directed graphs are like a one-way street, undirected is like a two-way street.

Graphs can also have cycles.

Graphs might be a disconnected one, that means it consists of isolated subgraphs, or a connected one, in which all every pair of nodes are connected by an edge.

Graphs can be used to represent networks, websites structure, also used in path optimization algorithms, there are applications in other fields, such as linguistics, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The join method is used to join the elements of an array together to create a string. It takes an argument for the delimiter that is used to separate the array elements in the string.


Here's an example:




let arr = ["Playstation", "Rules"];
let str = arr.join(" ");

str would have a value of the string Playstation Rules.


Let's use the join method (among others) inside the sentensify function to make a sentence from the words in the string str. The function should return a string. For example, I-like-Star-Wars would be converted to I like Star Wars.




function sentensify(str) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}
sentensify("May-the-force-be-with-you");

Answer:




function sentensify(str) {
return str.split(/\W/).join(" ")

}
console.log(sentensify("May-the-force-be-with-you")); will return May the force be with you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The split method splits a string into an array of strings. It takes an argument for the delimiter, which can be a character to use to break up the string or a regular expression. For example, if the delimiter is a space, you get an array of words, and if the delimiter is an empty string, you get an array of each character in the string.


Here are two examples that split one string by spaces, then another by digits using a regular expression:




let str = "Hello World";
let byWords = str.split(" ");

let otherString = "How9are7you2today";
let byDigits = otherString.split(/\d/);

// byWords would have the value ["Hello", "World"]
// byDigits would have the value ["How", "are", "you", "today"]

Now let's use the split method inside the splitify function to split str into an array of words. The function should return the array. Note that the words are not always separated by spaces, and the array should not contain punctuation.




function splitify(str) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}
splitify("Hello World,I-am code");

If you remember from my other posts simply split the string to create a new array of words. A simple regular expression can be used to achieve this result.
/\W/ Matches any non-word character. This includes spaces and punctuation, but not underscores. It’s equivalent to /[^A-Za-z0-9_]/


Answer:




function splitify(str) {
let splitWords = str.split(/\W/)
return splitWords

}
console.log(splitify("Hello World,I-am code"));

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A side effect of the sort method is that it changes the order of the elements in the original array. In other words, it mutates the array in place. One way to avoid this is to first concatenate an empty array to the one being sorted (remember that slice and concat return a new array), then run the sort method.
Use the sort method in the nonMutatingSort function to sort the elements of an array in ascending order. The function should return a new array, and not mutate the globalArray variable.








var globalArray = [5, 6, 3, 2, 9];
function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}
nonMutatingSort(globalArray);

Answer:




var globalArray = [5, 6, 3, 2, 9];
function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
let copy = [...arr];
  copy.sort((a, b) => {
     return a - b;
})
     return copy;
}
console.log(nonMutatingSort(globalArray)); will return [2, 3, 5, 6, 9]

OR




var globalArray = [5, 6, 3, 2, 9];
function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
  return [].concat(arr).sort(function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  });
}
nonMutatingSort(globalArray);

Code Explanation:
First we concatenate the array taken in as a parameter to a new empty array.
Then Use the sort() method create a function to sort the new array in ascending order.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running a bash script is easy, but it does take a few steps and it’s important to do them in the right order. In this post, we’ll go through the steps to ensure that your script will run correctly 😉
The first step is to make a bash script. Any bash script uses the Linux commands.  A script can simply be a file with a list of commands and the .sh extension. If you are new to Linux, you can use this site to practice. 
The second step is to make sure that your script file is executable. In Linux and macOS, you can check if a file is executable by running the ls -l command and then looking for an x in the permissions column. 
The example below shows the difference:
$ ls -l *.sh
-rwxrwxr-x 1 frank frank   43 mei 29 16:30 hello.sh
-rw-rw-r-- 1 frank frank 8192 jul  1 19:41 not-executable.sh

If it isn’t executable, run the following command in Terminal.
chmod +x script.sh

To start a script you write:
./script.sh

I can write a shell script when I need to, but then continue working in Python or Perl or C++ or whatever real programming language I'm most comfortable with at the time (these days mostly C++).
For example, one of my recent side projects involved crunching data from a database, working with various embedded systems and more. Shell is not the right tool for that kind of application.
Bash is more suited for when you write a lot of commands in the shell anyway and want to automate that.]]></summary>

Modern employees require more flexibility than their previous counterparts. 
54% of employees say they’d rather shift to a career that offers them more flexibility. In other words, organizations are more likely to retain employees if they offer flexible work arrangements.
But shifting from in-person work to remote work comes with a full host of changes (and something to keep in mind when starting a business). The most crucial one? Making sure your remote team is set up to work safely and securely. 
But before we touch on 10 tips to improve your remote team’s security, let’s take a look at the importance of safe and secure remote working.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have discovered and used vim as my primary text editor for the past few years.
Vim, an acronym meaning Vi IMproved, is a ubiquitous text editor available on nearly every system imaginable. 
Even in the most arcane corners of life, you will find a version of vim. From the data center to the local science lab to the classroom to the server farm, there is probably a version of vim running.
Vim is a text editor that operates in the console. It is very popular among programmers, and is particularly well-suited to editing source code.

Vim is often used by terminal users. But it can also be used inside modern IDEs (vim mode) and there are graphical versions as well (gVim)
In this post, I'm going to lay out a Hacker's Guide to Vim. This will be a collection of the best "Vim resources" that I have come across. 
Vim is a very complex tool with hundreds of commands and thousands of plugins that can be used to extend Vim and add functionality. So where do you start?
You can learn vim by exercise. This site offers interactive exercises. Vim is one of the programs you learn by doing.
Of course, the official vim website is a good resource as well. It has some documentation and lets you download vim. If you use Linux vim or vi is probably already installed, the same for Mac OS X users.
How to setup vim for Python. I find it quite useful, as I write quite a lot of Python code. Of course you can write Python code in any editor you want, I find for small scripts it's very practical to fire up vim.
An introduction to vim. This article shows you the basics of vim. How to open a terminal, vim and how to quit (ESC ZQ).
Settings up vim for javascript. If you write a lot of JS code, you can use vim. You can also use vim-mode inside visual studio code or phpstorm.
A cheatsheet for vim. Shows an overview for the vim commands. While a cheat sheet is useful, i think it's better to practice a lot with the commands.
A list of vim plugins. Personally I use NerdTree quite a bit.
Do you know any others? Which plugins do you use?]]></summary>

TL;DR: This blog post illustrates how to implement verifiable credentials using MATTR's Auth0 Marketplace integration. Our example features a fictitious university that issues digital credentials for students to use at various retail and hospitality locations—the university benefits by reducing the cost to produce and maintain physical ID cards. Students minimize PII (personally identifiable information) exposure with third-party organizations and the university (i.e., where their credentials are presented).

If you ever wanted to add methods to a built-in type like Number or String in JavaScript, you could extend the prototype directly:
// Add helper function to number
Object.defineProperty(Number.prototype,'clamp',{

    enumerable: false,
    value: function(min, max) {
        return Math.min(Math.max(min, this), max);

While using software may seem like a simpler method, keeping your software safe from piracy can be difficult. The software used to protect your program can be hacked, rendering it useless as a defensive measure.
Tenacious hackers can subvert the detection and encryption mechanisms put in place to keep them away from protected software resources. Using a physical form of defense like a USB copy protection dongle provides an additional level of security that must be breached to gain access to the projected resource. It’s not a perfect method but is widely used by software developers to protect their work.

LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is a standard disk management feature available in every version of Linux. The volume manager provides a new level of interaction between your operating system and disks or volumes which this system is using. In a conventional disk management pattern, Linux looks for available drives first, and then checks what volumes are available on these devices.
With the help of LVM, disks or volumes can be united into a single space. If the disk space is treated like tha…]]></summary>

ng add @nguniversal/express-engine

Once this is done, let's quickly check if SSR is working as per our expectation.
npm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr

Node server fires up on port 4000 and I check for my webpage's source.
view-source:http://localhost:4000/


ng add @angular/pwa

No extra configurations so far, and that's how it will be. Let's build our universal application once again and serve it on localhost:4000.
But wait!!! Now when I view my webpage source on the browser, I get this:

So does this mean that my SSR is broken?
Nope! My SSR is perfectly fine :-) Let's run a quick check to prove this. Open up POSTMAN and run a GET request against http://localhost:4000. And voila! I see my server-side-rendered page once again!

--
index.html is now cached by service-worker at the browser. The browser does not need to wait for the server to render the content any more, and it simply serves the cached version, and Angular takes over thereafter, like a normal SPA. Open up ngsw-config.json and verify that index.html is one of the cached resources.

Note (and a small exercise): If you remove index.html from ngsw-config.json and re-build your universal, you would see that the server-rendered content is back on your browser source, since the HTML is now no longer being cached!

This is for if you have troubles downloading large files while on a company network, or want to download files faster using Linux or Mac. 
1). Download aria2
Through brew: brew install aria2

Other systems: https://aria2.github.io/

Ubuntu Example:




2). cd to your downloads directory.
3). Run the following command:
aria2c --file-allocation=none -c -x 10 -s 10 $URL

4). Replace $URL with the download URL of the file you are trying to pull.
On the corporate network, downloading the docker for mac was taking upwards of an hour. 
Downloading with aria2c:

The download was much quicker due to multi-threaded downloads! 😄

With it, you can build efficient native, web, and mobile apps with a wide range of tools and libraries it integrates. However, there are still ways apps built with it can be improved. For example, using Angular Universal, you can render your apps server-side to speed up page loads and improve SEO and performance.
Server-side rendering involves converting an app to HTML on a server. When you send a request for a particular path to the server, it returns an entirely static HTML page as a response. No additional requests need to be made to populate the page with data and resources as it is all contained in the response. The page appears almost…]]></summary>

Cloud computing has seen a shift from traditional Java deployments to application servers like Tomcat to highly dynamic environments such as serverless and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
Many of the benefits of these new cloud platforms rely on their ability to quickly spin application instances up to meet additional demand and restart applications to adapt to infrastructure changes like operating system upgrades or virtual machine provisioning.
Deploying Java to these environments has been a challenge, though, largely due to the amount of time it takes even a basic Java web application to start, called the cold boot time. It is not uncommon to have to wait 30 seconds or more before your application can begin serving traffic, which becomes a problem on platforms that scale down to zero waiting for incoming traffic and expect to quickly launch an application to process a request.
Quarkus is a container native platform that addresses many of these performance issues, and in this blog post, we'll take a look at a simple Quarkus web application exposing a REST endpoint protected by Auth0.
Quarkus has been designed to address the needs of serverless and container environments by reducing startup times and memory consumption. Perhaps the most exciting thing about Quarkus is its tight integration with GraalVM to allow applications to be compiled into native binaries.
Quarkus integrates with a huge range of libraries, giving developers access to many familiar platforms and allowing for the migration of existing code bases. These libraries are selected or customized to run seamlessly on Quarkus and to be able to take advantage of native compilation.
Of course, authentication is a central requirement of any modern web application, and Quarkus has out of the box support for OAuth, which in turn can be integrated into Auth0.

To work around this, you are usually forced to use a .htaccess file or special server configuration to route all of your requests to the correct destinations. This issue makes hosting frontend framework applications cumbersome in a cloud storage scenario.

Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
