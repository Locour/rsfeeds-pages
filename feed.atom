Forgetting to delete unused images.
Building a lot of images that left previous versions as untagged.
Creating networks but not deleting them.
Forgetting to delete old volumes.
keeping alive containers that are not needed anymore.
Forgetting to delete stopped containers.
And the worst can be trying to delete all those resources one by one using
docker rm <container-id>
docker rm <image-id>
...

Specially if the amount of forgotten resources is high.
Another example can be found on running resources, if yo do not limit docker consumption, a container might take all the available memory assigned to docker and left oth…]]></summary>

There may be a time in your development career where you need to author a package that extends Python w/ C or C++. In such a case your Python package needs to go through a compilation process, which converts C or C++ to binaries that work for a specific target system. This becomes really tedious when you think about how many flavors and versions of Linux there are.  Building a separate binary for Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, etc... Ugh so tiring.
Why Python packaging can be easy w/ manylinux


Fortunately, there is a solution. manylinux was birthed to make it easy for your Python packages to be compatible with most Linux variants. manylinux takes advantage of the fact that most distributions are mindful of backwards compatibility, and intentionally builds bdist wheels on an old version of a distribution. The idea is that if we build on an old supported version, the binaries produced are compatible with current versions.
So what is a manylinux really? Is it a ham sandwich?


No. Even better. It's a Docker image. manylinux is a Docker image built off a certain old versions of the CentOS operating system that comes bundled with libraries that are assumed to be present by default on almost all Linux systems.
You can find an example of manylinux distributions within the pandas project. Here are two (out of many) from the list of available pandas downloads from PyPI:
pandas-1.0.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
pandas-1.0.3-cp37-cp37m-manylinux1_i686.whl

In this case, pandas has built manylinux wheels for CPython 3.7 supporting both x86-64 and i686 architectures. It's manylinux so this wheel should be compatible for many linux :)
Happy packaging!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Building electronic circuits can be difficult especially the bigger ones,as there is no printf to check if wire is properly connected. Being an electrical engineering ,I have tried to build tools that would help understand and design electronics faster and better. Chip.io 
But in this project I want something more complex😈, 
However, I don't discourage the possibility of using it to program integrated circuits🤔.
It's basically a nodejs project which utilizes nearley and Moo to parse the code which is then converted to a particular javascript format that simulates logic circuit.
All of this began while I was trying to disign a circuit in logisim and was not able to do in the way I wanted it to be. Also at that time i had already started messing out with lexer and parsers, which finally led to this project. 
Build an interpreter that can run the code
Multiple libraries that implements complex circuits.
A graphic interface which can generate the code by drag n drop ( Similar to logisim )
Ability to program integrated circuits ( sometimes 😜)
Let me show you a sample of the program
module HalfAdder([a,b]=>[s,c])
{
    init{
        [s] = [0];
        [c] = [0];
    }
    process {
        [s] = XOR([a,b]);
        [c] = AND([a,b]);
    }
}
HalfAdder Adder;

Input [A] = [0];
Input [B] = [0];
Output [S];
Output [C];

wire(A => Adder.a);
wire(B => Adder.b);
wire(Adder.s => S);
wire(Adder.c => C);


And this would produce a circuit like 

I don't want to go deep into the explanation but in simple terms we created a blue print for HalfAdder ,whose inputs are a and b, outputs are s and c. After which we instantiated a HalfAdder ( as Adder) which is connected to input ports A and B , Output Ports S and C
Any suggestions and feedbacks is greatly appreciated.
Thank you ❤️ for reading.]]></summary>

Some might disagree, but the overall opinion is that Kubernetes is not really developer friendly. Kubernetes has over 50 object types, complex RBAC and to get anything deployed, you'll need to write YAML manifest. But you also need to learn how to handle horizontal scaling, networking, secrets, ingress, and a hole lot more. The question is, why would a developer care about all this stuff. Developers don’t care about all the Kubernetes internals, they just like to get an HTTP(S) endpoint of their running application.

Have you ever had developer teams request ownership of a full subscription to be able to freely experiment?
You still want to keep isolation, segregate responsibilities and permissions.
Ability to experiment freely is paramount to innovation, but uncontrolled proliferation of subscriptions can bear a significant management overhead.
Can we have the best of both worlds? The short answer is: yes.
A resource group can be an effective boundary as it allows its contributors to yet create any resource, but also restrict the scope of access within a subscription.
You can also enforce tags and Azure policies to control costs and enforce security.
But now a team is restricted to creating resources within a single resource group and it c…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VS Code 🤯


VS Code seems to be the 1 size fit all code editor. VS Code offers really seamless integration to develop on a remote connection such as the WSL 2 with the simple installation of an extension.
If you don't have it already, install VS Code from the official site. 

(You can also download the insiders build if you like living on the bleeding edge)
While installing VS Code, make sure to check the Add to Path option.

All you need to do is install the Remote - WSL Extension

Start a WSL 2 remote session
Ctrl + Shift + P and type in new wsl window to open up a new WSL 2 window and select the option

A new WSL 2 window should open up from the directory you were using.

It is advised to use VS Code from the Linux file system instead of the windows'. To do this just use the Open Folder option from the File menu.
Just traverse to ~ or $HOME directory and then add the projects to the Linux file system and use them from there.

Upon opening any projects in WSL window, you will see the WSL 2.0  connection on the bottom-left as well as the title bar.

As we all know, there are two types of edges, directed and undirected edges. When traversing directed edges, you can traverse forward or reversely. Nebula Graph also supports this semantics. For example:
go from "101" over known reversely yield known.kdate, id($$);

The above statement starts from Vertex 101 to find all the corresponding neighbors reversely. However, when you insert an edge into Nebula Graph, the command will be like:
insert edge known(degree) VALUES "100" -> "101":(299792458);

Instead of manually calling the compiler and package manager as dotnet restore/dotnet build, you can automate this process, especially if you are working with multiple solutions/projects that depend on each other and require certain steps to be built.

Rather, it provides many features and rich tools that help with:
Cleanup
Restore packages and dependencies
Compilation
Test automation
Post-build processing
Generating production builds
Packaging, creating Docker images, etc.

Here's what I ran to get it working
This part is the same:
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \

Add their GPG Key (same from site):
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

[Different] Remove previous entry (this was added when the first install failed, you may have done the same)
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list

This is a common case - especially in schools that are introducing physical computing to CS students.

OAuth 2 Core does not say what an access token (AT) should look like, only what it should be used for. Left to their own devices, the most important OAuth-based services and products chose to encode access tokens as JWTs. Without guidance from standards, however, they ended up producing as many incompatible variants.

This article is the story of how this issue bugged me so much that I took it on myself to work with the IETF standards community to try fixing it, culminating in the publication of a new standard document describing how to encode and validate an OAuth 2.0 AT in JWT format.

I am taking this opportunity to give you a glimpse of how the standardization process works, but most importantly: I hope …]]></summary>

Containers are as crucial as the code they support. In this tutorial, we’ll introduce a different way of testing them before deployment.

You can consider a 'classic' way of passing data, is passing data through a JSON list or Database.
This often causes having to re-deconstruct the State in each new child component. 
To avoid this you can use the useContext hook in React, and pass it's props through a ContextProvider very easily.
This article will show you how to pass data from one central useContext that provides it's props to all components.

In that position, the first obvious advantage is that it can perform as an edge service, concentrating connections from one network, and proxy the requests to the database in a non-exposed network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ReactJS:
React (ReactJS, React.js) is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces that are open-source. Facebook created, developed, and supports this useful tool, which can be downloaded from their Github page. Facebook updates and creates new guides for this collection on a regular basis.
Advantages of ReactJS:
ReactJs has a lot of experience with SEO. While other Javascript does not allow SEO, you can easily run your ReactJS with the servers.
Disadvantages of ReactJS:
React technologies are evolving and developing at such a rapid pace that there is no time to properly document them. To get around this, developers write their own instructions when new versions and tools in their present projects evolve.
AngularJS:
AngularJS is a framework for building dynamic web applications. It allows you to utilize HTML as your template language and enhance HTML's syntax to represent the components of your application clearly and succinctly. Data binding and dependency injection in AngularJS eliminate a lot of the code you'd have to write otherwise. And because it all happens in the browser, it's a great companion for any server technology.
Advantages of AngularJS:
Because Angularjs is an open-source JavaScript MVC framework, anyone can create a custom application at a low cost.
Disadvantages of AngualrJS:
In Angular, there is no server authorization or authentication. Authorization is the process of granting data access authorization and identifying a user by validating credentials. Because AngularJs is unable to fulfill both functionalities, we refer to it as "less secure."
AngularJs is totally dependent on JavaScript. If these scripts are hidden, the resulting pages appear to be rudimentary.
It's huge and complicated. There are numerous ways to execute the same operation in angular, making it impossible to determine which method is the most efficient.
AngularJs is not supported by Internet Explorer 8.0.]]></summary>

Store Tips


Put global state in a single place
Don't put the local state in the global store
Use selectors for the derived state
Use view model selectors
Treat actions as unique events
Group actions by source
Don't dispatch actions conditionally
Create reusable reducers
Be careful with facades

Name effects like functions
Keep effects simple
Don't create "boiler" effects
Apply single responsibility principle
Apply good action hygiene

The official definition of this life-cycle hook goes like this:
"Detect and act upon changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own. Called immediately after ngOnChanges() on every change detection run, and immediately after ngOnInit() on the first run."
Simply put, Angular tracks binding inputs by object reference. It means that if an object reference hasn’t changed, the binding change is not detected and change detection is not executed. This is where we need ngDoCheck.

This blog covers how to install lw-scanner and leverage it to perform image assurance scans from within VS Code.
Install lw-scanner
support.lacework.com and the the latest release of the scanner binary can be found at github.com
Once lw-scanner is installed the next step is to download the Lacework plugin from the VS Code Marketplace.

With an active Dockerfile in the editor you can initiate an image assurance scan by clicking Command+Shift+P on macOS (Control+Shift+P on Windows/Linux).

Once the scan is complete you will see a summary next to the base image that will disappear along with a more detailed scan result available in the output window.

Source code can be found here for now: github.
This is just a quick preview update. For suggestions or feedback please open an issue on the repo. PRs welcomed. Stay tuned for more.

Rate limiting is a simple way of stopping users (hopefully just the bad ones!) from accessing more of your sites resources than you would like.
I will show you a simple way to rate limit specific URLs by using Nginx.
The written instructions are below, but here is a quick video walkthrough showing how to apply rate limiting in Nginx.





  
  
  How to add rate limiting in nginx


At the top of you nginx file, you can define a map like so:
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr_map zone=mylimit:10m rate=5r/s;
limit_req_status 429;

map $request_uri $binary_remote_addr_map {
    default "";
    ~^/what-is-new.html $binary_remote_addr;
    ~^/another-url-to-rate-limit.html $binary_remote_addr;
}

Then within your location block, add:
limit_req zone=mylimit;

And that's it! Now only webpages matching the $request_uri will have rate limiting applied. This is handy when you have all of your request being routed through a single place, but you only want to have specific pages on your site rate limited.]]></summary>

These sorts of vulnerabilities have an impact on software supply chains; for example, if an attacker successfully commits code injection by deceiving human reviewers, future software is likely to inherit the vulnerability.
But let's look at the technique:
Extended strings: make sections of string literals seem as code, having the same impact as comments and causing string comparison to fail.


Comment out: forces a comment to appear as code, which is then ignored.


Early returns: bypass a function by running a return statement that seems to be inside a comment.
