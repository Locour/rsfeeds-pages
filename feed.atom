Lack of data quality can lead to wasted marketing efforts, lost revenue, and customer frustration.
Data Quality Assessments are the answer! With this tool, you'll be able to identify potential problems with your data before they become an issue. This will save you time and money in the long run by avoiding costly mistakes that could have been avoided if caught early enough. You can also use these assessments to improve your current processes so that there's less chance of errors happening in the future.
In this article, I've explained the six dimensions of data quality and the data quality assessment process.

Throughout our documentation, to explain how to use different features we must reference grid methods and properties and their interfaces. This meant we had hardcoded many Interface definitions into our documentation so that these could be read.

Instead of explaining the difference between dotenv and typed-dotenv, let's feel it by seeing how we write my-api-client.js differently.

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
It's one of the must-have libraries which I install in nearly all of my projects, until I published typed-dotenv last year.
Instead of explaining the difference between dotenv and typed-dotenv, let's feel it by seeing how we write my-api-client.js differently.
/* my-api-client.js */

const { config } = require('dotenv');
const HttpClient = require('./http-client');

config();

const required = ['MY_API_HOST', 'MY_API_KEY'];

"Let’s use a token to secure this API call. Should I use the ID token or the access token? ​🤔 The ID token looks nicer to me. After all, if I know who the user is, I can make better authorization decisions, right?"
Have you ever found yourself making similar arguments? Choices based on your intuition may sound good, but what looks intuitive is not always correct. In the case of ID and access tokens, they have clear and well-defined purposes, so you should use them based on that. Using the wrong token can result in your solution being insecure.
"What changes after all? They are just tokens. I can use them as I see fit. What’s the worst that could happen?"
Let’s take a closer look at these two types of tokens to better understand their role in authentication and authorization processes.
An ID token is an artifact that proves that the user has been authenticated. It was introduced by OpenID Connect (OIDC), an open standard for authentication used by many identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and, of course, Auth0. Check out this document for more details on OpenID Connect. Let's take a quick look at the problem OIDC wants to resolve.
Consider the following diagram:

Here, a user with their browser authenticates against an OpenID provider and gets access to a web application. The result of that authentication process based on OpenID Connect is the ID token, which is passed to the application as proof that the user has been authenticated.
This provides a very basic idea of what an ID token is: proof of the user's authentication. Let’s see some other details.
An ID token is encoded as a JSON Web Token (JWT), a standard format that allows your application to easily inspect its content, and make sure it comes from the expected issuer and that no one else changed it. If you want to learn more about JWTs, check out The JWT Handbook.

Much of the Node.js kernel is built around an idiomatic event-driven asynchronous architecture in which certain types of objects (called "emitters") emit events that cause a "listeners" function call.
The following example shows a simple EventEmitter with a single "listener" that occurs when, for example, a sale is made

Instead of trying to solve the problems of too many failing, complex and costly abstractions by adding even more complexity and bloat, let's try to move into the opposite direction.
In his article from 1975, How do we tell truths that might hurt?, Edsger W. Dijkstra said "Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability". These words are now more important than ever.

Authentication
It is recommended to use an IdP server as a provider for user authentication to the Kubernetes API (for example, using OIDC) Cluster administrators are advised not to use service account tokens for authentication.
It is recommended to use a centralized certificate management service to manage certificates within the cluster (for user and service purposes)
User accounts should be personalized. The names of the service accounts should reflect the purpose access rights of the accounts.
Authorization
For each cluster, a role-based access model should be developed.

So you know about bash and zsh and how they work right? The fish shell is not like those shells. I mean they kinda have similarities but they do differ very much. ZSH can execute bash commands in a native as bash does but fish shell requires some editing to it specially when it comes to setting variables and exporting paths.

I usually work on the terminals only and for that I frequent switch between different directories, editing them in vim (I use neovim), etc. So for me having a built-in autocompletion for shell with syntax highlighting and is a plus point.

  A Yummy Analogy


Imagine you have ordered your favorite pizza of large size. You see, the pizza is divided into 8 slices. Assuming you are kind enough to share the pizza with 3 of your friends, each of you gets 2 slices each. Now let’s observe the following:
Cost savings: You can buy one whole pizza, and share it among 4 people
Isolation: What you do with your slice of pizza has no effect whatsoever on your friend’s slice.
Efficient pizza sharing: If one of your friends wants to eat 3 slices, and another one just wants one, it can be done.
Compare it with buying a large pizza that you are not able to eat all by yourself and 5 pieces of it going to waste, or a plate of dessert that you have to share with…]]></summary>

TypeScript - const assertion can prevent literal types from being treated as more general types, e.g. const config = {light: "ON"} as const; will have light as the literal type "ON" instead of string, making it compatible with type {light: "ON" | "OFF"}. It'll also make light readonly. More explanation can be found on the official documentation page. 


JWT - it can be signed asymmetrically with a key pair or symmetrically with a shared secret. The latter means all parties involved use one secret for both signing and signature verification, which means any party with the shared secret could have signed the JWS - something to be taken into consideration during implementation.


Design & storytelling - good stories are engaging and help build empathy, adapting them to your audience and backing up the points with data could be helpful in getting buy-in during a design process. NN/g has an article on 6  rules for persuasive storytelling.

Date has been a long-standing pain point in ECMAScript. Temporal, is  a global Object that acts as a top-level namespace (like Math), that brings a modern date/time API to the ECMAScript language. 
Date, and the motivations for Temporal, see: Fixing JavaScript Date.
Temporal fixes these problems by:
  Providing easy-to-use APIs for date and time computations
  First-class support for all time zones, including DST-safe arithmetic
  Dealing only with objects representing fixed dates and times
  Parsing a strictly specified string format
  Supporting non-Gregorian calendars
Object Relationship

Code examples
Temporal.Now
Temporal.Now.instant() - get the exact time since Unix epoch
Temporal.Now.timeZone() - get the current system time zone
Temporal.Instant
const instant = Temporal.Instant.from('1969-07-20T20:17Z');
instant.toString();  // => '1969-07-20T20:17:00Z'
instant.epochMilliseconds;  // => -14182980000

Temporal.PlainDate
const date = Temporal.PlainDate.from({ year:  2006, month:  8, day:  24  });  // => 2006-08-24 
date.year;  // => 2006 
date.inLeapYear;  // => false 
date.toString();  // => '2006-08-24'

Back in the days, when creating an AWS account was a lot of overhead, common pattern was to have multiple teams sharing a single account. This created a demand to isolate teams from each other by assigning them an IAM policy that would grant access only to their part of the account. While it might have been possible (in theory) to create complex IAM policies to containerize resources by application or team, one fundamental problem did remain. Once you granted a right to create an IAM policy or role, you effectively granted admin level access to everything on the account. IAM has very granular …]]></summary>

AWK is a command-line programming language primarily oriented to text and files processing - some might call it a tool -, simple yet elegant continuous lines of code can replace multiple lines of a more robust language like java or node without losing their intention.
In essence, AWK code is so simple that you can just throw it away after the execution or once your program has finished its work.
% awk 'BEGIN { print "Hello World" }'
Hello World

But there is so much more than that; considering the constant need to process data files, once you have started with AWK, you will stop building complete programs to process CSV or log files for faster and more straightforward with a couple of instructions

After weeks of exams and dealing with imposter syndrome, I am back with another short article on 'file commands' in Linux. These are pretty useful so take a look. 🤠
The 'cd' command moves you into any directory you want. For example, if I have files located in the 'Documents' directory, this is the command I would run:
cd Documents
and this would move me to that directory.

The 'ls' command lists everything that is in that directory. To list everything in the directory, run this command:
ls -l

the 'cat' commands displays what is inside a file. Simply run this command:
cat (name of file)

The cat command also can do other things. 👇
Using this command, you can also create a file.

the class of model for creating instances

Every component started with its own markdown file to document the design.
We put down the ideal developer usage and experience, for the component.
We referenced our existing version, component tickets history and industry leaders.

Once satisfied, we sought feedback from the rest of the dev team.

The problem is, most of us don't know what makes a good password and aren't able to remember hundreds of them anyway.

One of the very first challenges I faced was making sure I can connect to the internet using my D-Link DWM-157 modem.
After doing some google search I came to know about ‘Modem Manager GUI’ and I was so happy. Opened my terminal and simply typed:
sudo apt-get update


Someone was smiling behind the scene and was whispering not so easy boy! Prepare for the next hurdle.
I was so happy it is a very nice GUI, everything is here for me i just a single click away to check anything. Everything was working perfectly in the GUI except the USSD code !

A full-fledged Docker installation on WSL2
Docker Daemon automatic start without any crazy hacks
Docker Daemon sharing between Windows and WSL (i.e. you cannot run docker from Windows PowerShell)
Docker Daemon sharing between WSL distributions
I will consider that you already have WSL2 working, and you are using Ubuntu as your distribution.

All modern motherboards come equipped with an integrated RAID controller, and top models may have several such controllers on board. That’s a different question, though, if such integrated controllers in consumer-class motherboards are ever used by an average user. Anyway, some motherboards do give a chance to setup a RAID array right inside your home PC.
Below are brief recommendations on building a RAID array on a home computer and a practical tutorial on assembling a PC for RAID.

awk is a powerfull command line tool found included in all modern GNU/linux distributions. It is often excluded from beginner level Linux tutorials, where more fundamental commands like cd , pwd, ls etc are given more priority, and rightfully so. One must have a good grasp on the basic commmand line tools in order  to harness the full power of awk. 
awk in essence is a pattern scanning and processing language, emphasis on the language part because awk possesses functionality akin to most mainstream programming languages. 
awk loves tabulated data. So to begin with, you'll need a piece of text represented as columns delimited by some common character. You see this pattern often in shells, for instance, the ls -l command that prints file information delimited by a space :
