        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Examples taken from howtographql)
Welcome to the second part of Learn GraphQL With Me. In this post we will be learning about some core concepts related to GraphQL. These concepts are language independent, so it means that you do not need to know any particular language to understand these, as these are GraphQL specific, and once understood can be implemented in any language.
One thing to keep in mind here is that as GraphQL is different from REST and SOAP, you need to try to understand this little differently as GraphQL has its own specific concepts, which are independent of any other type of API.
So let's finally begin learning GraphQL.
GraphQL has its own type system for defining schemas, like we do for modelling the database tables (for SQL) and documents (for NoSQL). This is called the SDL or the Schema Definition Language. 
So this is how you define schemas or types in GraphQL:
type Person {
    name: String!
    age: Int!
}

Notice how we have ! after the data types String and Int. This tells that 'name' and 'age' are compulsory. If we just wrote name as name: String, this would have meant that it is not compulsory that Person has a name.
Let's also add a Post type to our schema:
type Post {
    title: String!
}

Now what if we want to have relations between the Post and the Person type. We can now use Person and Post as a data type, like we use String, Int. So let's define an author field, which is of type Person.
type Post {
    title: String!
    author: Person!
}

This tells that a Post will have an author who will be a Person. But we also want to say that a Person can write many posts, so how do we do that. Let's add a posts field to Person type which will be an array of type Post.
type Person {
    name: String!
    age: Int!
    posts: [Post!]!
}

Notice how we have ! after Post as well as after ], this tells that the array is compulsory as well as there has to be some data of type Post inside it.]]></summary>

In the case of bioinformatics tools, this is notoriously difficult in some cases, particularly in Linux-based operating systems such as Ubuntu, where one-click installer files, unlike Windows, are not an option. Although much of the popular software in the bioinformatics world is easy to install in Ubuntu if one is familiar with the ecosystem, a beginner will certainly have a difficult time circling the internet trying to find a proper installation method, at least, that‚Äôs what I had to go through when I first started out.
Here in this article, I compiled out the installation methods of some of the most commonly used bioinformatics and simulation tools, as well as how to run these tools after installing them on an Ubuntu 20.04 machine. Feel free to let me know which software should be added next.

In lay mans language i would define docker as a platform that enables you build once and deploy everywhere.Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure, therefore you wont have to set up all the dependencies your apps need all over again and again as you migrate between different environments
Before proceeding further it is important to highlight some important concepts that you will commonly hear of in the docker world .This are:
A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software .For example we have a mysql image which includes everything needed to run mysql: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings
The hub is a repository where container images are stored. You can get public images as well as store your own private images.
Docker Container is a layer of images .

Docker images become containers when they run on Docker Engine.

Docker Engine is the runtime environment for all containers. Docker engine can be used in both linux and windows based infrastructure. A docker application can easily be run in any environment as long as there is a docker engine.
This solves the ‚Äúdependency hell‚Äù for developers and operations teams, and eliminating the ‚Äúit works on my laptop!‚Äù problem.

Before understanding the difference between Docker and Virtual machines its important to understand Operating systems. Operating systems have an application and kernel layer

Docker virtualizes the application layer and use the kernel of the host while a virtual machines virtualizes both application & kernel layer.
Docker size is small a couple of megabytes while a virtual machine size is large a couple of gigabytes .
Docker is faster while a virtual machines size is slower.]]></summary>

My first exposure to Linux was in a virtual machine and it was OpenSUSE. Which I remember very little about now, except that I thought it was quite fun. I mostly just looked at it a bit, but I liked it.
When Netbooks came out, you could get a 9 inch one with Linux on it. I don't remember which distro was on it, but it wasn't a common one. I don't think it said when it was sold, I googled to find out. It was more of a useful little computer to have on your lap on the sofa for odd little bits, so the OS didn't make a great deal of difference. But the computer not being very powerful meant Linux was better on it than Windows.

Express middlewares are the functions that have access to the request, response and next function in applications request response cycle. The next function calls the next middleware that is succeding the current middleware.
Let's simplify the above statement a bit. So a express middleware is basically a function that has req,res and next as a parameters. For example,
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

function logger(req, res, next) {
  console.log("I am a middleware and I log the text");
  next();
}
app.use(logger)
app.get('/', (req,res)=>{
 res.send("Hellow World!!")
})
app.listen(3000)

As you may have known that Heroku does not allow your app to run for more than 1 hour. When an app on Heroku has only one web dyno and that dyno doesn't receive any traffic in 1 hour, the dyno goes to sleep.
When someone accesses the app, the dyno manager automatically wakes up the web dyno to run the web process type. This causes a short delay for this first request, but subsequent requests perform normally.
So now how can we run it forever without sleep? so that web process or API request doesn't have any kind of delay.

Firstly you need to have a Heroku app which can be a new or old one. if you don't have a Heroku app Click Here

AWS App Runner is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to quickly deploy containerized web applications and APIs at scale and with no prior infrastructure experience required. Start with your source code or a container image. App Runner automatically builds and deploys the web application, and load balances traffic with encryption. App Runner also scales up or down automatically to meet your traffic needs. With App Runner, you have more time to focus on your applications rather than thinking about servers or scaling. 

The features of App Runner are

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I've recently created an Elasticsearch Typescript template so you can get started using TS & Elasticsearch. 
Elasticsearch is a open-source search engine built on Apache Lucene and developed in Java. Elasticsearch allows you to store & search huge volumes of data very quickly in near real-time and give back responses in milliseconds. Yes you heard that right milliseconds... It's able to achieve these fast search speeds/responses because instead of searching the text directly, it searches through an index. It uses a structure based on documents instead of tables and schemas.
I created this template because I haven't seen many templates for Elasticsearch & Typescript and even tutorials covering this so I decided to create one to make peoples lives easier.
You can get started here!, Just follow the README on how to setup your environment variables, and setting up the server.
‚≠ês are much appreciated! :)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we use Angular's schematics to generate components, unnecessary asynchronous code is added to the test setup hook for its test suite.
The following test setup is generated by Angular's component generation schematic:
beforeEach(async () => {
  await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  }).compileComponents();
});

component schematic.





Alternatively, we might be using Angular's waitForAsync test function wrapper (formerly named async) as seen in the following code snippet:
beforeEach(waitForAsync(() => {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  }).compileComponents();
}));

waitForAsync.





Here's the deal: It's only necessary to call the static TestBed.compileComponents method if we're not using the Angular CLI to run our tests (who would do such a thing, Google? üëàüòè).
The Angular CLI compiles our application and tests before the tests are run so no asynchronous action is needed for setting up the declarables.
Let's simplify the common test setup by leaving out async-await, waitForAsync, and even the TestBed.createComponent invocation as seen in this code snippet:
beforeEach(() => {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [MyComponent],
  });
});

The following points are true for common Angular testbed setup for tests covering all types of Angular declarables:
No need to use async-await
No need to use waitForAsync (formerly named async)
No need to call TestBed.compileComponents



Of course, there might be other reasons for introducing asynchronicity to our test setup but compiling and linking declarables is not one of them.
Enjoy a little less boilerplate in your Angular tests üåû]]></summary>

Simply, I want that very ancient one to one messaging based on logged users (not bound to any SMTP servers or APIs, even If I use users oAuth and I have emails).
Whatever keywords I search with, I find sockets and real-time messaging everywhere. No one mentions internal and private users messaging nowhere. Unbelievable üò°.
You could suggest any real-time many-to-many solution and assume theoretically we can limit messaging to one-to-one, private, but no, 
The only scenario possible: A user is interested in one listing, he/she sends a message to the author of the thread, then they can chat about that in a small time window (2 days or something). This is important as I don't want my site to be a chatting platform.
So to sum up, I'm looking for an open-source NodeJS solution even some part of a NodeJS project that I can pick. Ready made to not reinvent the wheel, and because I'm tired of this project ;(
Many thanks !!!! and no open source solutions like Slack üò°üò° you now know why üòÇ

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finally, I've got my 4th pull request merged. 
I was looking some good issues in repos that I have starred and I found the issue Update CreateEvent to deal with repository creation. 
This is the live feed of the website and it failed to display the message whenever someone would create a new repo in the organization. 

Let's take a look at how the front-end component deals with the REST endpoint
    case 'CreateEvent':
    case 'DeleteEvent': {
      const target = payload?.ref;
      const targetType = payload?.ref_type;
      const action = type === 'CreateEvent'? 'created' : 'deleted';
      if (!targetType || !target) {
        return unknown;
      }
      return <span>{action} {targetType} <code>{target}</code> in</span>;
    }

and the data returned by the api
{
    "id": "18549674018",
    "type": "CreateEvent",
    "actor": {
      "id": 65370631,
      "login": "matthewcn56",
      "display_login": "matthewcn56",
      "gravatar_id": "",
      "url": "https://api.github.com/users/matthewcn56",
      "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65370631?"
    },
    "repo": {
      "id": 419984626,
      "name": "uclaacm/status-check",
      "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/uclaacm/status-check"
    },
    "payload": {
      "ref": null,
      "ref_type": "repository",
      "master_branch": "main",
      "description": "Check the health/status of ACM's various websites/deployments!",
      "pusher_type": "user"
    },

Since ref is null when a user creates a new repo, the code returns the default message unknown. Therefore, adding a condition should fix it.
      if (!target) {
        return <span>{action} the {targetType} </span>;
      }
      if (!targetType) {
        return unknown;
      }

Though the issue wasn't hard to solve, I found it more valuable getting to know the project's workflow. I got to learn about husky, pre-commit hooks and how to make sure code linting has no error before passing the PR tests as well as GitHub API.]]></summary>

The Raspberry Pi 4 offers an excellent upgrade to the preceding Pi 3B+, but keeping the new model from overheating can be a challenge. Users have tried many techniques to tackle this issue, from running the Pi in the open air to utilizing cooling rigs with fans attached. But as vertical cases are gaining popularity, can my DIY vertical case keep the Broadcom BCM2711B0 quad-core A72 SOC (system on chip)‚Äîcool? Spoiler alert: Surprisingly, yes.
First of all, why subject your Raspberry Pi to this level of stress? In the case of Raspberry Pi 4, the A72 CPU is so powerful that it can overheat if it doesn't have enough cooling. This results in the CPU being thermal throttled (governed) to reduce the power consumption and in turn reducing heat generation. The ‚Ä¶]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A private bug bounty program I am on had a scope increase recently.
*target.com

amass does not seem to have a feature that handles this sort of search, so I generated that list in bash/zsh:
for i in $(cat mylist.txt); do 
    echo $itarget.com >> potential-targets; 
done

This is for only one target. If your list containing multiple targets is in targets.txt, do:
for i in $(cat targets.txt); do 
    for j in $(cat mylist.txt); do
        echo $j$i >> potential-targets.txt; 
    done
done

This can yield a big file. To compress it after creation:
gzip -9 potential-targets.txt

To zip them during creation:
for i in $(cat targets.txt); do 
    for j in $(cat mylist.txt); do
        echo $j$i | gzip -9 >> potential-targets.txt.gz; 
    done
done

Once you've created the list of targets and zipped them, lets say we want to find all of the potentials yielding actual pages with content. Fire up httpx:
zcat potential-targets.txt.gz | \
httpx -no-fallback -o httpx.txt

Because this can take a long time, you might consider lowering the timeout, or using more or less threads:
zcat potential-targets.txt.gz | \
httpx -no-fallback -o httpx.txt -threads 200 -timeout 1

Lets say you didn't zip potential-targets. That's ok. httpx has an option to read directly from file. Everyone online is so obsessed with piping output because they think it is cool, but encouraging people to merely copy/paste data results in bad thinking and approach.
httpx -l potential-targets.txt -no-fallback \
-o httpx.txt -threads 200 -timeout 1

This will run for a long time. I was running it with default timeout and 8 threads on 300,000+ possible names and it had not completed after several hours. I'm running it now on a much larger namespace and even though it is taking a long time, I am already yielding new names that did not show up in amass.

Security best practices and technologies change, so refreshing your understanding and keeping up with current best practices is a good thing. Here are some notes I took while I reviewed my knowledge and applied my experience implementing auth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most powerful features when creating Angular components is the Async Pipe. The greatest thing about it is that it allows you to take advantage of asynchronous rendering in your templates, but without having to worry about subscribing and unsubscribing from Observables.
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';
import { of, Subject } from 'rxjs';
import { delay, startWith, takeUntil } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <h1>Async example</h1> 
    <h2>Items</h2> 
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let item of items | async">{{item}}</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Other Items</h2> 
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let other of otherItems">{{other}}</li>
    </ul>
  `,
  styleUrls: [ './app.component.css' ]
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy  {

  items = of([1, 2, 3])
    .pipe(
      delay(2000), 
      startWith(['...'])
    );

  // vs 

  otherItems: any[];
  private destroy$ = new Subject();
  ngOnInit() {
    of([1, 2, 3])
      .pipe(
        delay(2000),
        startWith(['...']),
        takeUntil(this.destroy$)
      )
      .subscribe(other  => this.otherItems = other)
  }
  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.destroy$.next();
    this.destroy$.complete();
  }
}


Check it out on Stackblitz.
As you can see, in the first example, we are rendering a list (items) using the async pipe in the HTML template. There is no need for the additional handling after the component is destroyed, which you can see is not the case for the other list otherItems.   That is simply because the async pipe is going to take care of that for you.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many people are concerned about how much personal information is stored on the internet and could be stolen or misused in today's reality. You're not the only one who feels this way. The issue of online privacy is crucial.
You can improve your online security against unwanted access to your data and privacy by taking several simple actions.
1 
Browse in private mode or use a browser, which doesn't store and send your data.
Browsing in private mode can let you avoid your browser's history from tracing. However, these private modes aren't entirely private. Your ISP can observe your surfing behavior even if you're using an incognito or private mode.
e.g.
https://www.brave.com/
https://www.beakerbrowser.com/
2 
Be cautious about where you click.
Phishing attempts are one of the ways how hackers can compromise your online privacy. They frequently accomplish this by sending fake emails that look like from banks, credit card companies, etc. 
3 
Change your search engine.
If you're like most web users, you use Google as your primary search engine.
e.g.
https://www.duckduckgo.com/
https://www.startpage.com/
4
Use dedicated proxy servers. 
A dedicated proxy server acts as a private and secure connection point between users and the internet. It's a server that acts as an "intermediary" between end-users and the web pages they browse on the internet. An IP address is used when a computer connects to the internet.
You can compare it to your home's street address. It directs data to the appropriate destination while also providing a return address for other devices.
A dedicated proxy server is a machine connected to the internet that has its unique IP address and serves as a disguise for your computer.
There are plenty of companies that provide such services, here is my personal top of the most reliable ones:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we know multiple components share the common data and always need updated shared data. In such scenarios most of the time BehaviorSubject is used which acts as a single store to hold updated shared data.
BehaviorSubject is both observer and type of observable.
BehaviorSubject always need an initial/default value.
Every observer on subscribe gets current value.
Current value is either latest value emitted by source observable using next() method or initial/default value.
Let‚Äôs implement BehaviorSubject to understand a concept better!
For e.g In order tracking app, display total items in cart and total items in wish list on UI in header and dashboard section based on user action.
Now we have three components -

Run Live
When user add items in the cart/wishList, total count needs to be updated in the header and dashboard component.
1.First create a BehaviorSubject in order service which holds the initial state of order count ,so that it can be used by any component.




3.When a user performs any action, call the next() method of BehaviorSubject. When the next() method gets called it will update current count with new count and notifies updated count to all observers(3 Components) who subscribed to source observable.

This way BehaviorSubject makes components communication more effective.

Currently, this script can perform a good variety of tasks such as ifconfig, ping, traceroute, port scans (including SYN, TCP, UDP, ACK, comprehensive scan, host discovery (scan for up devices on a local network), MAC address detection (get MAC address of a host IP on a local network), banner grabbing, DNS checks (with geolocation information), WHOIS, subdomain enumeration, vulnerability reconnaissance, packet sniffing, MAC spoofing, IP spoofing, SYN flooding, deauth attack and brute-force attack (beta).
Other features are still being implemented. Future implementations may include WAF detection, DNS enumeration, traffic analysis, XSS vulnerability scanner, ARP cache poisoning, DNS cache poisoning, MAC flooding, ping of death, network disassociation attack (not deauth attack), OSINT, exploits, some automated tasks and others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


The security alarm system will use a bipolar junction transistor switch to detect security problems. Theft attempt and other security threats can be controlled by using this simple circuit.
For the purpose of this application, we will design a security system for one room in a house. The sensor used for each opening can be either a mechanical switch, a magnetically operated switch, or an optical sensor. Detection of an intrusion can be used to initiate an audible alarm signal. 
We will be using a mechanical switch as our sensor and use a transistor as a NOT gate, so that when there is an open switch in our room a transistor will show a signal that an intruder has entered.
Resistor
Transistor
Buzzer
Voltage source

Room sensor is normally in a closed position and it is connected to a DC voltage source. When a door is open it creates an open circuit.


Transistor switches are used for high power devices such as
The areas of operation for Transistor switch are known as the Saturation Region and the Cut-Off Region.
Cut-off Region: here there is a large depletion layer


Saturation Region: here the depletion layer is as




  
  
  NOT Gate Transistor


A NOT gate simply inverts its input. If the input is high, the output is low, and if the input is low, the output is high

The operation of this circuit is simple. The input is connected through resistor R2 to the transistor‚Äôs
When voltage is present at the input, the transistor turns on, allowing current to flow through the collector-emitter circuit directly to ground. This ground path creates a shortcut that bypasses the output, which causes the output to go low.
We run our simulation with a voltmeter connected to the output, in place of the buzzer .

In the normal state, the switch will be closed.

When intrusion happens, the switch will open and the alarm (buzzer) will go off.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the ‚ÄúLeveraging Salesforce Using Spring Boot‚Äù article, I navigated the course for introducing a Spring Boot service that would leverage the well-established Salesforce RESTful API. The goal of this service was to act as a middleware layer; that way, clients not written in Salesforce could retrieve and update contact data stored in Salesforce. This backend service implemented its own caching layer to provide a faster response time and also cut down on the number of times Salesforce needed to be called.
In ‚ÄúLeveraging Salesforce Using a Client Written In Svelte,‚Äù I introduced a simple client written in Svelte, which made it possible to update the Salesforce data using an inline editor‚Äîagain, without actually using the Salesforce client.

Ubuntu 21.10 can load on my computer through secure boot, and the shim version is 15.4. Then refer to the official tutorial, I installed rEFInd v0.13.2 (the latest version when I posted this blog) via PPA in Ubuntu 21.10. However, when I restart the system and load rEFInd, it always fails with the message Verification failed:(0x1A)Security Violation. I'm sure that both refind_local.cer and refind.cer under the EFI/refind/keys/ have been enrolled through MokManager (Although only refind_local.cer is needed through PPA installation).
From this post, I got that rEFInd currently (v0.13.2) lacks the .sbat section. For shim 15.3 and later versions, SBAT is mandatory, resulting in failure to start rEFInd.

First of all, it increases security and helps you ease out the management of encryption keys. But it's also a highly recommended pattern by PCI-DSS (Security Standard for Credit Card Processing) and results in much stronger data privacy and data protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). 
When we think of data there are 3 places we can think of encrypting data:
At Rest - On hardware storage devices like on a disk or in your devices 
In Transit - In moving data between different locations like server to server through API calls
In Use - While it's being used by a server (New concept and still being researched)
