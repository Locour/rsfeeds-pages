        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On this post we discuss the necessary IaC (Infrastructure as Code) files to provision an EKS cluster capable of sharing a single GPU between multiple pods (code available here).
If you ever tried to use GPU-based instances with AWS ECS, or on EKS using the default Nvidia plugin, you would know that it's not possible to make a task/pod shared the same GPU on an instance. If you want to add more replicas to your service (for redundancy or load balancing), you would need one GPU for each replica.
And this doesn't seem to be going to change in the near future for ECS (see this feature request)
GPU-based instances are expensive, and despite the fact that some Machine Learning frameworks (e.g. Tensorflow) are pre-configured to use the entire GPU by default, that's not always the case. ML service…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post illustrates deployment process of Server Side Rendered Angular application, as can be guessed from the title.
Though, AWS has a dedicated service for deploying SSR applications, called  AWS Amplify, but, as of writing this post, Angular Universal is not supported by Amplify. There are multiple other options available to achieve the required result. One of the more popular ones were the usage of a third party API, called Serverless. But, It was particularly challenging for me to find a clean and vanilla solution as I was juggling between different options.
Below, I will demonstrate the usage of AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy Angular SSR.     
Open AWS Management Console and go to Elastic Beanstalk homepage. Click on Create Application.

Next, Give your application a name, and select Platform and Platform branch as illustrated below.

On the same page, proceed with uploading the zipped dist folder of your Angular app which gets generated upon building your app in the local system. Now, click on Configure more options button. 

On the next screen, click on the Edit button on the software tile.
  
Provide the Node Command considering dist as root. The path used in Node Command generally is of the folder where file to be run is placed.

Save the Configuration and click on Create App subsequently. Environment setup will take a few minutes, after which it will provide the Health status, logs and Deployment URL, as, can be seen below.

Despite most organizations' desire to be "data-driven", much of the quality storytelling we do remains anecdotal and story driven.
On the one hand, quantifying abstract concepts like "maturity", "quality", or "maintainability" is problematic. On the other hand, quantifiable metrics like "time-to-hello-world" and "uptime percentile" don't describe the health of an API ecosystem or whether improvement efforts are improving the speed and safety of overall API development.
I joined Postman in April, just as the company was preparing its latest survey. I saw it as an opportunity to build upon existing industry devops insights by testing whether they also apply to API program performance.
In the 180th Net #API Notes, I deep dive on the Postman 2021 State of the APIs Report; specifically, what are the four behaviors of high-performing API teams? And how do we measure them?

Role-Based Access Control, also known as RBAC, is one of the most common strategies to restrict access to protected resources within an organization. It simplifies permission assignment by categorizing users in roles. However, many people making their first foray into RBAC have questions:
How can you reflect this user categorization on your application to check users' privileges?
How can you deal with roles in your code?
Is role control appropriate for Web APIs?

We are proud to announce that Auth0, a product unit within Okta, has been recognized as a Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management, Worldwide. Gartner defines the Access Management market as: "The access management (AM) market is defined by customers’ needs to establish, enforce, and manage run-time access controls for internal and external types of identities, as well as machine identities, interacting with cloud, modern standards-based web and legacy web applications" Auth0 focuses on SaaS-delivered developer-centric and Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) use cases.
For more information, please download the full 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management report.

The Magic Quadrant recognized Okta (Auth0) as a Leader based on our Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision.  
Auth0 believes that CIAM should do more to balance the three forces of security, privacy and convenience — not just keeping the bad actors out, but also driving customer loyalty and conversion and revenue to create a great experience for our customers, partners, and their end-users.
We believe vendors' experience in the space is a key consideration for Gartner in their Magic Quadrant Evaluations. As stated by one of our customers in their review of Auth0, included in the 2021 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer Access Management Report, Auth0 comes with great features out-of-the-box. We went live easily with Auth0 as our Identity Provider. The platform/vendor does not just support us in a technical angle, but also understanding our user journey and sharing their experience (with other clients) and what approaches to take to minimize risk and even enhance user experience during the migration. — VP, Core Product Development, Retail industry

We are proud to announce that Auth0, a product unit within Okta, has been recognized as a Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management, Worldwide. Gartner defines the Access Management market as: "The access management (AM) market is defined by customers’ needs to establish, enforce, and manage run-time access controls for internal and external types of identities, as well as machine identities, interacting with cloud, modern standards-based web and legacy web applications" Auth0 focuses on SaaS-delivered developer-centric and Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) use cases.
For more information, please download the full 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management report.

The Magic Quadrant recognized Okta (Auth0) as a Leader based on our Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision.  
Auth0 believes that CIAM should do more to balance the three forces of security, privacy and convenience — not just keeping the bad actors out, but also driving customer loyalty and conversion and revenue to create a great experience for our customers, partners, and their end-users.
We believe vendors' experience in the space is a key consideration for Gartner in their Magic Quadrant Evaluations. As stated by one of our customers in their review of Auth0, included in the 2021 Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customer Access Management Report, Auth0 comes with great features out-of-the-box. We went live easily with Auth0 as our Identity Provider. The platform/vendor does not just support us in a technical angle, but also understanding our user journey and sharing their experience (with other clients) and what approaches to take to minimize risk and even enhance user experience during the migration. — VP, Core Product Development, Retail industry

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have many different places where I have to use the same logic, so I have generalized my logic system into a class...
...
const contextLayer = new contextLayerCore(...useState([]));
...

This class provides me with a bunch of functions like addContext, removeAll, etc. However, the addContext function is a bit problematic...
...
addContext(context: listing) {
  this.setState([...this.state, context]);
}
...

Simple enough; all it does is append an object using the setState function which should re-render any components using the state. Here's the problem, this causes an infinite loop...
...
this.setState([...this.state, context]);
//                     ^
// also updates when state updates, hence re-runs the setState function
...

This causes and infinite loop. I could using useEffect(..., []) to make it not be dependant, however, this is a function inside a class, thus it breaks React's rules of hooks.
I have to retain the functionality of this class, so I cannot move the function up into the component(s) as a lot of components use this class and would simply create duplicate code.
And example of where it is used...
...
<ContextSuperContainer render={contextLayer.state} />
...

What should I do? Is there an alternative of useEffect? Should I be using a different system for this purpose?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's see how you can connect to a MySQL database using Node.js, the popular JavaScript runtime environment.


Create a MySQL database



mysql -u USER -p



CREATE DATABASE employees;

USE employees;
Create a table in the database:


CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (    
id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,    
name varchar(50),    
PRIMARY KEY (id)  
);
INSERT INTO employees (nombre) VALUES ("Silvia");  
INSERT INTO employees (nombre) VALUES ("Luigi");  
INSERT INTO employees (nombre) VALUES ("Alejandro");




 


Install node-mysql
You will need to have the node-mysql package installed, so if you don't have it installed, you will need to install it. To do this you must use the npm package manager:


npm install mysql



Establish the MySQL connection



var mysql = require('mysql');  
var conexion= mysql.createConnection({      
   host : 'localhost',      
   database : 'employees',      
   user : 'USER',      
   password : 'PASS',  
});    
conexion.connect(function(err) {     
   if (err) {          
       console.error('Error de conexion: ' + err.stack);          
       return;      
   }      
   console.log('Connected to the identifier ' + conexion.threadId); 
});



conexion.query('SELECT * FROM empleados', function (error, results, fields) {
      if (error)          
          throw error;        
      results.forEach(result => {          
      console.log(result);      
      });  
});
Finally, terminate the connection:


connection.end();

This is the last article in the series and in this final article we will be taking a look how to create a wrapper component for conditional rendering of components based on user permissions.
Why do we need it? Because it is more convenient to wrap a component in a wrapper than to call a hook in every case we need conditional rendering.
Let's create an interface to represent the props of our future wrapper component in our models folder:
// ./permissions-validation/models/with-permissions-props.ts
import { ReactElement } from 'react';

export interface WithPermissionsProps {

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most people have seen them, those immensely long import paths like the example below:
import module from "../../../../../modules/module.ts";

To improve this, you can use import aliases and make it look like the example
import module from "@/modules/module.ts";

The benefit of this is readability and that you can move files and folders to sub or parent directories without changing the import paths.
Tools like Vue CLI are supporting this out-of-the-box, but if you want to use the new blazing-fast build tool Vite, you'll need to (at the time of writing)
For this to work, all tools need to know that import aliases are used by modifying each tool's configuration file.
Vite has a configuration file called vite.config.ts and by adding the resolve object Vite will know that import aliases are being used:
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import path from "path";

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
    },
  },
});

By adding a paths object to the compilerOptions inside the tsconfig.json like the example below TypeScript will also know that import aliases are being used:
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src"]
    }
  }
}

At last Jest knows that aliasses are being used by adding the moduleNameMapper to the jest.config.ts configuration file like the code below:
// jest.config.ts
module.exports = {
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "^@/(.*)$": "<rootDir>/src/$1",
  },
};]]></summary>

In the second part, I show you how to add an SQS queue that triggers a lambda. 
There are many ways of doing this but I think the easiest is to use CloudFormation. It is also possible to use frameworks like CDK or Terraform but CloudFormation is best integrated into Amplify.

My partner and I finally decided to open-source most of the work and bring it back to the community instead of building it all over again closed-source.
I've not even imagined the amount of traction the repository got in the last couple of days. How did happen you ask?
When first releasing the library we only introduced a node.js library to unify all the notification channels into a single API. Send emails, SMS, and other mediums with the same code. Need to change SES to SendGrid? No problem. Just a single line of code.
This got some traction, but nothing impressive so far.

The Random Numbers come from a particular seed number which is usually the system clock.Run the program below to understand the security risk.




The Python Documentation also has a warning about the same: "The pseudo-random generators of this module should not be used for security purposes."
So all the password generators you have built using random module are not secure!? So How do we generate cryptographically secure numbers/passwords?
But there is another line after that warning:
For security or cryptographic uses, see the secrets module."
The secrets module is used for generating cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets.

Linux is one of the most popular operating systems in the world. It is Unix-like, and it is also open-source. Quite a big percentage of developers use Linux because it can be customized in so many ways.
What's cool about Linux is its command line. Every 'hackers' paradise. There are a ton of commands. If you aren't familiar with any Linux commands, be sure to check out this post on the 8 Linux Commands Everyone Should Know.
There is probably a command for almost anything that you want to do. For example what if you wanted to get the size of a directory? Well luckily for you there is a command for that. In this post, we are going to talk about that command and see what it can offer.

GraphQL is a query language designed to build client applications by providing an intuitive and flexible syntax and system for describing their data requirements and interactions.
GraphQL does not mandate a particular programming language or storage system for application services that implement it. Instead, application services take their capabilities and map them to a uniform language, type system, and philosophy that GraphQL encodes.
This provides a unified interface friendly to product development and a powerful platform for tool-building.

Wouldn't you find it strange if adults who are fluent in the same language spoke to each other using the vocabulary of a 3-year-old? Well, something analogous is happening when browsers and JavaScript servers exchange data using JSON, the de facto serialization format on the internet.
For example, if we wanted to send a Date object from a JavaScript server to a browser, we would have to:
Convert the Date object to a number.
Convert the number to a JSON string.
Send the JSON string to the browser.
Revert the JSON string to a number.
Realize the number represents a date.

Wouldn't it be convenient if you could easily check the settings of tsconfig.json you are using? 
tsconf-checker, a package that can solve such problems.

        "module": "commonjs",

        "strict": true,
        "strictFunctionTypes": true,
        "skipLibCheck": true
    }
}

Specify the typescript file that targets tsconfig.json you want to check and execute the following command.
npx tsconf-checker index.ts

The result of the check is displayed.
Warning: 'strictFunctionTypes' is implicitly true because 'strict' option is true.
Warning: 'skipLibCheck' option is officially recommended to be false.
Warning: 'esModuleInterop' option is officially recommended to be false.
Warning: 'forceConsistentCasingInFileNames' option is officially recommended to be false.

This function is perfect for you who want to have fun.]]></summary>

The issue could be small - say a performance impact that doesn’t really affect successful operations. Alternatively, the impact could be massive - an outage that has ceased all operations with data loss, revenue loss, and damaged reputation (consider the recent Facebook outage or Roblox outage).
When an incident occurs, organizations will typically be alerted from a monitoring tool. These tools have parameters and ranges of acceptable use (think too many 500s, or too long to respond).

It’s a popular principle among back-end frameworks - Laravel heavily reuses parts of Symfony, Symfony by default comes bundled with Doctrine, Nest depends on Express (which even can be replaced with other implementation on demand). Yet, in the front-end field, each of the big frameworks is built fully independently (correct me, if I’ve missed something). 
For the initial build of Ovee.js, we’ve chosen on-change for handling simple reactivity, and lit-html for templating. We’ve also built an optional module on top of Barba for asynchronous page transitions. This decision helped us to…]]></summary>

In this post we will describe how to use it and examples of some use cases.

The first 2 days were spent searching and starring projects. Now and then, some issues seemed very daunting while some seemed very simple. I also had to ignore the thousands of DSA repositories which were not purged in the first few days. After a lot of searching, I found my first issue and got assigned to it.
2 tasks which I felt were a good test of my skills
Portfolio-Builder Issue #1 - Here I had to develop a contact me section for the command line based portfolio builder which used NodeJS, Inquirer and ReactJS. 
validation on the backend, conditional rendering on the frontend and other small bugfixes.
Stay-Productive Landing Page Issue #3 - Here I had to add a new route to show the what's new page with query parameters to and from. I also had to validate the format of the input. While the task was simple, just going through the whole codebase of the landing page and the Chrome plugin helped me learn a lot. I was also introduced to ESlint and testing friendly code.

Bauddhik Geeks, Ilya flowwishthebest and alemayhu for being so supportive.
Apprehension is everyone's bane, only by trying (failing or succeeding) one can get rid of it.
Dividing the task into smaller subtasks and thinking on one at a time helps a lot.

With Angular 8, the Builders API was released, and it includes the ability to override commands such as ng build, ng test, and ng lint. Not to be confused with Angular Schematics, which can be used to add custom commands to ng generate or provide support for ng add.
We introduced the workspace file (angular.json) in the Angular CLI about a year ago, and we reworked several key principles of how its commands were implemented as a result. We ended up placing the following commands in boxes:

 Everyone has widespread access to windows but they may or maynot be savvy enough to run their favorite flavour of linux due to various constraints
WSL2 really makes life easy for those devs who can't access linux through a cloud provider or locally run it on their devices.
WSL has support for various distros like Debian, Arch and Ubuntu.
Now coming to the interesting part, windows has all access to the CPU and memory resources in your device and it is built in a way which will optimize the resource utilization but how do you limit your linux subsystem, let  us say you'd like to manipulate the configuration to suit your needs the best, then you should follow these steps.
Shut your current running instance of WSL using this command
wsl --shutdown

Run this command through powershell as administrator
Create a configuration file for WSL on your user profile directory
notepad "$env:USERPROFILE\.wslconfig"

 This is the most important step in this project, so please follow carefully 
The following parameters define their corresponding resources:
CPU  = > cores dedicated to WSL
Memory  = > RAM allocated to WSL
AutoMount  = > Mount your default NTFS drive to your subsystem
Boot => defines your booting options for services
Kernel  = > Custom kernel for linux
LocalhostForwarding  = > for port-forwarding your applications running on localhost
My configuration for CPU and memory:
[wsl2]
memory=9GB  
processors=4

This is how you can configure your resources for WSL 😀. Feel free to leave some comments down below⬇️.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[簡介


Cockpit 是一個由 Red Hat 所資助的開源軟體，做為一個 Linux 的 web 管理介面，讓我們可以用瀏覽器就能管理系統事務而無須動用男子漢的文字指令。
條列式 Cockpit 的功能與特色：
有美美的圖表即時顯示系統負載
顯示一些基本的軟硬體資訊
關機、重開機
顯示系統日誌
管理儲存空間
管理網路介面
管理帳戶
管理服務，不用碰 systemctl

內建終端機，Cockpit web 做不到的事可以在終端機做
模組化設計，可以安裝或自行開發擴充模組
以 Elementary OS / Ubuntu 來說，在出廠的 APT 庫已經內建了 Cockpit，所以只要一行即可裝起來：
sudo apt install cockpit

其它的 Linux 可以參閱 Cockpit 的安裝文件。
安裝之後 Cockpit 會以服務的形式在背景運作，服務的名稱就叫做 Cockpit Web Service。因為是服務，當然也會常態的佔據一部分的記憶體，有必要的話可以改成平時關閉，要用時再用 systemctl 把 Cockpit Web Service 叫起來。（不過我就是不想用 systemctl 來管服務才裝 Cockpit 的啊…）
另外在 Elementary OS / Ubuntu 的 APT 庫內還有一些模組可以安裝，包括 Docker 的管理等等的，可以自行選用。
Cockpit 會在本機的 9090 埠提供服務，所以只要 Cockpit Web Service 有啟動的狀態下，用瀏覽器開 http://localhost:9090/ 就會進到 Cockpit 的登入頁。

登入之後的各模組使用應該是一望即知，就不多做介紹了。
因為 Cockpit 是 web，所以就需要多考慮存取的控制，要禁止本機以外的機器存取到 Cockpit 的話，請在防火牆設定那邊確定沒有開放 9090 埠。
以 Elementary OS 為例，在 系統設定值 安全與隱私 防火牆 那邊可以做設定。

對 9090 埠做限制，禁止外部訪問，或只允許信任的 IP 訪問。]]></summary>

So around 3 months ago I switched to Linux from Windows 10. I have a very low end PC so Windows 10 was lagging a lot so I thought to switch to Linux. 
I definitely ran a lot better than windows. But after some time, It's UI also seemed a bit boring to me. So the I installed the KDE PLasma desktop environment on top of it. And I just loved it.
KDE has a lot of features and is very customizable
Very user friendly


Customisation
Noctis Round Theme




Keyboard Shortcuts


Addons 







System Wide Search
KDE has KRunner, which is a system wide search & its much faster than  Window's search. 

There are many other features in KDE that I like. 
Conclusion:


I just love KDE Plasma & its a great alternative for Windows. 
I am not switching back to Windows anytime soon. 
So if you want to switch from Windows, try KDE plasma.]]></summary>
