Event Emitter √© um m√≥dulo do NodeJS que nos ajuda a criar um padr√£o de publisher-subscriber.
Com um Event Emitter podemos simplesmente criar um evento de qualquer parte de uma aplica√ß√£o, escutar este evento e tomar alguma a√ß√£o baseado nele.

Para criar um event emitter √© preciso instanciar o EventEmitter do m√≥dulo events no NodeJS.
const { EventEmitter } = require('events');

const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

Esse √© o b√°sico para criar um event emitter. Mas o que podemos fazer com ele? ü§î
A classe do EventEmitter t√™m uma s√©rie de m√©todos e podemos us√°-los para publicar e ouvir eventos. Por hora, focaremos em dois deles:
emit(eventName...)
on(eventName...)
Para publicar um evento n√≥s utilizamos o m√©todo emit(). J√° para ouvir, utilizamos o m√©todo on(). E a ‚Ä¶]]></summary>

This is one of the most important and most complicated virtualization techniques that the operating system performs. Because of that we will discuss memory virtualization in three separate articles. The goals of the operating system with respect to memory are as follows:
Give processes a contiguous address space
Give processes memory isolation from each other
Do both of the above efficiently with respect to memory usage and processing speed
Let‚Äôs first talk about what memory is. Memory can be thought of as a series of slots. 32-bit memory has 32-bit slots and 64-bit memory has 64-bit slots. The size of a computer‚Äôs memory c‚Ä¶]]></summary>

I had to also update the Team Explorer Everywhere (TEE/TEE-cli) that was embedded in that to the latest version. And upgrade java to version 11.   But once that was done, it works well.  Its a tad on the large size for an image.  (1gb), but it seems ok on its memory and CPU usage.  See the kubebox graph at the bottom.

Feature flags or toggles are often* used in application code to allow for rapid integration of new changes without necessarily enabling them in production.
*I have no real idea how commonly used they really are
Feature flags can prevent the dreaded long running feature branch that keeps accumulating changes that you hold off from merging because you're not ready for it to go into production in the next release.
These same challenges can apply to your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) where having changes to shared resources you want to test in a lower environment but aren't ready to promote to production can be a real problem.

The resources of a microservice based applications can be manipulated in several ways. It is possible to create, update, delete them, and do other operations as well.
When we send a request for a service, we need to inform the URI to identify which resources we intend to handle. We also need to inform the type of manipulation we want to do on the resource. For this, we will use the HTTP protocol methods.
The HTTP protocol has several methods, each one has a different function. The most used are:
GET: retrieve data for a resource.
POST: create a new resource.

A tiny, secure, URL-friendly, unique string ID generator for JavaScript.
It is smaller in size as it has no dependencies.
It is 60% faster than UUID.
It uses cryptographically strong random APIs.
It uses a larger alphabet than UUID (A-Za-z0-9_-).
We can control the behaviour of alphabets to be used.

Since I was a child, I only experienced Windows and Mac Os and it is only recently that I started on Linux with a Debian system. It happened that working on Debian was the only way for me to install node.js and make React working.

In an Angular service, you can simply assign a new value to a property, and like magic - the change detection would kick in and update any component using the property. 
Switching over to React, suddenly immutable state is the way to go! Then, suddenly Redux - actions, reducers, middleware, dispatchers, and the list goes on. 
The first time I saw Redux toolkit, the very first thing that hit me, in Reducers:
...
reducers: {
    increment: state => {
        state.value += 1;
    }
}

Assignment operator in a Reducer? For a brief moment I thought I somehow ended up in the Vuex documentation, this is how you update state in mutations. But No, it was Redux Toolkit.

Data validation is the process of checking whether a given value fits certain criteria based on its business requirements.
For any input - a UI input field or an API input body, data validation is crucial. Any arbitrary input should never be trusted. And data validation plays a vital role in making sure these inputs are rigorously funnelled through the right pipes before they create unintended side-effects in our applications.
In JavaScript projects, both the browser and node.js, that is, there are several npm packages available to do data validation. I've personally used joi and yupjs.

The fact that you can do all of your development work in the same tool that is also used to write your code is amazing.
Vim is a powerful text editor with a lot of history and a certain aura of mystique around it. In this article, I'll try to dispel some of the myths around Vim and explain why you should learn to use it on the command line.
Anyone who spends significant time in front of a terminal should consider learning to use vim.
First, why not learn to use Emacs or [insert favorite text editor here]? The two main reasons I like Vim are that it's ubiquitous and easy to use. Most server installations have Vim available. There's even a version included with Mac OS X.
You can use it while coding, writing articles, notes, or even making spreadsheets. It can literally be everywhere you are! You can edit files through ssh! 
Unlike the latest frontend framework or latest shiny language, vim always stays the same through the years. So it's good to learn vim.
Vim has been the main editor used by most Linux users for at least 15 years, so you'll almost certainly find it on any server where you need to log in via SSH.
Learn Vim by interactive exercises, no need to struggle with man pages or blogs.
You can use the keys to navigate your code and vim. Press gg to move to the top of the file, press G to move to the end of the file, press / to search etc.
Once you know the shortcuts, it's a lot easier than grabbing your mouse and going to the menu bar, click edit, click find etc. It saves you a lot of time when coding.
Any reasonably recent version of Vim has strong support for all kinds of programming languages, so it's great for editing source code.
Vim supports all kinds of plugins and can be used even over an ssh connection to a sever. 
On top of that, you can use plugins like YouCompleteMe for code completion and NerdTree for a file browser.]]></summary>

Implement logic for Angular Application

Run and check results
***Note: to do the tutorial, We reuse the sourcecode and continue with the previous post. So please check out it for more details:
Create a new Angular4 Component ‚Äì Multiple Components Angular Application
1. Create an Angular Service
/angular4client/src/app, choose: File -> New -> Service:


Press Finish,

-> New project's structure:

Log: "WARNING Service is generated but not provided, it must be provided to be used"

-> Need register the DataService by using providers property. So we will do it later in a below session.
We got 2 new files: data.service.spec.ts and data.service.ts. Check sourcecode of the main file data.service.ts:

Firstly, it maybe seems overkill to think about the IaC solution deeply. However, In the long run, it can save a ton of deployment time. Thus, I decided to leverage the IasC solutions, which codifies the entire architecture. There are several tools for managing serverless applications, such as AWS SAM, serverless framework, and terraform.

PATH is an environment variable which contains a list of directories separated by :.
echo $PATH it shows me
/home/my_user/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin

Oh, wait! But what are these folders, and what is their use?
Output for echo $PATH may be different for you based on your Linux distros and program you have installed.
So whenever I typed any command in the terminal, OS will start finding that program one-by-one into these directories, whenever it found first match, it will open it. If it can't find the given command it will display an error command not found. 
$PATH.
flutter I can't access it. To get this working I have to update the $PATH variable, something like this
export PATH="$PATH:/home/my_user/flutter/bin"
flutter in terminal you can access it from anywhere.
Are these changes are permanent, what if I close the terminal or shut down my machine, will they persist?
NO. 
.bashrc file, If you are using zsh or any other terminal please update its respective profile/settings file.
export PATH="$PATH:/home/my_user/flutter/bin"
.bashrc file and save the file.
What is $PATH variable?
Update terminal settings file, for bash it is .bashrc

Persian Keyboard was easy to install, but finding/defining a shortcut to switch between keyboard layouts was really though. Finally I find a work-around here.
Sleep by closing lid causes crash. [SOLVED] by arbitrary changes and updates
When using LibreOffice Calc/Writer I encountered several screen mess up in a way that nothing can be read. I forced  to window resize several time again. An update on LibreOffice solved the problem magically.
A border has appeared on my desktop. It is a thick black one. It is not related to graphic card. Because some applications like Firefox and VS Code can easily toggle full screen and used all my screen.
I saw some ACPI Error on startup in first days. It was something related to Graphic card. I did not say the error again.
Wifi interface was not recognized in first place, but some hacks solved the problem.
It seems that my webcam is not recognized yet.
Cannot format/partition USB disk. All guides are about Ubuntu Disks. I need this option specially because my USB is bootable and now it needs to be partitioned again. [SOLVED] I realized that I should use KDE partition manager. Also I can install gnome-disk which is Ubuntu standard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my last post we set up Inertia and Adonis. Now that we have a solid foundation to build upon, let us continue fleshing out our CRM app.
In my previous post we used a closure route to test everything worked end-to-end. This is fine for simple one-off routes (things like the "about" page for instance), but for more demanding routes, we'll usually reach for a controller.
ace to scaffold a resourceful controller:
node ace make:controller user -r


Take a moment to look at the new controller, Ace created for you. This is a basic template for our future CRUD operations:
import { HttpContextContract } from '@ioc:Adonis/Core/HttpContext'

export default class UsersController {
  public async index ({}: HttpContextContract) {
  }

  public async create ({}: HttpContextContract) {
  }

  public async store ({}: HttpContextContract) {
  }

  public async show ({}: HttpContextContract) {
  }

  public async edit ({}: HttpContextContract) {
  }

  public async update ({}: HttpContextContract) {
  }

  public async destroy ({}: HttpContextContract) {
  }
}

Now, let's connect some routes to the users controller.
Open start/routes.ts and delete the route we previously created. Instead add this:
Route.resource('users', 'UsersController');

This doesn't look like much, but let's see what routes were automatically created for us:
node ace list:routes


Pretty neat! Adonis automatically created a route for each controller method.]]></summary>

Creating frontend is not as easy as it is learning html/css/js. The real hard work starts when you start using frameworks and libraries to make your frontend look more exciting.
But, once you reach above it all you start to detail with some of the complex process and errors of web development thrown by some of the coolest frameworks and libraries you just used. 
To be frank, debugging these errors is not always hard but sometimes it can be a situation when you don't want to loose the war. The complete outcome depends upon your solution, and uh yes, clock is ticking too. You wanna meet the deadline too.
It's not the end. 
You still have animations and other libraries to use in your project too. So, you don't waste any more time and start using them. Now, you are in the biggest hole you created yourself.
Keep debugging my dear friend.
See you next time.

I have read a lot of exciting, helpful and inspiring articles/posts on dev.to and have felt like giving something back for a long time. Additionally a colleague of mine have been pushing me to writing a blog post for a long time (thank you, Jonathan) so I thought this fuck up and how it was solved, might as well be helpful, interesting and inspiring for others.
Please don't hesitate to give any kind of feedback for my first post!
As the title indicates, I committed and pushed a secret to git. I had to run some code locally relying on this secret and as I were eager to resolve the problem I was working on, I eventually forgot all about the secret.... So I staged the file files, wrote a commit message, committed them and pushed it all to GitHub, including the secret and boom! ‚Ä¶]]></summary>

This post assumes you are following along with the baseline project tutorial, but the concepts apply to any Typescript project.
In the previous post, we implemented listeners to the uncaughtException and unhandledRejection events in node to ensure any unexpected errors crash the application.
express framework, by default, handles any errors that occur within a route and sends an error response to the HTTP client. Even if these errors are unexpected errors that should cause our program to terminate, they will be caught before they can bubble up to our handle function.
In addition, the default error handler responds with an HTML page, which isn't ideal. For our API, it would be better if we could send some nicely structured, predictable‚Ä¶]]></summary>

So, what if I tell you that you can secure your apps with no VPN client required? Yep, it's possible with GCP Identity-Aware Proxy

For the purposes of this guide we will deploy the basic app scaffold provided by create-next-app
Since we will be using Amplify, we first need to go through the installation and setup process. We can figure out how to do that by following the official docs.
Once we have Amplify configured we can go ahead and create a project. We can achieve that by running amplify init

Amplify provides a zero config deploy similar to vercel, which allows us to connect a git provider to use for our deployments. To get started we can go the the Amplify console and select Host web app.

We can now select our preferred git provider such as Github for this example.

After selecting our desired git provider we can select which branch we would like to deploy from.

After selecting a branch we can now configure our build settings, for the most part we won't need to modify this config as Amplify will take care of that for us.

Now we can review everything looks correct before triggering a deploy.

Finally we can see the deployment starting and in a few minutes our site will be live!

Thanks to Amplify we can now deploy Next.js SSR app on AWS with a relatively low effort. Let me know what you think about this new feature!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this episode of Nx After Dark, we're creating an Nx workspace for an Angular 12 app called Energy Insights. We're also setting up a GitHub Actions workflow and connecting it to Nx Cloud.




Follow the instructions below to set up a similar workspace or browse the end result at github/LayZeeDK/energy-insights.
Node.js 14.x
PNPM
Note that there's currently an issue with using Cypress with PNPM. Let me know if you figure out how to fix it. Until then, remove Cypress from the workspace or use either Yarn or NPM.
# Install the Nx workspace generator
pnpm install --global create-nx-workspace
# Generate a blank Nx workspace
pnpm init nx-workspace my-workspace --preset=empty --pm=pnpm --npm-scope=my-workspace --nx-cloud

# Install the "json" utility
npm install --global json
# Set the base branch to "main"
json -I -f nx.json -e "this.affected.defaultBase = 'main';"

# Add Angular capability
pnpm add --save-dev @nrwl/angular
# Initialize Angular workspace
nx generate @nrwl/angular:init

# Generate Angular app project
nx generate app my-app

See the video for examples of:
Setting up generator defaults
Creating a GitHub Actions CI workflow
Setting up GitHub workflow triggers
Connecting Nx Cloud for distributed computation caching
Remove Cypress]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[üìå The Auth0 Identity Maturity Framework helps you understand what‚Äôs working about your current identity implementation and what needs to mature.



  
  
  
Today‚Äôs users are accustomed to living and working online, and they expect a secure, effortless experience every time they access your platform. Seamless authentication is no longer a nice-to-have; it‚Äôs a requirement for success. And since companies are building more custom applications, users need fast, secure access across multiple platforms and devices. Identity touches every aspect of your business, so managing identity is more complex and more critical than ever before.
In response, organizations are exploring the value of third-party identity-as-a-service (IDaaS) platforms like Auth0. These solutions offer a centralized source of truth for authentication, authorization, and customer insight.
Identity maturity is a way of thinking about the efficacy of your existing identity solution and its capacity to handle new business requirements and customer demands as you grow and scale. Achieving identity maturity involves understanding what a fully functional, centralized authentication solution looks like. Evaluating your current state, creating a plan to improve your identity infrastructure, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement are also key to reaching identity maturity.
As an IDaaS provider, Auth0 works with organizations of all sizes in a diverse array of industries to tackle identity challenges. In doing so, we‚Äôve learned a huge amount about the identity models that work for particular business needs and goals.  
In fact, we‚Äôve consolidated our expertise and our customers‚Äô knowledge and experiences into a solution we call the Auth0 Identity Maturity Framework (IMF): a collection of tools, tactics, and expert input that will help you understand what‚Äôs working about your identity solution and what needs to change.
