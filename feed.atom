The name of this new package of packages, Nemo.
Fishy , I think. No less than 8 packages in one, all just for the api client code?! Coming from a place where we just simply used an instance of Axios with the bare minimum configuration and direct calls to the backend REST api, this sounds like madness to me.

It also outlines a reference architecture that addresses common scalability and high availability requirements.


When the first version of WordPress was released in 2003, it was not built with modern elastic and scalable cloud-based infrastructures in mind. 


Through the work of the WordPress community and the release of various WordPress modules, the capabilities of this CMS solution are constantly expanding.


Today, it is possible to build a WordPress architecture that takes advantage of many of the benefits of the AWS Cloud.

Convox is showing its age and this year we began the process of replacing Convox with HashiCorp’s Nomad, a flexible workload orchestrator to deploy and manage our containers on AWS.
As we prepared our migration to Nomad, our biggest concern was performance. We started our tests with a barebones proof-of-concept setup of our API in Nomad. We benchmarked and compared the two systems and found Nomad was running slower.

you can find more on this link
npm is package manager tool for JavaScript in almost every web development project especially front-end projects. 
But this tools comes with different problems I'm sure your facing now which are:
the install process is kind of slow
not very friend log message.
large node_modules folder in every single project.
Facebook came up with an alternative tool yarn, it bit faster and have more friendly code log but have the same storage issue. I used to solve this issue by creating a main node_modules folder in my hard disk and use symlinks to all my folders, but it's kind of frustrating so I drop this solution not very long after.
recently I have read about a new tool that solves the three issues that we discussed above that tool is called pnpm. pnpm is tools that is very similar to npm, if familiar with how npm commands pnpm is just the same. when using npm or yarn if have 1000 project that means you will have 1000 dependencies folder in each project in your hard drive, pnpm will install all the dependencies in one universal folder that is linked to all of your 1000 project using sumlinks that is managed for you under the hood.
this approach solve all the issues that we discussed earlier if you have already installed a dependency it will use that one instead of downloading in from the start. this means less storage used and faster installing process how cool is that, it even have a very minimalist log message. 
the first day I used pnpm I felt over the top because it solves an issue I hated so mush and after couple of days using it I've had no issues using it so I felt that I need to share this tool with everyone that didn't hear about.
conclusion:
if you know any other tools that I didn't hear about I'd love you to share your knowledge with me.]]></summary>

Lots of developers use Linux, but "Linux" is a vast category.  There are a lot of similarities, but a lot of differences, too.  Ubuntu and Fedora look and feel pretty similar until you try to install a package - whoops, apt is a little different than dnf. Specific system settings may be stored in different places, and particular commands may be included by default in one but not the other.  Then there's even more niche stuff like Arch, which you install piece by piece from a very minimal package set, or Gentoo, which is similar to Arch with the additional caveat that the user compiles all the software locally for their specific hardware.  Users of these distros may end up with pretty different-looking operating systems that all fall under the broad Linux umbrella.

Data sources in Terraform are used to get information about resources external to Terraform, and use them to set up your Terraform resources. For example, a list of IP addresses a cloud provider exposes.
We can find excellent examples of data source usage in the AWS provider docs:
variable "vpc_id" {}

data "aws_vpc" "selected" {
  id = var.vpc_id
}

resource "aws_subnet" "example" {
  vpc_id            = data.aws_vpc.selected.id
  availability_zone = "us-west-2a"
  cidr_block        = cidrsubnet(data.aws_vpc.selected.cidr_block, 4, 1)
}

In this scenario, we may have created our aws_vpc manually, because it also contains other manually created resources, and now we want to start adding Terraform managed resources to it.

DEMO HERE

My first attempt was to use an interceptor service that contained a BehaviorSubject (Observable). I set it up to maintain a counter and set the observable's value to true if there were more than zero (0) requests in-flight.
Through heavy use of the console.log functionality, I came to realize that the interceptor was not always active, even though I was following proper singleton patterns.
The second attempt went more smoothly.
I had a second service (a handler) that maintained the counts and the BehaviorSubject. This one worked "like a charm."

First, we need to create a Node.js project and add npm packages "Puppeeteer" and "Puppeteer stealth plugin". To do this, in the directory with our project, open the command line and enter:
npm init -y
npm i puppeteer puppeteer-extra puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth

puppeteer.use(StealthPlugin());

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An API exposes valuable data to be used by programs. REST is a standardized client-server architecture for APIs where resources are available at specific URLs. The client can query them (GET) and even write, modify and delete entries when specific endpoints exist.
GraphQL is a new approach. In most configurations, you will use one endpoint only to combine multiple queries in a single request.
It has many advantages over REST that can make sense, but it might raise security issues as well:
the default /graphql endpoint URL is quite often used in production, so it is an easy target
the introspection feature is sometimes left enabled on production, which can lead to non-public information disclosure
self-inflicted DDOS (distributed denial-of-service) are not uncommon because GraphQL queries can be significantly larger than REST queries (e.g., 10000 users and 70 posts per user makes 700 000 nodes to retrieve)
GraphQL schema design can be quite challenging, leading to expose more information than intended
string injections are not uncommon as queries are usually wrapped in JSON
everything connects to everything else, sometimes leading to authorization bypass when checks are not performed for each node
However, there are measures you can take:
don't use the default endpoint /graphql
force SSL everywhere
use standardized authentication such as JWTs or OAuth
limit GraphQL operations to authenticated requests, as you're not a public platform such as GitHub
limit query depth and add pagination
use static queries and avoid dynamically generated queries at runtime when it's possible
disable logging, debugging and exploration tools on production (including GraphiQL), not only for security reasons but also for performance
Read the OWASP cheat sheet for more details.

Using a browser-based GraphiQL interface — such as the GraphiQL explorer provided by Contentful — you can inspect your schema right there in the browser, and construct your queries in no time. But how can you make sure your GraphQL queries are safe from nasties? Let’s find out.
To inspect your schema in Contentful’s GraphiQL interface and construct a GraphQL query, enter this URL in your browser, and swap out the SPACE_ID for your Contentful space ID, and ACCESS_TOKEN for your Contentful Delivery API Key.

When going into software development, for most web applications, there is a need to store data, persistently, in some form or the other. This could include the need to store login/authentication information, financial details, an e-shopper's cart, training data for a machine learning model, etc. Amazingly, there are myriads of ways to store this data, examples include JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), XML, CSV (comma-separated values), or in a database, the most popular option, of course, being the mo…]]></summary>

자, 개발을 하다보면 자동완성 하다보면,
toString() 메소드는 많이 익숙할 것이다.
valueOf() 메소드는 왜 있는가?
Date 객체 많이들 쓰고 있을 것이다. 이것이 편하든 불편하든 간에 많이들 쓸 것이다.
Date 객체를 다루다 보면 알게 되는게,
+new Date() 가 먹힌다. 결과는 new Date().getTime() 과 동일하다.
Date 객체 간 비교가 가능하다. oldDate < newDate 식이 잘 먹힌다.
이러하다. 이게 가능한 이유가 바로 valueOf() 이다.
Date.prototype.getTime() 메소드를 호출하면 나오는 유닉스 밀리초 숫자가 나온다. JS 에서 날짜 비교하거나 뭐 여러가지 다양한 용도에 활용할 수 있다.
+new Date() 가 왜 먹히냐면, 더하기 문자가 valueOf() 메소드의 축약어로 사용할 수 있기 때문이다.
< > 등의 비교문을 가능하게 한 것도? 맞다. valueOf() 메소드를 호출해서 비교하기 때문에 가능하다는 것이다.
valueOf() 메소드의 설명을 MDN에서 보도록 하자.
valueOf() 메서드는 특정 객체의 원시 값을 반환합니다.
원시 값이라면 생각나는게 숫자일 것이다. 부울 값도 있고.
[] 배열 식과, "문자열" 문자열 식도 원시 값으로 취급한다. 심지어 {} 같은 객체 식도. 원시 객체라 한다.
"문자열".valueOf() 호출하면 문자열 그대로 나올 것이다.
그렇다면, 자신의 객체나 클래스에 valueOf() 재정의 하고 싶다?

Some time ago, I challenged myself to build a robust backend solution in JavaScript. Many developers believe that JavaScript isn't secure enough, efficient or simply organized to manage data through APIs. I'll convince you otherwise....
For this new project, I chose technologies that are on the rise, in particular PostgreSQL but especially NestJS. So, I gave up my good old database that is MongoDB, in favor of a more traditional database.
NB: I was a little bit rusty at first, but going back to relational database was a real good idea; if only to retrieve data from several tables in one call, unlike NoSQL which requires as many calls as there are documents to query... Finally, SQL is like riding a bike, it's unforgettable 😉

One of the best examples of privacy nightmare is TikTok is. It collects some very troubling data points such as the number of CPUs your device has, available disk space, your IP & MAC addresses, whether your phone is jailbroken, and so much more, which does not have anything to do with TikTok. Imagine that there are so many more applications and websites that do essentially the same thing and sell your information to 3rd party advertisers. Internet is slowly becoming a place where one company can easily predict what type of person you are, based on all data points that they collected over time.
To end this, I have open-sourced the social network that I was working on for more than a year! It is called Polygon and the main goal for it is to be a social network that is not hungry for your data. Both the core and front-end are written in TypeScript and are seeking support from the open-source community. We also have a hosting guide that is written in Python.There is also some tooling written in Go. My main goal is to make it a private, easy-to-use, and crisp social network which will be adapted by privacy and open-source enthusiasts all over the world. 
Polygon is also open for Hacktoberfest contributions, which means that both beginners and professionals can contribute to the project and learn something new!

Policy checks - thanks to #kyverno team, e.g. Jim Bugwadia has a good check rule at https://lnkd.in/gtUy-UNu ! Another good reason to use Policy in k8s to safeguard any CVEs.


there are 3 diff. k8s ingress controllers - see my post at

Open the Windows Subsystem for Linux app and enable developer mode. An IP address and port will be shown, use this to execute the ADB command:
adb connect <IP address:PORT>
Now simply open Windows PowerShell or CMD and type
adb install "<path to APK file>"
That's it, and your APK will be installed, all you need to do now is open Start and find your installed app in the list!
NOTE: Make sure WSA is running. To run WSA open the app and select open "File".]]></summary>

We already know how to do this with jest, but while it is pretty convenient and quite easy to set up, it's also considerably slow and somewhat opinionated. Unlike more lightweight test runners, it also has a built-in code transformation API, a jsdom-based DOM environment and chooses browser conditional exports by default.
So what we need to run our tests without jest is:
Code transformation
DOM environment
Choosing browser exports
To save even more of your precious time, I already did all this work for you. You just need to install

Encryption transforms readable plaintext into unreadable ciphertext that only the intended users can understand. This prevents attackers from making sense of the data even if they get access to it. The intended users will be aware of how to convert the ciphertext into plaintext, a process known as decryption.
A simple encryption example is, say alphabet A -> 1, B -> 2, C -> 3, so on.. So the word CAB would be 321. The receiver will convert the 321 back to plain text by mapping the numbers to alphabets -> CAB.

Maintainers are the keystone of open source. This year’s Hacktoberfest has a new, added focus: empowering open source maintainers.
Community Events Platform Project by this Hacktoberfest is to support and guide new joiners who are willing to contribute, I opened everything in terms of issues and created basic issues and middle level issues, so that every level of joiner can contribute, sometimes I hookup the calls with joiners, I did the guidance calls with contributors from India and South Africa to give them a overall walk through.

Github - ComEve

Volunteer and giving up personal time to create something of value for the world.
Reviewing and Merging Pull Request
Collaborations with Developers throughout the world.
Maintain a project when you own a team.
Be respectful and allow people to contribute in a way that makes the project better.
Encourage developers however the pull request is buggy and production breaking ding, motivate them to fix and fly high as per terms of opensource.

Almost two years ago I lost my iMac and it brought me an idea to see what's changed in the Linux world for 10 years. Starting from Ubuntu and Fedora I finally came to the elementary OS project's website. And it was quite astonishing. In comparison to the other distributions elementary had its view on how the operating system should view, how to make apps, its own design language and developers documentation. Thereby the decision to move to this OS was easy.
For now, it is almost two years since I moved from macOS to elementary OS as my daily driver. And, as I said earlier, I'm a developer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Merhabalar, bu yazıda Linux sistemlerde yeni bir kullanıcı oluşturmayı, oluşturduğumuz kullanıcıya şifre atamayı, root yetkisi vermeyi ve yetkilerini görüntülemeyi inceleyeceğiz. İyi okumalar :)
Yeni bir kullanıcı oluşturmak için;
sudo useradd <username>

komutu kullanılır.

Oluşturulan kullanıcıya şifre atamak için;
sudo passwd <username>

komutu kullanılır.

Tüm kullanıcıların görüntüleyebileceği dosyalar, çalıştırabileceği komutlar olduğu gibi sadece root yetkisine sahip kullanıcıların görüntüleyebileceği dosyalar ve çalıştırabileceği komutlar da vardır.
Oluşturduğumuz kullanıcıya, 

Bir kullanıcı root yetkisine sahip olduğunda istediği bütün işlemleri gerçekleştirebilir. Sistemi daha esnek ve güvenli kullanmak için root yetkisi verirken dikkatli olmalıyız. Root yetkisine sahip kullanıcıları;
cat /etc/sudoers
dosyası altında görüntüleyebiliriz.
Bu dosyayı düzenlemek için ;
sudo visudo 

komutu kullanılır.

Komutu çalıştırıp, rootun bulunduğu kısmın altına,
<username> ALL=(ALL)    ALL

satırını ekleyerek kendi kullanıcımıza bütün izinleri vererek, kullanıcımıza root yetkisi vermiş oluruz.

Bir kullanıcının hangi yetkilere sahip olduğunu görmek için; 
sudo -l 
komutu kullanılır.]]></summary>

Effects are a powerful model for handling side effects in your application. Commonly this means when you are making a HTTP request in a NgRx powered application you will use an effect to handle the communication with the service but they can do so much more than that. And frankly this is what I usually used them for until I read https://timdeschryver.dev/blog/start-using-ngrx-effects-for-this#handling-the-flow-of-a-angular-material-dialog . 
I became intrigued by the idea of offloading some component material dialog code into the effect and started viewing the life cycle as a series of events and using the effect to talk to other effects.
