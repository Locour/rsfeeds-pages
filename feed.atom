        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not gonna talk about how does a DHCP server work exactly, 
If one of the devices in the network is configured with a static IP address, when the DHCP server starts distributing the IP addresses to other machines, what happens exactly ? does it skip it ? or does it duplicate it and therefore there would be a conflict ? 
So the answer is, NOPE the DHCP server will not distribute that IP address, you may be wondering, but how ?
Remember that the DHCP server sends an ARP Broadcast asking about the IP address about to be distributed 
"Who has x.x.x.x"
At that moment the machine with that static IP address will respond with an ARP saying that it got that IP and that its MAC address is X:X:X:X:X:X so the DHCP server will continue to the next IP address asking "Who has y.y.y.y"
But here comes another problem, 
what if the local network is placed behind a router, and we all know that the routers doesn't allow broadcasting, then what happens ?
well simply instead of ARP Broadcasting, it uses ICMP Packet type 8 code 0 which is the ECHO request ( ping ) and if it gets no answer than it distributes it, else it simply continues to the next IP address.
And here comes the last question, 
And what if a device that is configured with a static IP address was shutdown, and the DHCP distributed its IP address, what happens if the machine is up again?
well there are two solutions for this, some DHCP servers are advanced enough and caches the static IP address and therefore this conflict will never occurs, but if the DHCP server doesn't provide this feature, than it should be configured to exclude these IP addresses or else there will be an IP Duplication.
And this pretty much sums up the main problems of dealing with a DHCP server.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continuous Integration is a great software development practice, we can reduce integration problems and we can allow teams to develop cohesive software more rapidly.
There are many interesting CI tools in the market but I think the dev CI experience can still be improved. I see companies and dev teams struggling and disappointed when they have to run and setup CI pipelines.
Most of the IT companies care about code privacy and they don’t like the idea to run their code on external public CI platforms. It's possible to have CI solutions on-premise but most of the time this kind of solutions are expensive for the company. For example, Atlassian has stopped selling new on-prem server licenses. ref.







  
  
  Build queue and CI debug:



As a developer and member of a tech team I’d like to see our CI builds running immediately after a code change and I’d like to see an easy way for debugging the code when it’s running on CI. Most of the time I see teams and developers complaining about long builds queues and usually it’s even quite difficult debugging the code if an error happens during the CI process.
How many times we see commits failing on CI because the code has not been tested enough locally or the code has not been rebased with the main branch yet. Every time we run a build on Cloud it’s a cost for the team and the company. The good news is we can now easily avoid this scenario. Few years ago, Git has introduced "Git hooks", this new technology allows developers to execute pre-tests before a commit will trigger a new CI process in Cloud.
After a long brainstorming with some friends, we created a small CI tool localci.io to address all these issues. This tool doesn’t fit with any IT infrastructure, but this could be useful at least for some team. Probably, in the future it will be completely free but currently we still need to cover some cloud costs.]]></summary>

Continous integration and delivery make up the devops lifecycle. There are 8 phases in the devops lifecyle. 
Continous delivery make up the first four phases which include: plan, code, build and test. Continous integration make up the last four phases which include: integrate, deploy, operate and monitor.
Jenkins is a tool for integrating automatically into the existing codebase after testing is complete. It spans both continous delivery (build and test phase) and continous integration (integration).

Karena menurut data statistik, 1 juta website terpopuler pake Linux buat OS Server-nya.
Lalu, kita ngga bisa denial kalo OS pilihan dari kebanyakan hacker itu ya Linux..
Ini karena hacker-hacker tuh suka otak-atik semaunya sendiri dan karena Linux itu open-source, Linux bisa di-customize buat nyesuaiin kebutuhan mereka.
Dan juga, unethical dan bad hackers biasanya pake tools yang mereka bikin sendiri atau yang sudah tersedia di Linux untuk nge-hack ke dalam jaringan dan aplikasi yang lemah dan rentan keamanannya.
Banyak Distro Linux yang sudah terinstall tools buat hacking yang siap pake.
Tapi jika tools tersebut belum ada, maka tinggal diinstall dong wkwk.
Diantara Distro Linux buat hacking yang umum dipake adalah:
Kali Linux, yang berbasis dari varian Debian.
BackBox, yang berbasis dari varian Ubuntu.
Parrot Security OS, yang berbasis dari varian Debian.
CAINE, yang berarti Computer Aided INvestigative Environment yang biasanya dipake buat Digital Forensic dan
Samurai Web Testing Framework untuk pentest (penetration testing) aplikasi web (web application).
Jadi jika kalian mau berkarir di Tim Operations (seperti DevOps dan SRE) maupun belajar hacking sebagai hobi, atau untuk menjadi ethical hacker, kalian wajib belajar dan jago di Linux xD.]]></summary>

before removing let's show all the node_modules directories and its memory. cause the removing process is irrevisable so we need to make sure. first cd into a specific directory where most of the projects are:
LINX/MACOS
$ cd Dev/
$ find . -name "node_modules" -type d -prune | xargs du -chs


WINDOW
$ cd Dev 
$ FOR /d /r . %d in (node_modules) DO @IF EXIST "%d" echo %d"

now let's remove all the node_modules directories from all the projects. make sure that you're inside a directory where you're comfortable removing all the node_modules cause this action is irereversable:
LINUX
$ cd Dev
$ find . -name "node_modules" -type d -prune -exec rm -rf '{}' +

WINDOW
$ cd Dev 
$ FOR /d /r . %d in (node_modules) DO @IF EXIST "%d" rm -rf "%d"

a single node_modules took about 400MB - 90MB in my cases and total space it took around 10gigabyte - 15gigabyte. it will help you to free up some space in your machine if you have limited SSD, but if you've removed from all the directories, you have to install it again for the project you're working on, keep this in mind.

In this blog, we are mainly focusing on how to read email attachments based on the DATE RANGE, FROM particular email address and it's SUBJECT.
Let's see from the below example code which fetches first 3 email messages from the mail box.
var Imap = require('node-imap'),
    inspect = require('util').inspect;

var imap = new Imap({

GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time. As Carpenter notes, because it allows for real-time collaboration, GitHub encourages teams to work together to build and edit their site content.
1.go to github.com and simple create your account .
1.Download git from browser.
https://git-scm.com/ .
1.Now we are Create folder for your project folder use this command (mkdir Demo).

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a “preflight” request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.

The solution to bypass CORS is to use a Proxy. A Proxy server, that forwards your request as it is.
But, problems with a Proxy Server is to manage the server, optimize the server, handle traffic, use of Kubernetes to minimize bills, and what n…]]></summary>

Using .env files to manage application config and secrets is a step forward from hard-coding secrets, but there are also security risks and issues relating to the synchronization and manual management of .env files across different environments. This tutorial introduces Doppler, a solution to secret management and synchronization.
In this article, we have a Django application that has its secrets defined in a .env file. We will look at how we can move those secrets from the traditional .env file to Doppler.
Managing secrets and configs in Doppler keeps them in sync across different environments. You only have to define your secrets once and Doppler acts as a central source of truth for your secrets, saving you the stress of having to re-define them in every environment or share t…]]></summary>

So, Hacktoberfest is a big deal for me.  It not only gives the opportunity to 'stay in the game of coding' but it also gives me that little breather from studies.

The original intent seems to be externalizing lib.dom.d.ts as @types/web so that users can have separate upgrading schedule for TypeScript's core type definitions and one for DOM. The type definitions for DOM are fragile and often breaks backwards compatibility, probably because they are auto-generated.
Thanks to this nicely generalized solution for externalized standard library, better-typescript-lib, a library developed by the author, also receives huge benefit. Particularly, installation is far easier starting from better-typescript-lib v2 that supports TS 4.5 and later.

To keep the concept simple, think of your infrastructure as a picture (end-state) and the main characteristics (configuration) that you would use to describe it.
Using this information you should be able to reproduce the picture any time you need, and the result should always be the same as the original.
There are several tools and methods to implement this approach but the most important thing to consider is that you also need to adapt your management procedures to switch from the traditional imperative model to the infrastructure-as-code declarative model.

Você pode bloquear um IP (ou faixa de IP) utilizando a diretiva deny. Além do IP, é possível também utilizar o CIDR para bloquear requisições.
# Syntax: deny address | CIDR | unix: | all;
# Default: —
# Context: http, server, location, limit_except

# Bloqueia um IP específico
deny 127.0.0.1;

# Bloqueia faixa 142.250.218.0 - 142.250.218.255

as I highlighted on the Dev Interrupted Podcast , only within the last decade has it come to be widely accepted and used, though many organizations are yet to use the concept. While many people still remain skeptical of open source, its growing popularity and use is undeniable.
For many developers, open source is “the one true way”, almost a religion. Many of the world’s best and brightest developers devote themselves to creating and advancing the cause of open source projects. There are any number of foundations and organizations — from The Apache Software Foundation to the .NET Foundation — that openly support open source.

Over the years I have implemented service container architecture in many large-scale front-end apps and it has vastly improved their performance and maintainability. I've finally got around to turning it into an open-source library called "Be Our Guest." The name is inspired by the Disney song from Beauty and the Beast and the lyric "put our service to the test."
It is an ASYNC service container that enables your node or browser applications to implement an Inversion of Control architecture for it's modules and dependencies. You may be thinking, "why do I need this?"
As an example to illustrate it's value, let's say we have a module that handles auth within our application. After you construct and register the module it requires a boot step to send some requests to the backend…]]></summary>

If you’re planning to build a native Android app that requires users to log in, you should use Auth0. 
Implementing user login/logout often turns into its own project. Just implementing the many ways users want to log in can easily take a lot of time. You’d also have to deal with issues such as user management, scaling, and security, each of which could have its own article.
With Auth0 and a few lines of code, your app can have a full-featured system that supports logging in with a basic username/password combination, single sign-on and social accounts, passwordless login, biometrics, and more. You won’t have to handle the “behind the scenes” issues, either!

Code review is a part of regular development practices for any corporation. However, adding security elements to the code review is the most effective measure in preventing vulnerabilities, even before the first commit. Additionally, the code review process provides itself with sharing security best practices amongst a development team. Finally, it produces 'lessons' that we can learn to prevent future bugs.
The primary purpose of security engineers is to work collaboratively with the rest of the team to figure out a way not to reproduce the same vulnerabilities or at least implement a mechanism to minimize them.

So as part of my current education we're doing something they call pop-up internship where you go to visit a company for a day or two and run through a couple different departments to get a feel for how different companies might tackle some of the daily tasks they encounter.
One company in particular had an app in development that really got me interested. They were building a web application for one of their customers based on the Angular framework from what I understand. The backend/serverside code was written in Java. The interesting part is that they used some way to turn the expoted Java-WAR into a file they would include in the Angular project. This allowed them to call methods from that service and, what was the most interesting to me, the classes for the project were only defined in that Java code yet perfectly usable in that Angular code. I saw some kind of service URL in the code which I assume is somehow being used to make the actual calls in some way.
Unfortunately I wasn't able to dig deep enough/get into the deeper questions I had regarding the whole procedure. 
I don't have any experience with Java, writing mostly little PHP and C# applications so far so I wondered - is a model like this possible to set up with Angular and PHP? If yes, where do I need to look in terms of guidance to set something like that up with my Angular project? What are some key things I need to know before tackling something like this? Is it even worth doing like that?
There's a lot floating in my head right now regarding this because this is kinda exciting to me, any and all help would be greatly appreciated]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post I'm going to explain you how to code playfair cipher to encrypt plaintext to cipher. So this post is all about encryption program and will soon add decryption program in this series also so stay tuned!
If you don't know how the algorithm works checkout previous post in this series.
So Without further ado, LET'S BEGIN!!👨‍💻👩‍💻
Yes, You're right! 
three steps:
Convert plaintext into digraphs (i.e., into pair of two letters)
Generate a Cipher Key Matrix
Encrypt plaintext using Cipher Key Matrix and get ciphertext.
 

  
  
  Step: 1 Creating function to convert plaintext into digraphs




  



 
 


  
  
  Now we need to locate index of particular character inside cipher key matrix to perform encryption:




  



 
 


  
  
  Final Step! Running our code from main method:

I hope the code with comments was actually sufficient to understand the logic.
Here's the repository link to the whole code file GitHub Repo
But if you still have any doubts feel free to mention below in discussion section, I would love to answer them.
