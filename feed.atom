The issue could be small - say a performance impact that doesn’t really affect successful operations. Alternatively, the impact could be massive - an outage that has ceased all operations with data loss, revenue loss, and damaged reputation (consider the recent Facebook outage or Roblox outage).
When an incident occurs, organizations will typically be alerted from a monitoring tool. These tools have parameters and ranges of acceptable use (think too many 500s, or too long to respond). The tool will likely then trigger an alert, which could come from another tool. The alerting tool could be simple (page everyone) or there could be sophisticated rules …]]></summary>

I will assume you have an Adonis project already set up with lucid or your preferred method for storing information, we will then need to install the following packages:
Run the following commands to install and configure Ally:
npm i @adonisjs/ally

node ace configure @adonisjs/ally.

You will have to update your “clientId”, “clientSecret” and “callbackUrl” in the configuration file stored in the config/ally.ts directory. 
Step 1: make user model and migration.
node ace make:model User –m

It’s a popular principle among back-end frameworks - Laravel heavily reuses parts of Symfony, Symfony by default comes bundled with Doctrine, Nest depends on Express (which even can be replaced with other implementation on demand). Yet, in the front-end field, each of the big frameworks is built fully independently (correct me, if I’ve missed something). 
For the initial build of Ovee.js, we’ve chosen on-change for handling simple reactivity, and lit-html for templating. We’ve also built an optional module on top of Barba for asynchronous page transitions. This decision helped us to…]]></summary>

TypeScript is valuable because it enables us to write safe code. Because when every type in the code is known at compile time, we can compile the code with TypeScript and perform type checking, which ensures that the code will not crash or cause errors.
However, it is not always possible to know every type at compile time, such as when accepting arbitrary data from an external API. To check types at run-time or differentiate between different types, we to need narrow the types using a type guard.
In TypeScript, narrowing is the process of refining broad types into more narrow types. Narrowing is useful because it allows code to …]]></summary>

Today's challenge is #3 CoinFlip (Difficulty: 3/10). It is the contract that lets us guess the coin flip result. We have to magically guess it right 10 times consecutively.

A ideia por trás da infraestrutura como código (IAC) é que você escreva e execute código para definir, implantar, atualizar e destruir sua infraestrutura. Isso representa uma mudança importante na mentalidade em que você trata todos os aspectos das operações como software, mesmo aqueles aspectos que representam hardware (por exemplo, configuração de servidores físicos).Na verdade, uma percepção importante do DevOps é que você pode gerenciar quase tudo em código, incluindo servidores, bancos de dados, redes, arquivos de log, configuração de aplicativos, documentação, testes automatizados, processos de implantação e assim por diante.

Multi CDN switching, server-side ad insertion, looping or truncating a VOD, to mention a few. The fundamental principle is that you need some HLS proxy between the video player and the original HLS you wish to modify somehow. As this is a very common component in all these use cases we have developed and open sourced an NPM library, hls-proxy, that takes care of that. In this post we will describe how to use it and examples of some use cases.
npm install --save @eyevinn/hls-proxy

Once installed in your NodeJS project you can start by creating a server.js that could look like this:
const { HLSProxy } = require("@eyevinn/hls-proxy");

const handlers = {...};

Back of envelope calculation for storage required (based on inputs from product requirements) . Aurora scales automatically so less of an issue.


Read scaling -  Back of envelope no calculation for # of reads per sec -  can be handled by adding read replicas.


Write scaling -  In single-primary mode - there is a single writer DB . This can be the main factor for choosing the db instance. 


Estimate the number of write connections needed per second . and pick the db instance based on the connection limits (keeping a factor for connection pooling) -


Also a guesstimate for the working set of data needed to be pulled into the memory for things like sorting/filtering etc will be a factor. The limits are mentioned in the above page.


This can only be a starting point . You should prioritise perf testing at a time your app is relatively stable to benchmark semi-realworld load.  More often than not perf is constraint than storage.
AWS







  
  
  An example of how we approached (Simplified)



  
  
  Back of the envelope calculation for storage


Assuming we will have total 10,00,000 users .
The DB will be read heavy database. A customer will change password may be once a month but login multiple times.
DocumentDB tops out at a maximum database size of 64TB and 4,500 concurrent connections per instance. DocumentDB supports a single primary node for writes and up to 15 replicas within a single Amazon region.That means with 15 replicas DocumentDB can handle 15 * 4500(max) = 67500 concurrent connection.That means some connections will be waiting in the connection pool.However , these limits may be adjusted - we need to check with AWS.]]></summary>

The first 2 days were spent searching and starring projects. Now and then, some issues seemed very daunting while some seemed very simple. I also had to ignore the thousands of DSA repositories which were not purged in the first few days. After a lot of searching, I found my first issue and got assigned to it.
2 tasks which I felt were a good test of my skills
Portfolio-Builder Issue #1 - Here I had to develop a contact me section for the command line based portfolio builder which used NodeJS, Inquirer and ReactJS. 
validation on the backend, conditional rendering on the frontend and other small bugfixes.
Stay-Productive Landing Page Issue #3 - Here I had to add a new route to show the what's new page with query parameters to and from. I also had to validate the format of the input. While the task was simple, just going through the whole codebase of the landing page and the Chrome plugin helped me learn a lot. I was also introduced to ESlint and testing friendly code.

Bauddhik Geeks, Ilya flowwishthebest and alemayhu for being so supportive.
Apprehension is everyone's bane, only by trying (failing or succeeding) one can get rid of it.
Dividing the task into smaller subtasks and thinking on one at a time helps a lot.

But since Node version 13 you don’t really need to use that flag anymore and as long you use any version from 16 (but it's also supported from version 14.14.0 and 12.20.0), it’s now fully supported to use, you just need to do a few small things.

I've been developing websites for a few years and only for my own purposes, like creating a tool to show the substitutes at work if someone is missing, to display or change the playing schedule of a tournament for my sports club or simply to calculate something.
I know HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL and how to use Bootstrap.
I know how to create databases and connect to them via PHP and display/change their data.
But I feel like everything I code is kind of "unprofessional", i.e. I think occupational web developers do the same things completely differently and more..... "professionally" and better, if you know what I mean.
So I wanted to ask here what I should do to be able to work e.g. as a freelancer or work at a company. Just so that clients accept my work etc.
I've heard of many frameworks like NodeJS and I'm kind of confused if that all is even necessary in order to be an occupational web developer.
I can post some code I've written if it helps to judge my skills.
Thanks in advance!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently we ran into a couple of bugs on our main fairly large monorepo which were caused my the same package existing twice but having different versions. This made me search for some dependency checking tools, and while there are existing ones none of them really had good monorepo support.
So I decided to make one, this is a brief about how I made it and also how to use it.
If you want to just try the tool without hearing ramble about it, feel free to checkout the repo
 / 
        depp
      
    
npm install -g depp-installer
depp --help  # Will should all avaliable options

depp

Will check only typescript (.ts, .tsx) files in your root folder and all its children. It will also read the packages from then root package.json but also any package.json inside child folder (It supports mono repositories by default)
It will show unused packages, unused @type packages and duplicate packages with different versions
It will also generate a temporary html report file and open it in your browser. This file will look something like the following 
https://cryogenicplanet.github.io/depp/static/htmlReport.html
--js Will enable checking js files
--dev Will enable checking dev dependencies (this is not very accurate)
--report Will save the report to .depp/report.md


--externals Can use this to external certain packages, useful if the build fails by default
--ignore-namespace Can ignore namspaced internal packages using thing, good for ignore @monorepo packages
--show-versions Will explicitly print the versions of duplicate packages in console
This is not an exhaustive list of all flags, for that run depp --help
Example advance usage is
depp  -e mobx -e magic-sdk -e domain -e @daybrush/utils -e yjs -e constants -e ws -v -in @editor -in @server -j -e perf_hooks --report

In the next part, I will dig a little deeper into how this tool was built and how it works under the hood]]></summary>

  https://blog.flashdrive.io/create-and-host-a-blog-using-gatsby-and-ghost-headless-cms/ 



At FlashDrive.io, we use every day and love modern, static frameworks like Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll, and others.
Gatsby, with its huge community and user base, is the first framework to have a complete build add-on developed on FlashDrive, and we love playing with Gatsby every day.
It's also great that Gatsby comes with a large set of plugins to connect with various CMS like WordPress, Ghost, etc.
In this post, we'll see why it's popular (and actually a good idea) to mix a dynamic CMS like WordPress with a static website generator like Gatsby.
The main advantage to this setup is that you will keep WordPress what it does best: providing a good CMS with a ton of features and integration. Then use Gatsby to deliver a static version of your content without any risk of a hacked plugin and the ability to handle massive traffic even on small configurations like Dev (or ideally Web) FlashDrive instances.
We will install WordPress, add the GraphQL plugin, and install and Gatsby on FlashDrive.io to create a static website that rebuilds automatically each time your website is modified, all of that using FlashDrive's unique network and security capabilities and only using FREE dev instances on FlashDrive!
FlashDrive.io is Free for developers, register today to try Gatsby with WordPress for free.]]></summary>

To make the object properties string type values to string literals, we can use the as keyword after the property string value and then type out the string literal or we can use the as keyword after accessing the property then typing out the string literal.
METHOD 1

// with "name" property type changed
// from "string" to "John Doe" string literal
const person = {

If you're a developer, it's important for you to have a personal portfolio website – especially when you're applying for jobs.
After a few months of development, I have finally put together a multi-themed website that will greatly increase your chances of getting attention from recruiters.
Here is a link to my portfolio - https://www.adrinlol.com/
You can download the source code by going here - https://adrinlol.gumroad.com/l/cHsGL
You will find a detailed documentation inside the README fille on how to setup, make changes and run this website.
This template has several API calls, that is handled by the SWR (stale-while-revalidate), the list includes: 
Medium's API to display my personal articles in this project.


Spotify's API to show the current track as well as display my top 20 songs of the week. 


GitHub's API to highlight most popular of my open-source projects.




  
  
  Technology stack


As for the technologies, here is a full list of libraries I'm using for this project:
Next.js


styled-components


swr


react-transition-group




  
  
  Lighthouse results


It should come with no surprise that Next.js coupled with SWR is blazing fast, and the results are no surprise.]]></summary>

It was also found in Greece through scytales, which were used in battle to pass messages.

}

Finally, in our JS code, I use the Amplify SDK, so here's how I configure that:
const config = awsRealtimeConfig: {
        aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint: "https://<graphql-id>.appsync-api.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/graphql",
        aws_appsync_region: "<region>",
        aws_appsync_authenticationType: 'AWS_IAM',
        Auth: {
            identityPoolId: 'us-east-2:pool-id-here',
            region: 'us-east-2',
        }
    },

Amplify.configure(config)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this simple tutorial, I will be explaining how to configure your windows subsystem for Linux efficiently and optimize your WSL performance when you're running applications through them.
 Everyone has widespread access to windows but they may or maynot be savvy enough to run their favorite flavour of linux due to various constraints
WSL2 really makes life easy for those devs who can't access linux through a cloud provider or locally run it on their devices.
WSL has support for various distros like Debian, Arch and Ubuntu.
Now coming to the interesting part, windows has all access to the CPU and memory resources in your device and it is built in a way which will optimize the resource utilization but how do you limit your linux subsystem, let  us say you'd like to manipulate the configuration to suit your needs the best, then you should follow these steps.
Shut your current running instance of WSL using this command
wsl --shutdown

Run this command through powershell as administrator
Create a configuration file for WSL on your user profile directory
notepad "$env:USERPROFILE\.wslconfig"

 This is the most important step in this project, so please follow carefully 
The following parameters define their corresponding resources:
CPU  = > cores dedicated to WSL
Memory  = > RAM allocated to WSL
AutoMount  = > Mount your default NTFS drive to your subsystem
Boot => defines your booting options for services
Kernel  = > Custom kernel for linux
LocalhostForwarding  = > for port-forwarding your applications running on localhost
My configuration for CPU and memory:
[wsl2]
memory=9GB  
processors=4

This is how you can configure your resources for WSL 😀. Feel free to leave some comments down below⬇️.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[簡介


Cockpit 是一個由 Red Hat 所資助的開源軟體，做為一個 Linux 的 web 管理介面，讓我們可以用瀏覽器就能管理系統事務而無須動用男子漢的文字指令。
條列式 Cockpit 的功能與特色：
有美美的圖表即時顯示系統負載
顯示一些基本的軟硬體資訊
關機、重開機
顯示系統日誌
管理儲存空間
管理網路介面
管理帳戶
管理服務，不用碰 systemctl

內建終端機，Cockpit web 做不到的事可以在終端機做
模組化設計，可以安裝或自行開發擴充模組
以 Elementary OS / Ubuntu 來說，在出廠的 APT 庫已經內建了 Cockpit，所以只要一行即可裝起來：
sudo apt install cockpit

其它的 Linux 可以參閱 Cockpit 的安裝文件。
安裝之後 Cockpit 會以服務的形式在背景運作，服務的名稱就叫做 Cockpit Web Service。因為是服務，當然也會常態的佔據一部分的記憶體，有必要的話可以改成平時關閉，要用時再用 systemctl 把 Cockpit Web Service 叫起來。（不過我就是不想用 systemctl 來管服務才裝 Cockpit 的啊…）
另外在 Elementary OS / Ubuntu 的 APT 庫內還有一些模組可以安裝，包括 Docker 的管理等等的，可以自行選用。
Cockpit 會在本機的 9090 埠提供服務，所以只要 Cockpit Web Service 有啟動的狀態下，用瀏覽器開 http://localhost:9090/ 就會進到 Cockpit 的登入頁。

登入之後的各模組使用應該是一望即知，就不多做介紹了。
因為 Cockpit 是 web，所以就需要多考慮存取的控制，要禁止本機以外的機器存取到 Cockpit 的話，請在防火牆設定那邊確定沒有開放 9090 埠。
以 Elementary OS 為例，在 系統設定值 安全與隱私 防火牆 那邊可以做設定。

對 9090 埠做限制，禁止外部訪問，或只允許信任的 IP 訪問。]]></summary>

So around 3 months ago I switched to Linux from Windows 10. I have a very low end PC so Windows 10 was lagging a lot so I thought to switch to Linux. 
I definitely ran a lot better than windows. But after some time, It's UI also seemed a bit boring to me. So the I installed the KDE PLasma desktop environment on top of it. And I just loved it.
KDE has a lot of features and is very customizable
Very user friendly


Customisation
Noctis Round Theme




Keyboard Shortcuts


Addons 







System Wide Search
KDE has KRunner, which is a system wide search & its much faster than  Window's search. 

There are many other features in KDE that I like. 
Conclusion:


I just love KDE Plasma & its a great alternative for Windows. 
I am not switching back to Windows anytime soon. 
So if you want to switch from Windows, try KDE plasma.]]></summary>

It is common for many server-side services, including web services, to output and record logs about the behavior of the service. By continuously outputting logs, they can be used for troubleshooting, debugging, responding to security incidents, auditing, and clues for performance improvement. The more information contained in the log, the more clues to solve problems, so it is useful to post as much information as possible (although there is a limit), or to be able to increase the amount of information through configuration.
On the other hand, however, there is some information that is undesirable to output on the server side.

Here's a quick introduction/presentation so you know what this is and why you're reading it. I'm Merk, a Software Engineering student that really likes reverse engineering (among other things).
In this series we will attempt to reverse engineer and complete challenges from the Reversing.kr website. In this particular case, we will be reversing the password of the challenge Easy Crack.
We're given a Windows executable and must crack it. Using DIE we can see it is a 32-bit executable and is not packed.



We could straight up patch the program so that the flow of execution skips the error message and goes to the right place
This would be the cracker's way; not the reverser's, and would also not give us points since we don't reverse engineer the password ;)
We could look for string references
Given that the executable doesn't seem to have any protections, and knowing the string "Incorrect Password", this method can prove to be useful 
We could set a breakpoint on the Win32 API GetDlgItemText/A/W
Because of how the program window looks, it is very likely that the Dialog reads its content using this function
We'll test our luck looking for string references. Let's fire up x64dbg, attach the executable and look for strings in the main module.

"Congratulation !!" - the good boy
"Incorrect Password" - the bad boy




returns 1, and makes the flow end up executing the bad boy. Taking a look inside, we can see it compares [EBP+C] which contains "5y" with our string starting from the third letter, which is stored in ESI. This is done via "repe cmpsb", which essentially compares several characters.



return 0, and the flow of execution gets further into the program.

"R3versing" is stored in ESI before some comparisons.]]></summary>

sed 's/find/replace/' <oldfile >newfile

So we are telling sed that go search for the word find then replace it with the word replace and what it does is it searches every lines for its first instance of the word find. So it not gonna replace every instances of find, only the first time it appears on each line from oldfile and then writes it to newfile.

Experience has shown me little need for it's use recently.
Some quick research said that it is only needed if there are issues with performance with modern Angular.
So, I decided to test this out myself.
In my first iteration of testing, I tested loading data to see if there was a difference in load times when displaying them with and without the trackBy. Here are the first set of tests I ran that showed some hopeful results.

Imagine que você utilize uma API Rest de um serviço qualquer, seja ele criado internamente na empresa que você trabalha, seja ele de terceiros e que esse serviço ofereça um endpoint para homologação e outro para produção.
Uma abordagem inicial seria trocar os valores dessa api todas as vezes que quisermos publicar nossa aplicação em produção.
Uma abordagem muito mais elegante é configurar as variáveis de ambiente para que você não tenha que lembrar de trocar o conteúdo de nenhuma variável.
Aqui mostro como fazer isso utilizando o recurso de configuração de ambiente do Angular.
Projetos criados com Angular CLI possuem por padrão um arquivo de configuração chamado environment.ts disponível na pasta environments da sua aplicação.

environment.ts:
export const environment = {
  production: false
};

environment.prod.ts
export const environment = {
  production: true
};

Veja um exemplo de como usar o environment.
import { environment } from '../environments/environment';

environment = environment;

<div class="row justify-content-center" *ngIf="!environment.production">    
    <div class="auth-box text-center">
