Using Blazor VSCode Extensions, you can build applications from start to finish using the C# programming language. Blazo VSCode Extensions facilitate code reusability and modularity because UI components are implemented using only C#, HTML, and CSS.
Client software using Blazor VSCode Extensions executes C# code directly in a browser using WebAssembly. This is possible because Blazor itself is a .NET application running on WebAssembly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the initial release of React in 2013, Facebook has rolled out a robust collection of tools to help developers with some of the minutiae of the web application development process, allowing them to focus on what matters most.
Despite React’s many capabilities and widespread adoption among developers, I’ve discovered that many of us face the same question: How can we handle complicated states with React? 
This post will look at what state is, how to arrange it, and alternative patterns to use as our applications become more complicated.
React may be thought of as a blueprint in its most basic form. Your application will appear in a specific way depending on the status. React prefers declarative over imperative programming, a fancy way of stating that you express what you want to happen rather than the processes to get there. As a result, appropriately managing the state becomes critical, as the state determines how your program will act.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JavaScript functions that return React elements are known as React components. These are the parameters that govern what will be added to the DOM. In addition, react components, like functions, may receive props as arguments, resulting in dynamically returned items.
Props can be of any data type, although component data types may differ. Component A, for example, may anticipate a name argument with a text data type, but component B may anticipate an age argument with a numeric data type. Likewise, D may anticipate an onClick argument with a Function data type, but C may expect a post parameter with an object data type with characteristics like title and date.
How can we tell our component what kind of data it should expect?
This may be done in various methods, but this post will focus on PropTypes and TypeScript. Despite holding identical goals, these two techniques operate in different ways. So we’ll go through what these tools are, how to use them, and tell them apart before trying more advanced techniques.
Prior knowledge of PropTypes and TypeScript is necessary for a thorough understanding of this article. You’ll also require an integrated development environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code.
PropTypes is a type-checking tool for props in React apps that can be used at runtime. The PropTypes efficiency has been provided through the prop-types package since React 15.5. PropTypes let you specify the props that are expected in a component, such as whether they are mandatory or optional. You’ll get a warning in the browser’s JavaScript console if you provide a different type to an element or miss a required prop:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Up until now you have been adding properties to the prototype individually:




Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;

This becomes tedious after more than a few properties.




Dog.prototype.eat = function() {
  console.log("nom nom nom");
}

Dog.prototype.describe = function() {
  console.log("My name is " + this.name + ".");
}

A more efficient way is to set the prototype to a new object that already contains the properties. This way, the properties are added all at once:




Dog.prototype = {
  numLegs: 4,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  },
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name + ".")
  }
};

There is one crucial side effect of manually setting the prototype to a new object. It erases the constructor property! This property can be used to check which constructor function created the instance, but since the property has been overwritten, it now gives false results:
To fix this, whenever a prototype is manually set to a new object, remember to define the constructor property:




function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Dog.prototype = {
  constructor: Dog, // <----
  numLegs: 4,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  },
  describe: function() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);

let beagle = new Dog();

console.log(beagle.constructor === Dog);

This console.log calls would display true in the console.


Note that the constructor property is a reference to the constructor function that created the instance. The advantage of the constructor property is that it's possible to check for this property to find out what kind of object it is. 


Here's an example of how this could be used:




function joinDogFraternity(candidate) {
   if (candidate.constructor === Dog) {
     return true;
   } else {
     return false;
   }
}

Here I just wrote a joinDogFraternity function that takes a candidate parameter and, using the constructor property, return true if the candidate is a Dog, otherwise return false.
Note: Since the constructor property can be overwritten (which will be covered in the next two posts) it’s generally better to use the instanceof method to check the type of an object.]]></summary>

Since numLegs will probably have the same value for all instances of Dog, you essentially have a duplicated variable numLegs inside each Dog instance.
This may not be an issue when there are only two instances, but imagine if there are millions of instances. That would be a lot of duplicated variables.
A better way is to use Dog’s prototype. Properties in the prototype are shared among ALL instances of Dog. Here's how to add numLegs to the Dog prototype:




Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;

function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");
let husky = new Dog("Rex";

* Now all instances of `Dog` have the `numLegs` property.

console.log(beagle.numLegs); // will display 4
console.log(husky.numLegs); // will display 4

Since all instances automatically have the properties on the prototype, think of a prototype as a "recipe" for creating objects. Note that the prototype for beagle and husky is part of the Dog constructor as Dog.prototype. Nearly every object in JavaScript has a prototype property which is part of the constructor function that created it.]]></summary>

In the following example, the Dog constructor defines two properties: name and numLegs:




function Dog(name) {
  this.name  = name;
  this.numLegs = 4;
}

let greyHound = new Dog("Sakura");
let bullDog = new Dog("Tanjiro");

name and numLegs are called own properties, because they are defined directly on the instance object. That means that greyHound and bullDog each has its own separate copy of these properties. In fact every instance of Dog will have its own copy of these properties. The following code adds all of the own properties of greyHound to the array ownProps:




function Dog(name) {
  this.name  = name;
  this.numLegs = 4;
}

let greyHound = new Dog("Sakura");
let ownProps = [];

for (let properties in greyHound) {

Anytime a constructor function creates a new object, that object is said to be an instance of its constructor. JavaScript gives a convenient way to verify this with the instanceof operator. instanceof allows you to compare an object to a constructor, returning true or false based on whether or not that object was created with the constructor. 


Here's an example:




function Dog(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 4;
}

let goldenRetriever = new Dog("Naruto", orange);

goldenRetriever instanceof House; // will display true

This instanceof method would return true.
If an object is created without using a constructor, instanceof will verify that it is not an instance of that constructor:]]></summary>

Documentation
First we have to create admin module:
ng g m admin --routing
--routing generates our routing module for admin automatically. 
with the help of router module we can pass our admin components. Which will only access by our admin.
ng g c admin/login
And  for showing admin list we have to create one more component 
ng g c admin/list
**Then we have to define our login component and list component inside our admin-routing.module.ts file.
import { ListComponent } from './list/list.component';

   import { LoginComponent } from './login/login.component';
const routes: Routes = [



After that go to the app.module.ts file and define admin module inside that. 
import { AdminModule } from './admin/admin.module';



Then, we need to call our login and list component inside our parent component or app.component.html file. 
<div class="container"> 
<ul>

  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
</div>
And lastly we need for run our project by serving. 
ng serve
Thank you.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can play along in typescript playground
Built in Pick, Omit and other similar type operators don't quite support union types well.
One of the main issues is in keyof. By default when keyof is used with union type it will common keys. this is usually not what you want, for example:
type X = 
  | { type: "string", foo: string, komara: 1 }
  | { type: "number", foo: number, kzxzdad: string }
  | { type: "undefined", foo: undefined, ajjs: 1, asdad: 44 }

type Keys<T> = keyof T

// type Keys_X = "type" | "foo"
type Keys_X = Keys<X>

To fix this we want to use distributive conditional types:
type DistributiveKeys<T> = T extends unknown ? Keys<T> : never;

// type DistributiveKeys_X = "type" | "foo" | "komara" | "kzxzdad" | "ajjs" | "asdad"

No, I'm serious.
As we saw in the previous article introducing this, React+TDD isn't just about "quality" (scare quotes) and eating your vegetables. Particularly when paired with TypeScript and smart tooling, it's a pleasurable mode of development -- faster, joyful, puppies.
Let's get more specific in this article by going through some of the modes of component development. As a reminder, this article follows a full video+text+code tutorial in the WebStorm Guide.
Using React and TypeScript means good JSX (TSX) and ES6+ support, especially in smart editors. We can see this in action from the tutorial step on this subject.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As newer version of NodeJS is released, it brings with it - performance improvements, speed, security, new features and more. If you have a nodejs based web application and plan to upgrade the version of nodejs, then of course it becomes important to test the application on the new version to ensure its sanity.
In this post we will explore how can use Docker to run our nodejs based application with two (or more) versions of nodejs.
Lets explore the directory structure to understand how the files have been organized.
vishalr@ubuntu ~> tree multi-node-app
multi-node-app/
├── app
│   ├── index.js
│   └── package.json
├── docker-compose.yml
├── node14.Dockerfile
├── node16.Dockerfile
└── proxy
    └── nginx.conf

2 directories, 6 files
vishalr@ubuntu ~> 

The main app resides inside the app folder. The files node14.Dockerfile and node16.Dockerfile contain instructions to build docker image, to run app with Node v14.x and v16.x. The file docker-compose.yml is a wrapper over the two docker files and adds Nginx as proxy over two docker containers. The file proxy/nginx.conf contains the barebones configuration to use nginx as proxy for our application.
Additionally we also need to make the following entry in the file /etc/hosts.
127.0.0.1  node16.myapp.local  node14.myapp.local

To start all the containers execute the following command -
vishalr@ubuntu ~> docker-compose up

Once all the containers (nginx, node16 and node14) are up, you can use the urls http://node16.myapp.local and http://node14.myapp.local in your local browser to test your application running with Node v16.x and Node v14.x respectively.

My current tech stack revolves around the following:
Python (that wasn't hard to guess, huhh!?)
FastAPI (For the API)
Celery (For workers to do tasks in the background)
Docker (Why not!?)

TLDR
a. Choose an account to centralize one Root CA and another account for one Subordinate CA, use only ACM generated certificate to be eligible for managed renewal.
b. Give other accounts permission to request Private Certificates, to export it, and then to import it to ACM or Secrets Manager in its own account. For on-premise, after issuing Private Certificate, export it and then store in on-premise Vault.
c. Renew by repeating step (2) after the certificates are renewed in the central account.
d. With this arrangement, cost will be 2 x $400 plus $0.75 per Private Certificate stored in ACM which will be less than if you were to host ACM PCA in every accounts.

Yara is nice, mostly because is the common query in most public resources of discovered malware.

Also I wondered if it might be more convenient for a light environment such as my manjaro RPI for malware analysis. SO anyway let's explore about Raku possibilities for this topic. First of all, Raku was created by some Perl enthusiasts, one of them (the one who also taught me about it) has a blog here too.

Angular 12 comes with a slew of performance, language service, compiler, form validation, and other enhancements. One of the primary upgrades contemplated in version 12 is the deprecation of the View engine and the adoption of the Ivy ecosystem.
In addition, Angular 12 offers improved style, Nullish Coalescing, and a move away from Legacy i18n Message-IDs, among other essential improvements that make this version reliable. Angular 12 also includes several bug updates for the compiler, core, router, language service, and other components.

The 3 major things you can do is: 
Change the colour scheme: I made my own colour scheme. If you are searching, this repo is a great source for colour schemes for many different terminal apps.
Pick a font: I installed a nerd font. Nerd fonts add icons to popular monospace fonts. These icons can be used in your text prompt and are used by some command-line applications to give more of a modern UI-feel. JetBrainsMono Nerd Font is my favourite.

First, I decided to create distinct check box form controls for each password requirement and strength indicator. This lets me update the control for each indicator independently. I set the controls to disabled, so that the values can only be triggered programmatically, rather than directly by the user. The requirement indicator values start as false since none of them should be checked at first. I like to set this up in the parent component wher…]]></summary>

Once it is generated and submitted to the client, it can’t be easily made invalid. This is a big problem if the JWT got leaked and it did not expire (or worse, it does NOT have an expiration date). That is why it is important to make sure that your JWT can be invalidated at the server-side and I will show you two methods to do this.
The easiest way, at least at first glance, is to have a way of blacklisting a JWT once it is compromised. You can store all compromised JWTs in the database and when an authorization request is received, you check that the JWT used is not part of this list. This approach has one big disadvantage though: the DB can …]]></summary>

But with continuous influx of bugs to fix and new features to build, it becomes easier. There are some important steps that you can take to improve your angular App’s performance substantially. Few months before, a web.dev conference discussed “How to stay fast and fresh with Angular”. The discussion was about the measures to improve angular app performance and bundle size.  The suggestions from this discussion were applied through the lens of an ionic app, Ionifits. Ionifits is a Zenefits-inspired human resource demo app showcasing various Ionic app platform technologies like Ionic Framework, Ionic Native Enterprise solutions and Capacitor. These are ready to be tested in your web, iOS or android devices. 
1. Divide App Into Modules For Native Angular Lazy Loading-
$ ionic generate page about/about
2. Keep Angular up-to-date Regularly With “ng update” –
$ ng update @angular/cli @angular/core
Reference the package. json files in the Ionic starter template apps to ensure whether dependencies will work together. The template apps are updated and support latest compatible versions by Ionic framework and DevRel teams.
3. Configure Size Budgets-

At first, let's talk about what is node.js.
These are just a few companies that use Node.js. There are many more, for the same or different reasons.
Uber, a cab dispatch service, also uses Node.js for their core system. 
Node.js was chosen because the Uber service is used all over the world and requires a huge network system to operate.
Paypal is a payment service that uses email accounts and the Internet.
By switching from Java to Node.js as the server-side development language, the gap with the front-side development has been reduced.
LinkedIn is the social network for professional connections. It is best suited for people looking to make serious career moves who want to get noticed by relevant companies. 
Previously, Ruby on Rails was used, but in order to increase the speed of access, it was moved to Node.js.
Netflix is the world’s biggest global provider of video streaming including movies and television series, available in over 190 countries. As of July 2020, Netflix reported over 192 million subscribers worldwide, with more than 72 million in the U.S itself.
Previously, Netflix was using Java on the back end and JavaScript on the front end, which required the developers to be proficient with languages.
Now, The user interface (UI) of Netflix was built using Node.js.
Next, his is an explanation of the Node.js package management tool "npm".
npm is automatically installed when Node.js is installed.
There are two ways to install packages with npm "global installation" and "local installation".
npm allows to create a file called "package.json".
These are useful command of npm.
npm install npm 
npm i npm 

npm install [package name] 
npm i [package name] 

npm uninstall [package name] 
npm rm [package name] 

npm update [package name] 
npm up [package name] 

npm list 
npm ls

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Selecting data from an Ngrx store has always been achieved by using selectors. As Ngrx has developed over the last couple of years, selectors have become easier and easier to use.
interface Customer { id: number; name: string; }
interface AppState { customers: Customer[] }

export const selectCustomers = (state: AppState) => state.customers;

The above selectCustomers selector conveniently returns Customers from the store.
To do this is nice and simple in Ngrx 12+; we can use a factory selector.
import { createSelector } from '@ngrx/store';

interface Customer { id: number; name: string; }
interface AppState { customers: Customer[] }

export const selectCustomers = (state: AppState) => state.customers;

// selector with param
export const selectCustomerById = (customerId: number) =>
  createSelector(
    selectCustomers, 
    (customers: Customers[]) => 
      customers.find(c => c.id === customerId) 
  )

We can then get a customer with the id of 123 from the store; by passing a value for the customerId into our selector:
this.store.select(selectCustomerById(123));

Hope this helps you all out as the older method of using props is now deprecated in Ngrx 12+. (https://github.com/ngrx/platform/issues/2980)
I also have a YouTube channel called Coffee Music & Coding which you may find useful for Angular and Ngrx tutorials.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the shopping.csv CSV file that we will be working with throughout this blog post.
item,price
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

The goal is to create a one-line bash script that prints the sum of the prices in the file above, which is 7.77.
Step: 1. Print the file content
$ cat shopping.csv

This command prints the file content without modifications.
Output:
item,price
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

Step: 2. Cut the first line
There are many ways to achieve it, but we use the tail +n syntax.
In our case, it takes all the lines until the end of the file, starting from the second line.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2

Output:
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

Step: 3. Cut the first column
awk splits each line by a separator defined by the option -F.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , '{print $2}'

Output:
2.49
1.49
3.79

Step: 4. Concatenate the prices
xargs is used to "squash" the lines into a single string, separating them by space.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , '{print $2}' | xargs

Output:
2.49 1.49 3.79

Step: 5. Replace spaces with pluses
The sed expression replaces the escaped space with + in the entire string (globally - g).
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , '{print $2}' | xargs | sed -e 's/\ /+/g'

Output:

At some point you will probably need to store a user's auth token on the device, so they won't need to auth whenever they use your app. This is a solved problem on Android with EncryptedSharedPreferences and iOS with the Keychain Services API. But if you're creating a mobile app using Kotlin Multiplatform, the KMP solution might not be as clear. Today we'll go over how to store encrypted key-value data with KMP without having to reinvent the wheel.
Multiplatform Settings is a solid multiplatform key-value store, created by Touchlab's own Russell Wolf, used extensively at Touchlab, as well as in Jetbrains' KMM Production Sample. There is a Settings interface that is implemented for Android, iOS, MacOS, and JVM platforms. At first glance, it doesn't look like Multiplatform Settings o…]]></summary>

For this article I’m going to assume you already understand the basics of Angular routing and components. I won’t bore you with building an entire application. We’ll get right to adding animations so you can see immediate results!
The finished code for this example can be found here.
In your app.module.ts add BrowserAnimationsModule to the module imports.

import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';
@NgModule({

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an old HP 4050N. For a variety of reasons, I want to have it behind a print server instead of having our laptops print directly to it. Here's how I set that up.
A Raspberry Pi (or honestly any Linux box) running docker. I like the Raspberry Pi and Odroid HC2 for this sort of thing because they have very low power consumption.
A printer that is supported by CUPS




  
  
  Setup


There are several docker images out there you can use, I made one (the source is on github at unixorn/docker-cupsd) because I wanted one that was multi-architecture - mine has AMD64, ARM7 and ARM64 all baked into the same image so you don't have to change the image label based on what system you're running it on. It works fine on Raspberry Pi, Odroids and Intel servers.
The unixorn/cupsd image is a bit on the large side because I crammed a lot of printer drivers into it, you may want to look for docker images that only support single printer families.
We're going to store printers.conf in a directory outside the container so that we don't lose our printer configuration every time we upgrade our container.
I run the cupsd server on an Odroid HC2 because I have /var/lib/docker on the 2TB drive attached to it. I could have put it on one of the Raspberry Pis in my cluster, but didn't want it spooling print jobs and causing excessive wear on a rPi's microSD card.
Make a directory to store your printer configuration. We'll use /docker/cupsd/etc

export CUPSD_DIR='/docker/cupsd/etc'
touch $CUPSD_DIR/printers.conf
Run the cupsd server with




sudo docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 631:631 \
  --privileged \
  -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
  -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
  -v "$CUPSD_DIR/printers.conf:/etc/cups/printers.conf" \
  unixorn/cupsd

You can now connect to http://SERVER:631 and add printers using the web UI.
When adding the printers to your Mac, select Internet Printing Protocol and put in the IP or DNS name of your print server machine.
The queues are printers/printername, not printername.]]></summary>

Enter Home Assistant.
The watcher script and associated tooling all presume that we can send messages to a MQTT topic that HA is watching.
Your computers should be configured to print to the cupsd server instead of directly to the printer.

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
