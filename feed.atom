Hey guys, have you ever wondered how to seed some mock data to your MongoDB database, whether for development/demo purposes or in actual production app? In this article, I will show you the easiest way to populate MongoDB database with very little code, and no, you wouldn't use fancy methods like the following ones.

// a bunch of codes go here...
import connectDb from "./utils/connectDb.js";

// MongoDB database connection
connectDb();

// To recognize incoming request as JSON object
app.use(express.json());

I bet a portion of your index.js or server.js file looks like this. The above is just a sample code snippet to make sure …]]></summary>

Currently, this script can perform a good variety of tasks such as ifconfig, ping, traceroute, port scans (including SYN, TCP, UDP, ACK, comprehensive scan, host discovery (scan for up devices on a local network), MAC address detection (get MAC address of a host IP on a local network), banner grabbing, DNS checks (with geolocation information), WHOIS, subdomain enumeration, vulnerability reconnaissance, packet sniffing, MAC spoofing, IP spoofing, SYN flooding, deauth attack and brute-force attack (beta).
Other features are still being implemented. Future implementations may include WAF detection, DNS enumeration, traffic analysis, XSS vulnerability scanner, ARP cache poisoning, DNS cache poisoning, MAC flooding, ping of death, network disassociation attack (not deauth attack), OSINT, exploits, some automated tasks and others.
If you want to become a contributor, make a pull request or issue.
Waiting for your feedback. Kudos

const responses = await Promise.all([
  fetch("/api/1"),
  fetch("/api/2")
])

Pretty straight forward.  However, if you were to do the above with 100 fetch calls instead, you might accidentally take down your server in a self-inflicted Denial of Service attack. Even if you protect against this in the API with rate-limiting, you're still going to see a lot of errors for failed requests as you scale up.
APIs are the exception.  Most types of external calls have no concept of rate-limiting at all - filesystem operations, system calls, etc.
For example, in NodeJS you can spawn new shells to call out to other programs on the computer. I use this in my open source A/B testing platform G…]]></summary>

I’m trying to level up my coding knowledge and learn more about various design and architectures decisions while trying to do cool things with the business logic side. 
Sample use case:
What I’ve come up with:
Create a new Key { id, Api Key, HOST URL } in the DB 
In the html request - Use Header X-Api-key and host URL is not public but known on the server.
Endpoint receives request
Looks up Api key & host in DB
If valid, next() in the function
If not, return 403 error “not Valid”
Next function implements business logics / transforms data.

Cookies are used typically to tell if two HTTP requests come from the same browser/user. So for session management, tracking and to a lesser extent personalization
For general data storage on the client, there are more modern APIs.
When client(browser) and the server communicate with HTTP calls (GET, POST etc) the calls include content, or a body and headers
The headers contain a lot of information on the request or response currently being transported. Things like content type, cache control and user agent. Headers are present both when client mades a request to the server, and when the server responds.

In this episode of the Dev Interrupted podcast, we asked some of our favorite engineering leaders if they could share memorable stories of professional mistakes with our audience.
The great thing about opening up about past mistakes is that it normalizes failure. All of us will make decisions that we come to regret - the best we can do is learn and grow from them. This is especially true of people in leadership positions who are responsible for managing teams.
In what will be the last podcast episode to feature excerpts from our INTERACT engineering leadership conference, Conor Bronsdon, Dev Interrupted Community Leader, presents a three-part interview he performed for audiences at INTERACT.
We applaud Luca Rossi, Head of Engineering at Translated; Shweta Saraf, Senior Director of Engineering at Equinix; and Chris Downard, VP of Engineering at GigSmart, for their candid, open responses about professional moments of failure.





  
  
  Episode Highlights Include:



The difference between agile and underdeveloped
How to be honest with yourself when you a mistake
Adapting to change as new information becomes available
Inspiring your team after you make an unpopular decision

STH can be treated both as a data processing engine and execution platform for multiple sequences running on the same platform and performing various data processing tasks. 
We named our apps "sequences" and that term describes well its nature, as they process data through a sequence of chained functions. Therefore usually, our sequences are concise and easy to write ,and powerful at the same time.
Our vanilla STH engine is based on Node.js and thus allows developers to benefit from the rich ecosystem and many packages and solutions provided b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Terraform🤔?


Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as a code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. It was developed by HashiCorp
Terraform CDK is a tool developed by terraform developers which allows you to write your infrastructure in your favorite language
It supports TypeScript, Python, C#, Go(Beta), and Java Currently.
Before we get started install cdktf-cli by running npm i -g cdktf-cli@latest and then run cdktf init to initialize a broiler code for you. Choose the language and name as your choice. For this instance, I will be using typescript.

Let's add AWS providers and try to make an EC2 Instance. There are some prebuilt providers like the following for typescript. So in this case we install the AWS provider by running npm i @cdktf/provider-aws

If in case you are using any other language then you can add your providers to the terraformProviders field in the cdktf.json file and run cdktf get to install the constructs and convert them to your native language
Here's my Typescript Code
Running cdktf synth will create a directory called cdktf.out where you will have your stack named folder which contains the terraform files.
Now you can run terraform init & terraform plan to initialize terraform and review your infrastructure resources and if you want to go ahead and apply the changes run terraform apply
You must have to terraform installed in order for cdktf to work. You can Download the latest version by visiting this link

If you guys want me write the same for other language do let me know in the comment section below]]></summary>

My goal is to give you a crash course into data warehouse performance, explain how to understand the performance of data APIs and highlight a few tools that help build responsive apps on top of data warehouses.
Broadly speaking, data warehouses are central locations for data from multiple sources. Call it a single source of truth.

Over the past five years, it has continued to grow in popularity until it is now by far the most liked "JavaScript flavour". According to the State of JS 2020 survey, TypeScript is now one of the most used frontend technologies and one with the highest positive opinions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past two years, I have written a few blog posts that explored how to figure out where the user physically is.  Most of these experiments involved navigator.geolocation but last week's iOS 15, Private Relay, and Geolocation post brought in the concept of figuring out the person's location based upon their IP address.  After finishing that post, I started to wonder what it would take to simplify things.  Can I reduce the number of API calls to things and make the result more reliable?  In the process, I decided that I would also wrap things up into a central Cloudflare worker.
So, let's see what the guts of the worker look like.
As you can see above, a lot of the returned data is just things that cloudflare knows about you, out of the gate but in order to get your likely street address, an API call to Mapquest is still needed.  I also set it up so that you can pass latitude and longitude values in as get variables.  If the user is on an LTE or 5g connection, their location is likely to show up as being in a completely different place.
So, how do we implement this new API?




Using the "Use GPS to update position" and "Use IP to update position" buttons, you can toggle between the two modes of detection.  Basically, one passes lat/long coordinates into the API and the other leaves it up to the node script to figure it out.
In a real-world setting, I would execute the IP-based detection by default and give the user the option to use the more accurate option if they wished to do so.  This is definitely getting integrated into my Wisconsin State Parks project.

Shiba Inu, the latest meme craze, has recently been the most talked about token in the crypto industry. Shiba Inu has risen 75% in the previous 24 hours while big tokens are suffering with 10% cuts.
Shiba Inu has reached a lifetime high of $0.00008 thanks to its remarkable rise. Its market cap is now hovering around $50 billion, making it the eighth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.
Sharat Chandra, a blockchain and emerging technology evangelist, said the current spike in the "Dogecoin killer" has been unreal, with it racing past altcoins like as Uniswap, Luna, Polkadot, and XRP.
Shiba Inu has surpassed Elon Musk's favourite meme token, Dogecoin, to become the most valuable meme token. Dogecoin fell more than 10%, dropping to 11th place on the cryptocurrency ladder.
Shiba Inu now has a larger market cap than Dogecoin for the first time. It is now worth more than Wipro, HCL Tech, Avenue Supermarts, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finserv, and L&T, among other Indian bluechip firms.
In the last seven days, the cryptocurrency has increased by more than 200 percent. It has risen by more than 1,200% in the previous three months alone.
An unknown crypto whale purchased 276.6 billion Shiba Inu tokens for around $11.5 million, according to statistics from WhaleStats, which follows the activity of the 1,000 largest Ether wallets, causing the rally to continue.
According to analysts, investors should understand that memecoins have no fundamental value and only increase due to the network effect of a large community and fan following. These are not assets that can be held and used to build wealth over time.
Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, recently snubbed Shiba Inu by revealing that he does not own any Shiba Inu tokens and instead holds Dogecoin in addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum.]]></summary>

What happens if your serialized string contains special characters ? yeah, it fails!
In order to solve that we can use
import encoding from 'encoding';

export function convertToUtf8Win1252(str) {
  return encoding.convert(str, 'WINDOWS-1252').toString();

Azure DevOps provides a set of REST APIs to interact with DevOps services programmatically. But there is no single API that allows us to create a PR with auto-complete enabled. So we have to make two API calls to achieve this. Create PR for the pull request creation and Update PR to set the pull request to autocomplete

This tremendously popular JavaScript runtime environment is praised by developers for its flexibility and effectiveness. And as a matter of fact, exactly the same can be claimed about microservice architecture. What are the benefits of both, and why in most cases is it a good idea to build an application based on microservices in Node.js, especially a SaaS one? Let’s find out.
A microservice is a software design pattern, where a group of interconnected services builds the entire application, in contrast to the monolithic approach to software development, where the application is built as one unit. These services are responsible for one function, they’re loosely coupled, isolated from the others, and ind…]]></summary>

Ever since the first Marvel movies came out it seems like in every movie there's the possibility of an extra scene hidden during or after the credits.
I grew tired of waiting through the entire credits just to find out there's nothing there, or even worse - leaving the theater to later realize I missed something.
To counter this I've decided to make a super simple app that simply tells you if you should wait the credits, with the press of a finger.
The app is open source, no ads or revenue whatsoever and made as a fan service.

I Used Figma for designing and prototyping, React with Typescript for the frontend implementation, Firebase as the backend and Capacitor.js for Android and iOS support. 
All in all, I managed to design, code and publish the app to Google Play in less then 3 weeks.

I've started the UX design process with few goals in mind:
Keeping it simple
One press away from results
Dark mode (to be used in theaters)
The app is divided into 3 main screens:
This screen is the first screen the user enters upon launching the app. It shows you the movies now in theaters (according to TMDB);
On this screen, the user can search for older movies, not currently playing.
This screen contains some general information about a movie, and mainly the card that tells the user whether or not they should wait for the end.
How user vote on the movie
The framework I eventually choose was React with Capacitor.js to build cross platform.
The app uses TMDB to get movie information and
The rest is pretty straight forward with React and Scss for styling.
If this interested you, or you have any questions or requests, I will be glad to answer.
*Edit: there's a known issue with the first time screen not showing the continue button to some devices. It's already fixed on the web but not yet updated in the Android App.

GitHub - stick-around

For example, you can specify a VID list or tags (with their indexes) to query vertices, or specify one or more VIDs to query a subgraph. When the queried vertices are retrieved, you can select one or more for further exploration. For example, you can query for the shared neighbors and the related paths of each pair of vertices. Through progressive queries, you can improve and enrich the data on the canvas for further graph analysis.

When the graph data is retrieved, you can manipulate it on the canvas flexibly, including drag-and-drop, zoom-in or zoom-out, click-and-drag, and marking vertices with colors or icons. Nebula Explorer enables you to have fun with the graph data model by providing various features.

Besides querying and exploring data, Nebula Explorer will support graph computing in the future, which will enable the Nebula Graph users to use appropriate methods to query and analyze graph data in various business scenarios.
Currently, Nebula Explorer is only available for Enterprise users. If you are interested, please send an email with “Require Dashboard” as the subject to inquiry@vesoft.com.

The security alarm system will use a bipolar junction transistor switch to detect security problems. Theft attempt and other security threats can be controlled by using this simple circuit.
For the purpose of this application, we will design a security system for one room in a house. The sensor used for each opening can be either a mechanical switch, a magnetically operated switch, or an optical sensor. Detection of an intrusion can be used to initiate an audible alarm signal. 
We will be using a mechanical switch as our sensor and use a transistor as a NOT gate, so that when there is an open switch in our room a transistor will show a signal that an intruder has entered.
Resistor
Transistor
Buzzer
Voltage source

Room sensor is normally in a closed position and it is connected to a DC voltage source. When a door is open it creates an open circuit.


Transistor switches are used for high power devices such as
The areas of operation for Transistor switch are known as the Saturation Region and the Cut-Off Region.
Cut-off Region: here there is a large depletion layer


Saturation Region: here the depletion layer is as




  
  
  NOT Gate Transistor


A NOT gate simply inverts its input. If the input is high, the output is low, and if the input is low, the output is high

The operation of this circuit is simple. The input is connected through resistor R2 to the transistor’s
When voltage is present at the input, the transistor turns on, allowing current to flow through the collector-emitter circuit directly to ground. This ground path creates a shortcut that bypasses the output, which causes the output to go low.
We run our simulation with a voltmeter connected to the output, in place of the buzzer .

In the normal state, the switch will be closed.

When intrusion happens, the switch will open and the alarm (buzzer) will go off.]]></summary>

Docker isn’t magic: it just packages features of the Linux kernel in a user-friendly way, and it's not the only software that exposes those capabilities. It's also important to understand that containers are not the same as "lightweight VMs".

Welcome to the third Type | Treat challenge! These challenges are a series of blog posts which have 2 code challenges in, one for beginners and one for intermediate TypeScript programmers. We're on day three, which means going over the answers from yesterday and have 2 new challenges.
There is many ways to decide how to type existing data, you could use literal types when you're sure of the exact formats - or be more liberal and use string when you expect a variety. We opted for literals, but using string is totally cool too.

That's why we talk about "security in layers" when it comes to building systems that handle sensitive data.

There's a debate to be had about whether using JavaScript or TypeScript leads to better outcomes when building a project. The advent of using JSDoc annotations to type a JavaScript codebase introduces a new dynamic to this discussion.
In this guide, we'll investigate what that looks like and come to an (opinionated) conclusion.
If you'd talked to me in 2018, I would have solidly recommended using TypeScript and steering away from JavaScript.
The rationale is simple: I'm exceedingly convinced of the value that static typing provides in terms of productivity and avoiding bugs in production. I appreciate this can be a contentious issue, but that is my settled opinion on the subject. Other opinions are available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why should you use Typescript?


Simple. It solves your problem. Let's see.
Type checking: This is why typescript really exists. It adds type checking over javascript. It stops you to write stupid code.

Let's see an example:
const addNums = (a, b) = {
return a + b
}

a and b should be numbers. But you stupidly pass strings.
addNums('1', '2')

output:
'12'

We don't want this to happen. It was a stupid example. But if you are working on a bigger project, this kind of bug can happen easily. You waste hours and hours to fix the code.

This is where typescript rescues us with type checking.
const addNums = (a: number, b: number) = {
return a + b
}

Now if you pass string it will give you an error so that you can fix it.

The goal of this service was to act as a middleware layer; that way, clients not written in Salesforce could retrieve and update contact data stored in Salesforce. This backend service implemented its own caching layer to provide a faster response time and also cut down on the number of times Salesforce needed to be called.
In “Leveraging Salesforce Using a Client Written In Svelte,” I introduced a simple client written in Svelte, which made it possible to update the Salesforce data using an inline editor—again, without actually using the Salesforce client.

Mount the CD:

What is the confirmation box in Angular? 


What is the best confirmation dialog for Angular, and why? 


How to integrate it into any Angular project?


How it looks like?







  
  
  What is the confirmation box in Angular?


It is a simple popup that prevents unwanted actions, for example when the user clicks the delete button, the popup dialog should appear with the question: "Are you sure you want to delete item data?" and two buttons "Confirm" and "Decline". That is an enhanced level of security needed in almost every professional application. 
It is the ngx-awesome-popup an open-source library made for Angular. It provides highly scalable options and styles to adapt to any angular project. The best part is it's callable only from typescript so it can be used directly in services without HTML templates and it uses observables. 

npm i @costlydeveloper/ngx-awesome-popup



imports: [

    NgxAwesomePopupModule.forRoot(), 

    ConfirmBoxConfigModule.forRoot()

]



confirmBox() {

        const confirmBox = new ConfirmBoxInitializer();

        confirmBox.setTitle('Are you sure?');

        confirmBox.setMessage('Confirm to delete user: John Doe!');

        confirmBox.setButtonLabels('YES', 'NO');



        // Choose layout color type

        confirmBox.setConfig({

            LayoutType: DialogLayoutDisplay.DANGER // SUCCESS | INFO | NONE | DANGER | WARNING

        });



        // Simply open the popup and listen which button is clicked

        confirmBox.openConfirmBox$().subscribe(resp => {

            // do some action after user click on a button

            console.log('Clicked button response: ', resp);

        });

    }

When we think of data there are 3 places we can think of encrypting data:
At Rest - On hardware storage devices like on a disk or in your devices 
In Transit - In moving data between different locations like server to server through API calls

Suppose you have a user database with extremely sensitive data, and also data that is less sensitive.
You wish to protect your most sensitive data, so you restrict access to it to some database users. Only privileged database credentials - available to a few micro-services and employees at the company - can grant read access to the data.
For example, in a typical SQL database like Postgres, this is possible through GRANT/REVOKE:

Authentication is a process of proving and recognizing user’s correct identity. Generally, it deals with an individual’s username, password, OTP verification, and some type of additional verifications.

Single-Factor Authentication (SFA)
Two-factor Authentication (2FA)
Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)
Token Authentication
Certificate-based Authentication
Biometric Authentication
Single-Factor Authentication is a widely used form of authentication. An user’s identity can be verified using username and password or pass code or other simple codes.
Like SFA, 2FA also uses username and password with an additional verification code that will be available on their owned device (mobile). This is an extra layer of protection to confirm their identity. For example, by enabling two …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If we use OnPush change detection strategy, immutability is helpful to ensure change detection works expectedly. 
One of the way to enforce immutability is using Immutable.js. However, using Immutable.js is not really straightforward. It adds another layer instead of using JS object directly e.g
const apps = List([{ name: 'slack' }, { name: 'skype' }]);
apps.get(0); // { name: 'slack' }

const app = Map({ name: 'slack' });
map.get("name"); // 'slack'

// Using Record if we want to access property directly
const AppRecord = Record({
    name: ''
});

class App extends AppRecord {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }
}

const newApp = new App({ name: 'slack' });
newApp.name; // 'slack'

We have to use get when using List and Map. Using Record could solve the issue, but if we have a very large object, using Record will be hard to maintain because we need to create each record per object and it's nested object.
Other issue is about JS compatibility because it needs to use fromJS and toJS methods to convert from and to JS object. 
I'd say that I'm not a fan of that lib and it makes things more complicated. 
Other possible approach I'm thinking of: 
readonly + ESLint immutable


Since Angular using Typescript, let's use Readonly<T>, ReadonlyArray to enforce immutability. 
Also add this no-mutation ESLint rule as extra protection https://github.com/jonaskello/eslint-plugin-functional/blob/master/docs/rules/immutable-data.md
is there any better approach?

I was doing a bit of bug-hunting in an old project of mine when I found an interesting bug. Can you find it?
If you know your security or PHP this might be quite easy for you. Otherwise, it might be a good exercise.
This is the request you would make to the server:
curl --location --request POST 'https://super.secure-api.com/check-pin' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
    --data-raw '{
      "pin": <you_answer>
    }'

And this is the code for that given endpoint (/check-pin)
if($params['pin'] != $user->getPin()) {
  throw new HttpException(403, "The pin is incorrect");
}

return "The pin is correct!";

PD: This is just a demo, not real code. You should never check passwords/pins/secrets like this.
pin to be able to bypass the check?


I will release a post in a couple of days explaining the bug in detail and how to fix it.]]></summary>

My first attempt was to use an interceptor service that contained a BehaviorSubject (Observable). I set it up to maintain a counter and set the observable's value to true if there were more than zero (0) requests in-flight.
Through heavy use of the console.log functionality, I came to realize that the interceptor was not always active, even though I was following proper singleton patterns.
The second attempt went more smoothly.
I had a second service (a handler) that maintained the counts and the BehaviorSubject. This one worked "like a charm."
