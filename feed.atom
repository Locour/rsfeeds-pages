        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Dog constructor from the last post worked well. However, notice that all Dogs that are created with the Dog constructor are automatically named Anakin, are brown in color, and have four legs. What if you want dogs with different values for name and color? It's possible to change the properties of each dog manually but that would be a lot of work:




let husky = new Dog();
husky.name = "Rex";
husky.color = "blue";

Suppose you were writing a program to keep track of hundreds or even thousands of different dogs in an aviary. It would take a lot of time to create all the dogs, then change the properties to different values for every one. To more easily create different Dog objects, you can design your Dog constructor to accept parameters:




function Dog(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 4;
}

let terrier = new Dog("Ewok", "tan");

Then pass in the values as arguments to define each unique dog into the Dog constructor: let terrier = new Dog("Ewok", "tan"); This gives a new instance of Dog with name and color properties set to Ewok and tan, respectively. The numLegs property is still set to 4. The terrier has these properties:




console.log(terrier.name); // will print out Ewok
console.log(terrier.color); // will print out tan
console.log(terrier.numLegs); // will print out 4

The constructor is more flexible. It's now possible to define the properties for each Dog at the time it is created, which is one way that JavaScript constructors are so useful. They group objects together based on shared characteristics and behavior and define a blueprint that automates their creation.]]></summary>

NOTE: this inside the constructor always refers to the object being created.
Notice that the new operator is used when calling a constructor. This tells JavaScript to create a new instance of Dog called hound. Without the new operator, this inside the constructor would not point to the newly created object, giving unexpected results. Now hound has all the properties defined inside the Dog constructor:




hound.name; // when console.log it will print out Anakin
hound.color; // when console.log it will print out brown
hound.numLegs; // whem console.log it will print out 4

Just like any other object, its properties can be accessed and modified:




hound.name = 'Obi-Wan Kenobi';

Here is an example of a constructor:

This constructor defines a Dog object with properties name, color, and numLegs set to Anakin, brown, and 4, respectively. Constructors follow a few conventions:
Constructors are defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from other functions that are not constructors.


Constructors use the keyword this to set properties of the object they will create. Inside the constructor, this refers to the new object it will create.

sayName: function() {return "The name of this dog is " + dog.name + ".";}

While this is a valid way to access the object's property, there is a pitfall here. If the variable name changes, any code referencing the original name would need to be updated as well. In a short object definition, it isn't a problem, but if an object has many references to its properties there is a greater chance for error.


A way to avoid these issues is with the this keyword:




let dog = {
  name: "Anakin",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayName: function() {return "The name of this dog is " + this.name + ".";}
};

dog.sayLegs();

this is a deep topic, and the above example is only one way to use it. In the current context, this refers to the object that the method is associated with: dog. If the object's name is changed to husky, it is not necessary to find all the references to dog in the code. It makes the code reusable and easier to read.]]></summary>

item,price
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

The goal is to create a one-line bash script that prints the sum of the prices in the file above, which is 7.77.
Step: 1. Print the file content
$ cat shopping.csv

This command prints the file content without modifications.
Output:
item,price
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

Step: 2. Cut the first line
There are many ways to achieve it, but we use the tail +n syntax.
In our case, it takes all the lines until the end of the file, starting from the second line.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2

Output:
rice,2.49
potatos,1.49
pasta,3.79

Step: 3. Cut the first column
awk splits each line by a separator defined by the option -F.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , '{print $2}'

Output:
2.49
1.49
3.79

Step: 4. Concatenate the prices
xargs is used to "squash" the lines into a single string, separating them by space.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , '{print $2}' | xargs

Output:
2.49 1.49 3.79

Step: 5. Replace spaces with pluses
The sed expression replaces the escaped space with + in the entire string (globally - g).
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , '{print $2}' | xargs | sed -e 's/\ /+/g'

Output:
2.49+1.49+3.79

Step: 6. Perform the calculation
bc is a simple calculator that you can use interactively or by piping an equation into it.
$ cat shopping.csv | tail +2 | awk -F , '{print $2}' | xargs | sed -e 's/\ /+/g' | bc

Output:

The most simple method to configure an application is installing dotenv and creating that lovely .env file on the root folder of your project.
This approach, however, has some pitfalls and is error prone. What if you don't set that process.env port? You'll probably have a default value (maybe 3000?), but you will need to run your application to discover such type of thing.
That same problem has been solved by typescript for almost anything. When you have the help of static typing, you can discover some errors a lot faster. That said, how can you use Typescript to have a type-safe way to access configurations?
Take a look at that short snippet:
export class EnvironmentService<Environment> {

  public constructor(
   private readonly variables: Environment
  ) {
    // some logic to assign process.env to this.variables
    // you can use, for instance, 
    this.variables = Joi.attempt<Environment>(process.env))
  }

  public get<T>(name: keyof Environment) {
    return <T><unknown>this.variables[name];
  }
}

In a nutshell,
First, you need to define an interface for you environment;
Then, you do pass it as a type parameter to the EnvironmentService class when instantiating a new object;
Finally, use something like class-validator, Joi or you library of choice to assert if the process.env object has all required variables and assign its value to the variables attribute;
After those simple steps, you can use the method get to fetch all possible environment variables with the help of typescript to guide your choice - and if you need, you can cast the value to some desired type:

That's all folks! If you liked that simple content, don't forget to comment and share with someone you might help. Also, that's my first attempt to write something in english: if you see something wrong, just message me on Twitter (@dotmendes

At some point you will probably need to store a user's auth token on the device, so they won't need to auth whenever they use your app. This is a solved problem on Android with EncryptedSharedPreferences and iOS with the Keychain Services API. But if you're creating a mobile app using Kotlin Multiplatform, the KMP solution might not be as clear. Today we'll go over how to store encrypted key-value data with KMP without having to reinvent the wheel.
Multiplatform Settings is a solid multiplatform key-value store, created by Touchlab's own Russell Wolf, used extensively at Touchlab, as well as in Jetbrains' KMM Production Sample. There is a Settings interface that is implemented for Android, iOS, MacOS, and JVM platforms. At first glance, it doesn't look like Multiplatform Settings o…]]></summary>

Simply put, WebSockets allow push messages, or "live data", to be sent from the server to the client (browser). Usually with HTTP, the client makes a request to the server, specifying that they would like some data please, the server responds with that data or an error and then the connection closes.
Since the client is the one opening the connections and initiating the requests, that leaves no room for the server to push data to the client when the server knows that an update is available.
That's where WebSockets kick in.

For this article I’m going to assume you already understand the basics of Angular routing and components. I won’t bore you with building an entire application. We’ll get right to adding animations so you can see immediate results!
The finished code for this example can be found here.
In your app.module.ts add BrowserAnimationsModule to the module imports.
...
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';
@NgModule({
    imports: [
        ...,
        BrowserAnimationsModule
    ],

})
export class AppModule {}

For unit testing, import NoopAnimationsModule instead. This fulfills the contracts while isolating unit tests from having to deal with the transitions.

✅ YES, we can! And I will show you how I did it.
I recently had to deal with a legacy code base of a .Net Full Framework project.
The source code was versioned on GitHub and there was a pull request and code review flow for integrating source code into the main branch. However, there were no checks to verify the code that was being integrated, which would allow source code that did not compile, or that broke unit tests, to be included in our main branch without any alerts.
The absence of quick feedback on the health of the integrated source code created some sense of insecurity in the developers during the approval of the pull requests, since problems inserted through the addition of new code could take much lon…]]></summary>

Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.
In a way, Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applic…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I was helping a new guy in angular with differences between the bind data in Angular, because it provides 2 ways to move data to DOM, One-way and two-way data binding it help us to build dynamic apps.
It binds the data from our component to the DOM, unidirectional from component to view or view to the component in few ways.
The interpolation is used with {{myproperty}} in the DOM.
<p>{{myproperty}}</p>

Add brackets around of property []like hidden angular bind the property for DOM elements or components.
<p [hidden]="myproperty"></p>
<app-username [name]="myproperty"></app-username>

Angular understand bind events using parentheses like (click) for DOM element or (userSelected) components event trigger.
<button (click)="close()">Close window</button>
<app-logout (logout)="hideDashboard()"><app-/logout>

Angular two-way data binding is bi-directionally communication, using the directive (ngModel) with combination of square brackets and parentheses of the event binding.
The ngModel is part of FormsModule from @angular/forms, it needs to be import in your app.module.ts
import { FormsModule } from "@angular/forms";
 @NgModule({ 
   imports: [BrowserModule, FormsModule], 
   declarations: [ AppComponent], 
   bootstrap: [AppComponent] 
}) 
export class AppModule { }

For a long time, I was just using the default software on Ubuntu but I was really frustrated, they were no way to annotate them to highlight a particular part. Moreover, I often felt the need to show things with an animated screenshot but just did not know how to do so.

Step 1 - Install lightobox

Open your terminal and run below command -
npm install --save ngx-lightbox

Step 2 - Update your angular.json
{ "styles": ["./node_modules/ngx-lightbox/lightbox.css", ...],}

Step 3 - Add Lightbox Module to your app.module.ts
import { LightboxModule } from 'ngx-lightbox'; @NgModule({ imports: [LightboxModule]})

You can do the next steps in your choice of components but I am assuming I need to make lightbox in app.component.html  
Step 4 - Add markup to html of your component

app.component.html
<div *ngFor="let image of _albums; let i=index"> <img [src]="image.thumb" (click)="open(i)" /></div>

Step 5 - Add lightbox code to your component's ts file,

app.component.ts
import { Lightbox } from 'ngx-lightbox'; 

export class AppComponent { 
private _album: Array = []; 

constructor(private _lightbox: Lightbox) {
 for (let i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
 const src = 'demo/img/image' + i + '.jpg'; const caption = 'Image ' + i + ' caption here'; 
 const thumb = 'demo/img/image' + i + '-thumb.jpg'; 
 const album = { src: src, caption: caption, thumb: thumb }; 
this._albums.push(album); 
} 
} 

open(index: number): void { // open lightbox 
this._lightbox.open(this._albums, index); 
} 

close(): void { // close lightbox programmatically 
this._lightbox.close();

Regardless of what kind of software it is, most apps use some sort of state. Whether it’s internal state or data fetched from an API, state management is a key element to building software. 
However, as an application grows, it becomes harder to track and manage those stateful variables. Updating the state in a predictable and effective manner becomes more difficult and can make it easier for bugs to sneak in. This is especially worse when there are no strict guidelines and code documentation.
A better alternative to managing state like this are state machines. State machines offer a predictable way to manage state by utilising a well-known mathematical concept called Automata Theory.
Let’s dive in a little deeper and break down what this means.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an old HP 4050N. For a variety of reasons, I want to have it behind a print server instead of having our laptops print directly to it. Here's how I set that up.
A Raspberry Pi (or honestly any Linux box) running docker. I like the Raspberry Pi and Odroid HC2 for this sort of thing because they have very low power consumption.
A printer that is supported by CUPS




  
  
  Setup


There are several docker images out there you can use, I made one (the source is on github at unixorn/docker-cupsd) because I wanted one that was multi-architecture - mine has AMD64, ARM7 and ARM64 all baked into the same image so you don't have to change the image label based on what system you're running it on. It works fine on Raspberry Pi, Odroids and Intel servers.
The unixorn/cupsd image is a bit on the large side because I crammed a lot of printer drivers into it, you may want to look for docker images that only support single printer families.
We're going to store printers.conf in a directory outside the container so that we don't lose our printer configuration every time we upgrade our container.
I run the cupsd server on an Odroid HC2 because I have /var/lib/docker on the 2TB drive attached to it. I could have put it on one of the Raspberry Pis in my cluster, but didn't want it spooling print jobs and causing excessive wear on a rPi's microSD card.
Make a directory to store your printer configuration. We'll use /docker/cupsd/etc

export CUPSD_DIR='/docker/cupsd/etc'
touch $CUPSD_DIR/printers.conf
Run the cupsd server with




sudo docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 631:631 \
  --privileged \
  -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus \
  -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
  -v "$CUPSD_DIR/printers.conf:/etc/cups/printers.conf" \
  unixorn/cupsd

You can now connect to http://SERVER:631 and add printers using the web UI.
When adding the printers to your Mac, select Internet Printing Protocol and put in the IP or DNS name of your print server machine.
The queues are printers/printername, not printername.]]></summary>

That's a hassle though, because inevitably we forget to shut it off sometimes and it stays on overnight or even for days, and while it has a powersave mode, the 4050N is so old that even that burns a good amount of power.
Enter Home Assistant.
The watcher script and associated tooling all presume that we can send messages to a MQTT topic that HA is watching.
Your computers should be configured to print to the cupsd server instead of directly to the printer.

The MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack is very popular for making full stack applications, utilizing Javascript for both the backend and frontend as well as a document-oriented or non relational database (MongoDB), meaning that it's structured like JSON rather than a large excel sheet like SQL databases are. 
This stack uses Express for the backend, and Express typically accompanies a view engine like Pug or EJS to render HTML dynamically. However, the MERN stack introduces a problem. React renders the frontend code with JSX, so you can't use those view engines, and you instead need a new way to render backend data for the client. You might suggest using JSX as your backend view engine, but then you would be losing a lot of the functionality that React brings to t…]]></summary>

So, if you are considering whether to connect to the public Wi-Fi network at the shopping mall, the airport, etc. beware of the potential risk to your device because hackers love public Wi-Fi!
The most effective trick to staying safe on public Wi-Fi is to use a VPN on your devices. Although virtual private networks are not infallible, they can protect your privacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These days whenever we post a URL (Uniform Resource Locator / Link) on any social media site, it will be converted to a short URL with that specific site's domain in it.
This is ok, because the shortened URL will reduce the number of characters in the post and also when you look at a post with a long URL (more than 25 characters in it), it will no look good.
But, we often receive messages over WhatsApp or other social media websites, sometimes even as SMS on our phone with short URLs in them, asking us to visit that URL to claim a gift or something else.
The main problem here will be that most of these short URLs will be created by using services which are free and you really cannot tell where you will be redirected by clicking on it.
There are a few websites and services which will tell you what is behind a short URL and where you will be redirected once you click on it.
One such service is ExpandURL - Link
First go to ExpandURL and there you will see a page like this,

Paste the short URL (which u received as a message) in the input text field and click on Expand URL
The service will check the short URL and will give you results of it. The results will be shown like this,

Results will include,
the number of redirects made from the short URL to the expanded URL (long URL)
Available Meta description, and keywords
Content-Type 
Whether the link appears to be safe or not (Google Safe Browsing)
This is only a way to check where the user will be redirected after clicking on the short URL and whether the URL is appearing to be safe or not.
After confirming that the URL is safe and clicking on it, you should also check the content on that website.
Sometimes, the URLs (long URL) of the phishing websites will also appear to be safe, ultimately it is us who should decide whether you can stay on that site or should leave immediately.]]></summary>

So the idea was to fetch the PDF data and return it to the client
The url is not directly used in the client as the E-commerce app requires api-key which is only defined in the server app
const axios = require('axios');
const url = "http://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf"
axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = "secret-key";

app.get('/download', async function(req, res) {
   try {
      // Fetch PDF from desired url
      const pdf = await axios.get(url);

      // Set response header to pdf 
      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/pdf');

      // Return PDF data to client
      return res.send(pdf.data);
    } catch (err) {

      // Throw if any error occurred
      return res.status(400).json(err);
    }
});

Testing this endpoint, a blank PDF document response was returned
Going through multiple forms and docs, trying different methods to achieve the same end result
Until I found the answer when I was just giving up where axios have a problem with requesting PDF
Where { responseType: 'arraybuffer' } is provided to axios options api
      await axios.get(url,{responseType:'arraybuffer'});]]></summary>

Think of a disposable, long password and write it down in Notepad or other text editor
Use it as your new root password
Create a primary user account and use the same password for the account password.
Finish and exit the the setup utilities
Now, you should be able to enter commands using the user "root". Use the following commands to change the password for "root" and your newly created user




passwd root

passwd your_newly_created_user
(Follow on screen instruction to type in your less secure password again)


There might be some debate on why you would want your password simple instead of using a complex one to improve security. 
In my case, I am setting up an environment on ZeroPi that try to match the Raspberry Pi OS in which it is easier for students to get started with Raspberry Pi's teaching materials (And one of them is the default user "pi" with password "raspberry").

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are familiar with Angular, you might already know how to use ng update, ng add or ng generate. Every time you execute those commands, a so-called schematic gets executed.
Schematics are a great way to save developers hours of work on reading migration guides or copying boilerplate code from one place to another. On top of that, they are a great way to ship best practices.
So, how do we write our schematics now? Unfortunately, it is not yet as easy as you might think. You can create a blank schematics project like this:
npm install -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli
schematics blank hello-world

The schematics-cli creates a pre-configured project for you with a ready-to-use ng generate schematic. Everything from that point on needs to be done manually and leaves a lot of open question…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently joined a team working on an Angular project (more about that later) but also had to deal with trying to find a place to live. Yes, at the moment, I am a nomad who decided I would travel to different cities before I settle down somewhere later in the summer. 
I recently had that feeling of having worked placed so much effort in learning something and finally have the opportunity to use this newly acquired skill. In my case, I was finally getting the hang of using NGRX for state management on an angular application until I realized that all of the state in the application I was working on was using Services and RXJS 🤯. 
And because I very well understood how to use NGRX, it was compelling to see how others had implemented state management without the need for an external library. Needless to say, this was one place I needed to take a step back in order to be reminded that there's always more than one way to tackle a hurdle or issue. 
As of now, I will have to delay my desire to have the ideal workstation, and learn how to develop in any space I environment as I travel to different places - and much of this will require a certain level of unlearning and establishing habits that help me become a better developer and person. I have taken to early morning runs/walks to break the monotony of my sun-light deprived room and bumped into this little gift:

A fuzzer now-days is a automated testing tool to find security bugs. It does so by generating many inputs to be executed until on of them crashes the target program. In other words the objective is to crash a program, but how can we guide the fuzzer in the right direction? 
AFL added to the objective a notion of code coverage: Any input that reaches an area in the code that was unreachable before is interesting. Even if it did not crash the program we can mutate that input to get even more coverage, we call this feedback. Over the past years coverage had proved to be a great feedback mechanism, but collecting it was not simple if one did not own the source code of the target binary.
AFL originally used compile time instrumentation to insert assembly instructions at the be…]]></summary>

Let's get started to exploit some features of fzf 😈
Probably your package manager already has it. If it doesn't, don't worry, just clone the git repo and run the install script as directed here.
You can check if the installation has been successful by running the command whereis fzf. You should see the location of binary.
Make sure to read the README.md from the project's Github. It explains fzf and some of it's usage quite well. Specially the key-binding pa…]]></summary>

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
