const awesomeData = {

JSON is nice for two reasons:

JSON doesn't take anything to set up, it's just there.

As developers we often perform POST and PATCH requests to API from our frontend apps. When we use TypeScript, this code should be typed safely. There are multiple ways to do so. Let's analyze one of them!
Let's imagine a player entity from a game:
// Create a type for our object
type PlayerType = {
  hp: number
  name: string
  position: [number, number]

// We can also use interface:
