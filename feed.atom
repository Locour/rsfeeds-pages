To start any communication a connection must be arranged.


Open a connection to start communications.


Close a connection to end communications. 


Meaning all communications between parties are arranged over a connection.


A connection is established before any data transmission begins.


Over TCP/IP, we'll always need to establish a connection between clients and servers in order to enable communications.

Deliveries over the connection are error-checked,

Flake8 is a linter. It's designed to find mistakes in your code that can later become bugs when your code is run.
A formatter arranges our code so that it's more readable on the screen, but does not change what our code does. Black and isort are formatters.
Let's install our linting and formatting tools. For a healthy coding environment use a virtual environment like venv or virtualenv (venv comes with Python).

A Raspberry Pi (or honestly any Linux box) running docker. I like the Raspberry Pi and Odroid HC2 for this sort of thing because they have very low power consumption.
A printer that is supported by CUPS




  
  
  Setup


There are several docker images out there you can use, I made one (the source is on github at unixorn/docker-cupsd) because I wanted one that was multi-architecture - mine has AMD64, ARM7 and ARM64 all baked into the same image so you don't have to change the image label based on what system you're running it on.

I've got an old HP laser printer in my basement. We barely print 10 pages a month between the two of us, so we only turn it on when we're going to print. That's a hassle though, because inevitably we forget to shut it off sometimes and it stays on overnight or even for days, and while it has a powersave mode, the 4050N is so old that even that burns a good amount of power.
Enter Home Assistant.
The watcher script and associated tooling all presume that we can send messages to a MQTT topic that HA is watching.
Your computers should be configured to print to the cupsd server instead of directly to the printer.

The MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack is very popular for making full stack applications, utilizing Javascript for both the backend and frontend as well as a document-oriented or non relational database (MongoDB), meaning that it's structured like JSON rather than a large excel sheet like SQL databases are. 
This stack uses Express for the backend, and Express typically accompanies a view engine like Pug or EJS to render HTML dynamically. However, the MERN stack introduces a problem. React renders the frontend code with JSX, so you can't use those view engines, and you instead need a new way to render backend data for the client. You might suggest using JSX as your backend view engine, but then you would be losing a lot of the functionality that React brings to t…]]></summary>

So, if you are considering whether to connect to the public Wi-Fi network at the shopping mall, the airport, etc. beware of the potential risk to your device because hackers love public Wi-Fi!
The most effective trick to staying safe on public Wi-Fi is to use a VPN on your devices. Although virtual private networks are not infallible, they can protect your privacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[These days whenever we post a URL (Uniform Resource Locator / Link) on any social media site, it will be converted to a short URL with that specific site's domain in it.
This is ok, because the shortened URL will reduce the number of characters in the post and also when you look at a post with a long URL (more than 25 characters in it), it will no look good.
But, we often receive messages over WhatsApp or other social media websites, sometimes even as SMS on our phone with short URLs in them, asking us to visit that URL to claim a gift or something else.
The main problem here will be that most of these short URLs will be created by using services which are free and you really cannot tell where you will be redirected by clicking on it.
There are a few websites and services which will tell you what is behind a short URL and where you will be redirected once you click on it.
One such service is ExpandURL - Link
First go to ExpandURL and there you will see a page like this,

Paste the short URL (which u received as a message) in the input text field and click on Expand URL
The service will check the short URL and will give you results of it. The results will be shown like this,

Results will include,
the number of redirects made from the short URL to the expanded URL (long URL)
Available Meta description, and keywords
Content-Type 
Whether the link appears to be safe or not (Google Safe Browsing)
This is only a way to check where the user will be redirected after clicking on the short URL and whether the URL is appearing to be safe or not.
After confirming that the URL is safe and clicking on it, you should also check the content on that website.
Sometimes, the URLs (long URL) of the phishing websites will also appear to be safe, ultimately it is us who should decide whether you can stay on that site or should leave immediately.]]></summary>

Let’s start exploring AWS API Gateway –
What is API?
An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software.
What is API Gateway?

API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.
What are stages in API Gateway? How it is useful for API Gateway deployment? 
In API Gateway has different stages – in which perform deployment of API’s and testing.
Each API is isolated to different stages.

So the idea was to fetch the PDF data and return it to the client
The url is not directly used in the client as the E-commerce app requires api-key which is only defined in the server app
const axios = require('axios');
const url = "http://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf"
axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = "secret-key";

app.get('/download', async function(req, res) {
   try {
      // Fetch PDF from desired url
      const pdf = await axios.get(url);

      // Set response header to pdf 
      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/pdf');

      // Return PDF data to client
      return res.send(pdf.data);
    } catch (err) {

      // Throw if any error occurred
      return res.status(400).json(err);
    }
});

Testing this endpoint, a blank PDF document response was returned
Going through multiple forms and docs, trying different methods to achieve the same end result
Until I found the answer when I was just giving up where axios have a problem with requesting PDF
Where { responseType: 'arraybuffer' } is provided to axios options api
      await axios.get(url,{responseType:'arraybuffer'});]]></summary>

It is also becoming increasingly common for open source projects to include devcontainer configuration in their projects, acclimatising developers to running new forms of potentially untrusted code on their local machines.

In this article, I want to share a solution to the problem of forwarding http traffic through socks5 to rotate ip-addresses, this can be useful when parsing, testing or bypassing DNS / IP-based blocking.
SOCKS  is an Internet protocol that exchanges network packets between a client and server through a proxy server. SOCKS5 optionally provides authentication so only authorized users may access a server. Practically, a SOCKS server proxies TCP connections to an arbitrary IP address, and provides a means for UDP packets to be forwarded.
SOCKS performs at Layer 5 of the OSI model (the session layer, an intermediate layer between the presentation layer and the transport layer). A SOCKS server accepts incoming client connection on TCP port 1080, as defined in RFC 1928.

Last week, I have developed ui-components.com.

I updated this website and added new 18 Ui components.
website: https://ui-components.com
https://github.com/YuikoIto/ui-components
The updates are as follows.
Added new 4 button components
Added new 2 input components
Created the Text Animation page and added new 4 text animation components
Created the Arrow page and added 4 arrow components
Created the Speech Bubble page and added 4 speech bubble components
Bug fixes
I added the following 4 buttons.

I added the following 2 inputs.

I added the following 4 text animations.

I'm using 5 span tags to separate this Hello characters, but I didn't want to use for example &:nth-child(1) and &:nth-child(2)... Then I used @for.
This is really useful.
  @for $i from 1 through 5 {
    &:nth-child(#{$i + 1}) {
      $delay: $i * 0.1 + s;
      animation-delay: $delay;
    }
  }

I added the following 4 arrows.

This is easy, but I think it's a bit bothersome. So I added.
I added the following 4 speech bubbles.

The bug fixes is below.
When a modal was open, clicking anywhere would close the modal.
Before

You may want to copy a part of the code while the modal is open, but before updating, no matter where you click in the modal, it closes.
After

Then, I fixed.

Think of a disposable, long password and write it down in Notepad or other text editor
Use it as your new root password
Create a primary user account and use the same password for the account password.
Finish and exit the the setup utilities
Now, you should be able to enter commands using the user "root". Use the following commands to change the password for "root" and your newly created user




passwd root
(Follow on screen instruction to type in your less secure password)

passwd your_newly_created_user
(Follow on screen instruction to type in your less secure password again)


There might be some debate on why you would want your password simple instead of using a complex one to improve security. 
In my case, I am setting up an environment on ZeroPi that try to match the Raspberry Pi OS in which it is easier for students to get started with Raspberry Pi's teaching materials (And one of them is the default user "pi" with password "raspberry"). But in general if you are using this system yourself, I would recommend a more complex and secure password for root instead.]]></summary>

Before we start, sorry if you don't understand English much, I'm from Argentina and I did this article with google translate.
I am one month away from starting a project in my company and it is a fairly large project that would receive hundreds of thousands of requests per minute.
We are deciding technologies, previously projects had been developed in Lumen and Java, this is not possible to migrate because it was not developed correctly and now the company wants to establish a stack of technologies in which all projects will be developed from here on.
In the last 2 weeks I have been researching and saw the following:
Laravel: Today it is not very common for PHP to be taught in schools and on the other hand it is a bit slow technology. Of course, the Octane package just came out and paints to exceed or at least reach the speed of the same web developed in Node. Meanwhile php is being less supported every day and despite the push it has been having with Laravel I think it will be left behind with the release of new Node frameworks.


AdonisJS: It is a Laravel in Node, but today it has almost no community, even though I read that its discord is very active.


NestJs: It is the most popular Node framework, I understand with which all kinds of rest apis can be developed. It also offers Fastify which is very convenient over Express due to support for asynchronous calls. I want to clarify that it is the one that investigates the least.




  
  
  The other part of the stack:


The idea would be to use ReactJS for Front and React Native for Mobile development.
I am also thinking of using InertiaJS or NextJS.
We are implementing Docker and Kubernetes.
My question is directed for you to comment without choosing sides, trying to be as impartial as possible.
What Technology Stack would you use?
Greetings and thank you very much for reading.]]></summary>

In this video, I'm using Bicep to deploy Azure Data Factory! Bicep is Domain Specific Language for deploying resources to Azure and is a HUGE improvement over ARM templates.




I've been trying to learn Bicep for my new job. Usually when it comes to Infrastructure code, I'd opt for Terraform since that's the first IaC tool I learnt. In my new role, I'm using ARM a lot more.
To be honest, I never really liked ARM. Messing about with JSON files wasn't my idea of fun, so when I first saw Bicep I was keen to give it a go.
I'm also planning to do more content with Azure Data Factory, so I'd thought it be good to make a video combining the two.
If you have any questions about the video, feel free to comment here or on YouTube.]]></summary>

Schematics are a great way to save developers hours of work on reading migration guides or copying boilerplate code from one place to another. On top of that, they are a great way to ship best practices.
So, how do we write our schematics now? Unfortunately, it is not yet as easy as you might think. You can create a blank schematics project like this:
npm install -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli

The schematics-cli creates a pre-configured project for you with a ready-to-use ng generate schematic. Everything from that point on needs to be done manually and leaves a lot of open question…]]></summary>

Yes, at the moment, I am a nomad who decided I would travel to different cities before I settle down somewhere later in the summer. 
I recently had that feeling of having worked placed so much effort in learning something and finally have the opportunity to use this newly acquired skill. In my case, I was finally getting the hang of using NGRX for state management on an angular application until I realized that all of the state in the application I was working on was using Services and RXJS 🤯. 
And because I very well understood how to use NGRX, it was compelling to see how others had implemented state management without the need for an external library. Needless to say, this was one place I needed to take a step back in order to be reminded that there's always more than one way to tackle a hurdle or issue. 
As of now, I will have to delay my desire to have the ideal workstation, and learn how to develop in any space I environment as I travel to different places - and much of this will require a certain level of unlearning and establishing habits that help me become a better developer and person. I have taken to early morning runs/walks to break the monotony of my sun-light deprived room and bumped into this little gift:

A fuzzer now-days is a automated testing tool to find security bugs. It does so by generating many inputs to be executed until on of them crashes the target program. In other words the objective is to crash a program, but how can we guide the fuzzer in the right direction? 
AFL added to the objective a notion of code coverage: Any input that reaches an area in the code that was unreachable before is interesting. Even if it did not crash the program we can mutate that input to get even more coverage, we call this feedback. Over the past years coverage had proved to be a great feedback mechanism, but collecting it was not simple if one did not own the source code of the target binary.

Object programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.
The Object class represents one of JavaScript's data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object() constructor or the object initializer / literal syntax.

In the classic sense, race conditions can cause bugs and unintended manipulation of your data. @vsavkin

Today I'm writing to tell you about the future of NodeSecure 👀.
I have not been very active in the last few months because of my job which has taken up a lot of my time. But I'm back 😊.
Moving forward and updating the project has become much more complicated 😵. So it was time to announce and make major changes.
NodeSecure is not only one tool anymore. The project is now a set of tools and packages that need to be maintained and extended. The project has also gained contributors on its way and many developers pushed me to go even further 🚀.
That's why I decided to gather these different projects in the same github organization (and same for npm with @nodesecure). It will also be easier to integrate new collaborators into the project.

JavaScript did not have exception handling until ECMAScript 3, which explains why the language so often automatically converts values and so often fails silently: it initially couldn’t throw exceptions.
On one hand, JavaScript has quirks and is missing quite a bit of functionality (blockscoped variables, modules, support for subclassing, etc.). On the other hand, it has several powerful features that allow you to work around these problems. In other languages, you learn language features. In JavaScript, you often learn patterns instead. Given its influences, it is no surprise that JavaScript enables a programming style that is a mixture of functional programming (higher-order functions; built-in map, reduce, etc.) and object-oriented programming (objects, inheritance).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Containerization of apps is a fast-growing practice as many companies are embracing the cloud and DevOps concepts. Docker packages an application, libraries, and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any server. Being that most applications do not run on one single component (even dinosaur apps 🦖 have frontend and backend components), we need a way to define and manage multi-container apps.
In this tutorial I will utilize Docker compose to get a blog up and running that consists of a Ghost Blog service and a MYSQL service; both services will use volumes for persistent storage. This tutorial assumes you have working knowledge of Docker and a server with Docker and Docker compose installed.

Compose is a file format for describing distributed Docker apps, and it’s a tool for managing them.
Ghost is a free and open source blogging platform written in Javascript.
1. SSH into the server and become root
ssh <username>@PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS
sudo su -
Step 2 — Create a Ghost Blog and MySQL service
2. Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root directory
vi docker-compose.yml
Add the following contents
version: '3'
services:
  ghost:
    image: ghost:1-alpine
    container_name: ghost-blog
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:2368
    environment:
      database__client: mysql
      database__connection__host: mysql
      database__connection__user: root
      database__connection__password: P4sSw0rd0!
      database__connection__database: ghost
    volumes:
      - ghost-volume:/var/lib/ghost
    depends_on:
      - mysql

  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    container_name: ghost-db
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: P4sSw0rd0!
    volumes:
      - mysql-volume:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  ghost-volume:
  mysql-volume:

3. docker-compose up -d
Congrats your blog is up and running! Validate via the public IP address of your Docker server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First up some basics
WSL2 with ubuntu 20.04
A lot of the logic in the scripts I write rely on bash's if.. then.. else. The basic syntax of the statement is as follows:
 
    if [ {statement} {operator} {value} ]
[...] tells bash to evaluate the command and return 0 or 1 for the conditional expression inside the square brackets.
tldr; ensure things evaluate correctly.
> is used to redirect the output of a command somewhere.
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$ cp file1 file2
   cp: cannot stat 'file1': No such file or directory
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$ cp file1 file2 >&- 2>&-
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$

$? returns the success of the previous command, 0 for success and >= 1 for failure. Lets look at the previous example and see what the output is.
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$ cp file1 file2 >&- 2>&-
   dev@Dark-Matter:~$ echo $?
   1

   #!/bin/bash
   cp file1 file2 >&- 2>&-
   if ["$?" = "1" ]
   then
      touch file1
      cp file1 file2
   else
     echo "File copied to file 2" 
   fi


#!/bin/bash
# Check we have a parameter

if [ "$1" = "" ]
then
   echo "syntax: old {filename}"
fi

# Copy the file as .old
newFileName="$1.old"
echo $newFileName
cp $1 $newFileName >&- 2>&-

if [ "$?" = "0" ]
then
      echo "File has aged and has had '.old' appended to it"
      exit 0
else
     echo "File has not been born yet or you do not have parental rights to the file."
     exit 1

.NET Core is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications. Software developers often need to use the Dotnet core framework on the Linux system to test, run, and build the packages.
The notion of using Dotnet on Linux comes true through the new Dotnet core, which is an API based modular system of Microsoft’s Dotnet framework. But the Dotnet core doesn’t act as a single API; it functions as a shared or public library of API and codes.
Prerequisites
An Ubuntu installed system.

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
