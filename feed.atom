A SSG is a command line tool that helps users to convert .txt files or .md files into .html files. 
This project is quite fun and offers me a bunch of new knowledge.
First off, I created an issue mentioning about what I wanted to improve in on her code. I listed all the necessary tasks to be done and sent the issue. After she accepted and assigned me to the issue, I started to write code right away and created a pull request for the code I wrote. It's actually not a big deal for me at all because her code was pretty clean and understandable. Although she requested a few changes in my code, everything went well and my pull request got merged right after that.
Same thing happens in my code I guess because we had no trouble understanding each other's code. The process was quite straight forward, she filed an issue -> I accepted it -> she coded it -> I requested some changes as she added some extra lines that were not necessary. However, there was one thing I had to do which is pulling her code into my machine so that I could test it out. While testing her code, I just realized that I had a quite big bug in my code that I didn't know about. However, her issue was just for the new feature about config file, so I decided to create another issue about the bug I mentioned above and resolved it after her code got merged.

The data is remote, you need to fetch it somehow, you also probably need to think about how to convert the incoming data and lastly create that web report. If you are a developer, you probably think that oh ok, this is probably a few moving parts, 10-20 lines of code. But you've heard of PowerShell, it's supposed to be powerful, do a lot of heavy lifting, so why not give it a spin.

With Commotion, you can create forms that you can embed in Notion pages and that save results into a Notion database, so you never need to leave the platform. Here's how you get started.
This one is fairly straightforward. Go into your Notion workspace and create a Notion database like below.

Head over to Commotion.page and sign up for an account. It's a freemium service, so sign up and check it out for free for as long as you like and upgrade to Pro only when you want!
You'll need to connect your Notion account in order to create forms with Commotion. Don't worry, Notion has a super easy flow, so just press the connect button, select which pages you want to create forms for, and hit allow access.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As mentioned in our previous article, Medusa is participating in Hacktoberfest for the first time this year and the excitement is high. 
There are loads of issues out there for developers to pick up, but it's not always easy to figure out where to start. We've made a series of good first issues that includes both a video tutorial and a checklist, such that you can easily get started building in public.
The issues chosen for the series deal with API fixture generation. Currently, our fixtures are all stored within the same file, which is suboptimal due to 1) loading large files on the client (our API reference) is bad for performance and user experience and 2) referencing a single fixture in such a large file requires us to look for a needle in a haystack. 
The goal is to split each fixture into their own dedicated file making them lightweight and easy to reference.
The issues can be found filtering on label api-fixture, or use this link for easy access.
To easily get started use the following checklist:
checkout docs/api

branch out to docs/api-[ns]-[endpoint]

if necessary clear dist and run yarn bootstrap

cd integration-tests/docs

yarn && yarn build
medusa-dev --scan-once
Open __tests__/[ns].js

Import from ../test-input/[ns]/[endpoint]

Add test to the toTest array
yarn test --watch __tests__/[ns].js -t [operationId]
Make changes
Make sure that snapshots are correctly defined so that tests pass across two runs
Only add the fixtures and test changes related to your generated fixtures
Push and open PR against docs/api



Additionally, you can watch this video tutorial

When to use declarative code
Conclusion
Functional Programming is a declarative programming paradigm, in contrast to imperative programming paradigms.
Declarative programming is a paradigm describing WHAT the program does, without explicitly specifying its control flow.
Imperative programming is a paradigm describing HOW the program should do something by explicitly specifying each instruction (or statement) step by step, which mutate the program's state.
This "what vs how" is often used to compare both of these approaches because... Well, it is actually a good way to describe them.
Granted, at the end of the day, everything compiles to instructions for the CPU. So in a way, declarative programming is a layer of abstra…]]></summary>

Still, seeing the number getting more and more precise continues to amaze me. In order to refresh some old memories, I decided to implement an interactive simulation in React and TypeScript.
Let me explain the idea behind the Monte Carlo Simulation with an analogy to rain. Take a sheet of paper and draw a unit square (whose sides have length 1) on it. Inside this unit square, draw a quarter circle with a radius of 1. It will look like this:

Since I sold my startup, I have been left with a void that my creative mind was looking for ways to fill.
One of the ideas that I kept coming back to prior to selling my startup was a notification gateway as a service. I went ahead and scratched my itch and MessageRaft is the result of that.
Let's get some things out of the way first.
A notifications gateway as the name implies is a portal where notifications pass through. In layman terms, it's basically a server that has an API exposed to other services/apps and receives requests.
And you guess it, notification requests. Simply put, it is a single API that can process multiple types of notifications and dispatch accordingly.
While it is still in its infancy, it is fully functional, the core is open-source hence it is free to use and you can get started in under 2 minutes (your internet connection and computer is the only bottleneck on that!!!)
So, without further ado, I have built and released a CLI which you can use to get started here
Messageraft is going to be 100% build in public and its core will always be free. I am looking to see if it picks traction and if it does I plan to create a product around it for people who don't want to host the service themselves plus a magnitude more providers support.
In addition, I have recently released a helper tool that makes it even easier and faster to develop and test emails locally from your machine with the help of MessageRaft which I am going to cover in another article so stay tuned for that!
This is the first time I am building in public and would appreciate any type of feedback you can provide. As always you can find me on twitter]]></summary>

In software engineering, a pull request is the process in which a contributor asks a repository owner to merge their changes into the main codebase. 
The PR is important, as it acts as a crucial safety buffer when developing software. It gives a chance for both manual validation (e.g. code reviews) and automatic checks (e.g. unit tests) to take place, as well as discussions between the repository's maintainers.
Once the code has been approved, it can be assumed safe to merge in, and will eventually become part of the next release. 
This safeguard should result in the main branch of code remaining in a production-ready state, all of the time.

One of the great benefits of Doppler is keeping your project in sync. We want to be able to sync our app wherever we develop and deploy. It only takes a few minutes to integrate the Vercel marketplace with Doppler, and that is what we will be doing in this tutorial
In this tutorial we will learn how to install the Doppler integration from Vercel’s new marketplace. Learn how to sync the secrets in your doppler project for deployment.
The first thing we want to do is to login to our doppler account. I won’t be touching the details of creating an account and login into doppler, because I have already done an introduction to doppler in a previous post. So once we have logged into Doppler, we head over to Vercel and add our project we want to integerate doppler with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diffusion™ 6.3 introduced topic views, a mechanism to produce virtual topics (known as reference topics) that refer to other topics in the topic tree for their value. In 6.4, we added topic view expansion, enabling a single source topic to be expanded to produce many derived reference topics. In Diffusion 6.5, the concepts of fan-out and topic views were combined to allow remote topic views to specify source topics at another server.

Summary
Topic view inserts introduce powerful new functionality into the ever-developing language of topic views.

And each consumer requires the use of such a product. As a result, selecting the most appropriate and dependable technologies for your projects is critical. Both Angular and PHP have applied sciences, and thus this can create confusion as to what can be the best option for developers to choose from in 2021.
So, before we move to compare them, let us first understand what PHP and Angular are.
Angular is an open-source framework that is TypeScript based and used to build applications for desktops and websites.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Lately, I'm learning React and its frameworks (like Next.js) and libraries. I even remake my personal site as my first portfolio in React. Just made it using Next.js and Chakra UI and integrated it to my Notion workspace.
To connect my web to my Notion workspace I used React Notion from Splitbee. You can check it for a while.
So, React Notion use Notion API Worker to handle its requests. It can be also self-hosted using Cloudflare. Cloudflare offers a generous free plan with up to 100,000 request per day.
I will not explain about React Notion details, you can check it alone by yourself. I'll write about how to self-host the Notion API Worker using Cloudflare.
You can login to Cloudlfare worker site or register if you don't have an account yet.
Before go further, you can fork and clone the Notion API Worker.
After you cloned it, install the dependencies using yarn.
Rename the file named wrangler.example.toml to wrangler.toml.
Edit wrangler.toml according to your preferences. Here's also example of mine.




name = [Your worker url]
webpack_config = "webpack.config.js"
type = "webpack"
workers_dev = true
compatibility_date = "2021-10-07"

account_id = [Your Cloudflare account ID]
zone_id = [Your Cloudflare zone_id]

route = "[Your domain]/*"


Make sure you have installed wrangler. You can see how to install it here.
You can edit the scripts in package.json if you want so you can run it with your custom command.




  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack",
    "dev": "wrangler dev",
    "preview": "wrangler preview",
    "deploy": "wrangler publish"
  },

To run it locally, you can run yarn dev and open the link.


To see the preview you can run yarn preview.
The last thing, you can deploy it to Cloudflare server using yarn deploy or wrangler publish. Then open the link in your browser.




Tadaaaaa, it's done. You can check your API worker in your Cloudflare dashboard. This is my first english article, LOL. I hope it can help and inspire you.]]></summary>

Let’s start with a small example:
function sortNumbers(array: Array<number>) {
  return array.sort((a, b) => a - b)
}

Now look at the code below and look if everything looks good. Think about what the console output will be. I recommend taking some time and actually thinking about it!
const numbers = [7, 3, 5];

const sortedNumbers = sortNumbers(numbers);

console.log(sortedNumbers);
console.log(numbers)

The first output is pretty simple. It is [3, 5, 7].  But now listen. The second output is the same! And you might be asking: Why? I defined the array as const how can it be changed?.
Well, arrays and objects are quite special in JavaScript. If you pass them to a function it will pass the reference to the array or object which means it will mutate the original arr…]]></summary>

TypeScript just turned 9 years old, and it’s more popular than it’s ever been. As a matter of fact – it’s close to becoming the de facto standard for most JavaScript projects being started today. But is it still the best choice in 2021?
In this article, we’ll look at some of TypeScript’s main benefits, and what alternatives are out there.
In order to look at how relevant TypeScript really is, we need to look at the main benefits we get from using it in our codebases. Here are some of the main upsides from going from .js to .ts:
Applying a type system to your codebase makes you much more confident your code will work. You can specify what kind of arguments are required, and enforce those constraints with near-instant compiler feedback. This makes it much easier …]]></summary>

Every wonder why your meta tags seem to work sometimes, but not other times? It is because ngOnInit is NOT an async function, even with async, neither is a constructor which must return this, and neither is an async pipe in your template. Sometimes the fetches return on time, other times they don't. So, I added this post:
ngOnInit does NOT wait for the promise to complete. You can make it an async function if you feel like using await like so:
import { take } from 'rxjs/operators';

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all agreed about not manipulating data inside component or better to say presentation layer.
So I decided to put logout logic inside guard, this way I will be able to just call logout route and done!
For this I've configured my authentication module routes like this:
{
    path: 'login',
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false }
  },
  {
    path: 'register',
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: true }
  },
  {
    path: 'logout',
    component: AuthComponent,
    data: { registering: false },
    canActivate: [LogoutGuard]
  }

I love to keep things as simple and low as possible 😁
For log out I've added canActivate field and passed the LogoutGuard, the guards have the ability to return UrlTree. It is awesome, let's see how the guard implemented:
@Injectable()
export class LogoutGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private store: Store, private router: Router) {
  }

  canActivate(): UrlTree {
    this.store.dispatch(logout());
    return this.router.createUrlTree(['auth', 'login']);
  }
}

That's it!
The canActivate method is dispatching logout action from NgRx solution and then returning the URL tree which is created using Router from angular/router library!
After this, all we need, any where in the APP we can just redirect user to auth/logout and expect it work as expected and user will automatically will be redirected to auth/login route.
Thank you for reading 🙏🏽
Hope you liked ☕]]></summary>

Preloading is great. It lets us fetch parts of our application before it is even requested for. By doing this, our content is ready to be served when needed without any delay. There are many ways of doing this, I'll be touching upon some of the ways to do this in Angular and how we can create our own custom preloading strategy based on the user's network state.
Angular provides us with route-based preloading out of the box. There are two strategies namely PreloadAllModules and NoPreloading.
NoPreloading, as the name suggests does not preload any modules. This is the default behaviour.
PreloadAllModules, on the other hand, preloads all modules. A simple example adding a preloading strategy in a routing module file can be seen below

Also, the tutorial will explain how to transfer files from client to server, server to client and server to server using SCP.
FTP is an old and insecure protocol that can be used to transfer files between local networks or computers connected through the Internet. However, FTP is not recommended to use to transfer files over the Internet anymore as it transfers usernames and passwords in cleartext. In addition to that, FTP provides an anonymous method that let you transfer files even without a username and password.

  Telegraph.nvim


Check out the project readme
I want a simple way to make remaps into shell commands that can open new tmux
For example I want to make remaps to do things like open the current file in lookatme.
# vim :terminal
nnoremap <leader>s <cmd>Telegraph pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark<cmd>

# tmux session
nnoremap <leader><leader>s <cmd>lua require'telegraph'.telegraph({cmd='pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark', how='tmux'})<CR>

# tmux popup
nnoremap <leader><leader>S <cmd>lua require'telegraph'.telegraph({cmd='pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark', how='tmux_popup'})<CR>

The main goal here is that remaps become one liners that can just be put
init.vim without creating a whole new lua module for each
telegraph takes in a how argument to determine where to tun the command.j
term(default) runs command in the built in terminal
tmux runs command in a new tmux session and joins it.
tmux_popup runs command in a tmux popup window.
tmux_popup_session runs command in a tmux session and displays it in a popup
subprocess runs command in a subprocess
The current set of format strings that can be used with telegraph.  Placing
{} within your command will get rendered into something with
cword - the current word under the cursor
cWORD - the current BIG Word under the cursor
cline - the current line under the cursor
filepath - the filepath of the current file
filename - the filename of the current file
parent - the parent directory of the current file
current_session_name - name of the current tmux session
cwd - the current working directory
Check out the repo and give
it a star if its something that interests you.]]></summary>

Dynamic rendering, on the other hand, is often considered to be a workaround for social media crawlers or search engines that are not running on JavaScript.

Vim is the dark side of the programming, you can rule everyone with vim. 
Vim has several modes with different functions but these are the  most commonly used.
Normal mode is Vim's default mode. When you are in normal mode you can navigate, perform operations, and destroy your keyboard.
h -> move to left
j -> move to down
k -> move to up
l -> move to right
0 -> move to the beginning of the line
$ -> move to the end of the line
w -> move to the next word
b -> move to the back word
e -> move to the end of current word
gg -> move to the beginning of current buffer
G -> move to the end of current word
:q -> exit from the editor
:w -> save the editor
In this mode you can enter text, delete and edit the document.
i -> enter insert mode to the left of the cursor.
a -> enter insert mode to the right of the cursor.
I -> enter insert mode to the beginning of the line.
A -> enter insert mode to the end of the line.
o -> enter insert mode one line down.
O -> enter insert mode one line up.
In this mode you can select parts of the document, copy them, cut them, delete them and paste them.
y -> yunk the selected characters.
d -> cut or deleted the selected characters.
p -> paste.
