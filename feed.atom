how to add the port 8080/tcp in my system and list all the active ports in a text file called "zones.txt". I use a Linux Mint 20.1 XFCE system and I came across the apt-package named Uncomplicated Firewall. This package allows you to open ports on your system and makes them ready for use using ssh.
