Sometimes I join online events.
So this time I will try converting.
Node.js ver.16.4.2
TypeScript ver.4.3.5
moment ver.2.29.1
moment-timezone ver.0.5.33
ts-loader ver.9.2.3
webpack ver.5.42.0
webpack-cli ver.4.7.2
For getting my own timezone, I just create a Date instance.
const currentDate = new Date();
console.log(currentDate);

Sun Jul 11 2021 08:39:08 GMT+0900 (Japan Standard Time)

The timezone came from OS settings.
I can create Data instances by formatted string.
const currentDate = new Date('Jul 10 2021 19:48 EDT');
console.log(currentDate);

Sun Jul 11 2021 08:48:00 GMT+0900 (Japan Standard Time)

Indeed there are many different types of APIs, and the word API stands for application programming interface, while REST means representational state transfer, and this type of API will be the main focus of this article.

Let's install Ubuntu terminal on your windows 10 computer.
START button, and type :
Turn Windows Features On/Off
Drag the windows list down and make sure that 
windows subsystem for Linux is checked.
Click Ok, then restart your computer.


 
When you will come back, open your command prompt and type bash, you'll find a message tellin' you that no linux distributions are currently installed, or somehtin' like that :) 
Go to Microsoft Store, and search for Linux, you will find a lot of distros from which you can choose : Kali, Ubuntu, etc...

Install your desired distro, and you will be ready to rock and roll; let's say you installed Ubuntu, you will find Ubuntu's terminal app in the start menu; click on that and wait :
Installing, this may take a few minutes...
Once finished, you can start working on your Ubuntu Bash Terminal.
What is Linux ? An operating system ? No!

Basic Bash Terminal Commands:
pwd — When you first open the terminal, you are in the home directory of your user. 
The root is the base of the Linux file system. It is denoted by a forward slash( / ). 



ls — Use the "ls" command to list the files that are in the current directory. 




You can list contents of a a specific folder, let's say documents : 
~$ ls \documents
cd — Use the "cd" command to go to a directory. For example, if you are in the home folder, and you want to go to the downloads folder, then you can type in:
~$cd Downloads
~$cd ..
For more Linux commands, watch my Bash commands for beginners.

I am quite a beginner in programming and and am just interested in learning new stuff about programming and the most efficient ways to program. My friend is a linux hippie, often peer pressuring me to do stuff the "Linux way". Recently he told me to try out this tiny editor named Emacs.
Hey, what could go wrong right?
I install the editor. First thoughts: "ew, this looks like notepad but worse"
I'm getting a hang of the keybindings, although I would much prefer writing code the evil way (evil as in vim).
So for context, I use vim, I quite hated the shortcuts on emacs, so I was ready to leave this editor and go back to vim when my friend suggested I try out doom emacs. "sure, sounds cool" I said
DOOM EMACS IS AMAZING, I love org mode (I know its not exclusive to doom, but still) I love the fact that pressing space and some other keys has some cool secret keybinding (believe me it makes sense while using it), I love the fact that I can use vim keybindings directly in emacs, Doom theme is awesome, the Doom logo made in text in the homescreen is really cool to look at, configuring the editor is made really easy with the packages.el and init.el and config.el.
I need help, I have converted all my dotfiles into org files, I have replaced all my applications with emacs, I use emacs as my email client, I use emacs as my browser, I use emacs as my discord client, I use emacs as my file manager, Please send help, I am addicted to emacs
Help its possesing me
Welcome to the church of Emacs
Boring stuff about me: I am Ansh, a 15 year old student who loves to program and break my computer trying to distrohop, I'd love to meet anyone else with the same interestes, If interested please be sure to say Hi, I love making friends , Thank you]]></summary>

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment)
Mozilla 
Let's take an example:
function adder(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a + b;
  };
}

let add5 = adder(5);
let add10 = adder(10);

console.log(add5(2));  // 7
console.log(add10(2)); // 12

From above code, it's clear how closures work, and how it remembers the lexical scope, the function was declared within. But how this could be useful, or is it just non-practical questions in JavaScript interviews?

Se sim provavelmente você pensou que era necessário fazer toda uma configuração.
Não importa se você usa Sublime, VSCode, WebStorm ou outro editor/IDE, será necessário no mínimo configurar um arquivo.
Bom eu utilizo VIM, não largo por nada rs
Mas voltando pro foco, que tal utilizar o próprio Chrome DevTools como Debug?
É muito fácil.
Se você já tem o Node instalado pode utilizar a flag —inspect-brk para iniciar um Websocket com o Google Chrome. Essa flag adicona um break antes do código ser executado.
Vamos começar com um único

Show, agora vamos entrar no Google Chrome e digitar no campo de url chrome://inspect, o Chrome irá abrir um página com nosso script, clicando em inspect ele irá abrir o DevTools.

Agora com nosso DevTools aberto podemos adicionar break points para conseguir encontrar o erro.

Caso você esteja trabalhando em um projeto grande pode adicionar um script no seu package.json, “dev:debug”: “node —inspect-brk app.js”
Nesse cenário teremos que adicionar a pasta do no projeto na sessão Filesystem em Add folder to workspace, para podermos navegar entre os arquivos e adicionar nossos break pointers.
Espero que esse pequeno artigo ajude vocês no dia a dia com Node.

$ npx -p @angular/cli ng new esbuild-ng-cli

probably due to some recent package updates, I needed to tweak dependencies before the installation passed.
We need few more steps to build with esbuild. First, installing esbuild as dependency:
$ npm install esbuild --save-dev

There are many articles about it online but no one takes care of all aspects - until now. With this guide you'd be able to go from zero 0️⃣ to hero 🗻 when talking about containers and .NET 5.0 WebApi.
This articles focuses on building the app inside a Linux container. 
The following topics are going to be considered in this guide:
Configuration
Testing
OpenAPI spec (Swaggerfile) generation
Image size optimizations
Container security
Overwriting defaults
This is the base version we are going to improve step by step in this guide. The major downside is, that there is much more included in the final image than we need for production use.

Cannot generate CSV from deep objects.
I'm pretty sure CSV parsing can be implemented in less than 1Kb min.js.gz. So I did it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kali ini, kita akan membahas bagaimana kita membuat aplikasi Node.Js menjadi Production atau Development. Terdapat banyak cara untuk melakukannya, tergantung dengan apa kita akan melakukanya. Kali ini kita akan mencoba melakukan set node_env ke production atau development dengan menggunakan beberapa cara.
Cara melakukannya cukup mudah, yaitu hanya cukup menggunakan command prompt atau power shall, sebelum memulai aplikasi Node.js kita. Berikut beberapa cara untuk melakukan set node_env pada aplikasi Node.Js kita.
Untuk yang menggunakan OS Linux atau unix based system lainnya, dapat menggunakan perintah berikut ini:
export NODE_ENV=production

Apabila kita menggunakan OS Windows kita bisa menggunakan perintah berikut ini:
SET NODE_ENV=production

Apabila kita menggunakan PowerShell kita dapat menggunakan perintah berikut ini:
$env:NODE_ENV="production"

Kita juga bisa melakukan set di setiap running aplikasi kita dengan menggunakan perintah berikut ini, tapi perintah ini hanya akan berlaku untuk aplikasi tertentu yang sedang kita running tidak secara global. Cara ini dapat digunakan untuk melakukan testing pada aplikasi kita:
NODE_ENV=production node app.js

Kebanyakan akan menemui error saat menggunakan perintah di di atas, seperti berikut:
'NODE_ENV' is not recognized as an internal or external command

Untuk melakukan set node_env dengan perintah di atas, perlu untuk install dependensi berikut win-node-env, dengan cara menuliskan perintah berikut ini:
npm install -g win-node-env

Cara lain, kita dapat menggunakan package tersendiri untuk melakukan set node_env, yaitu dengan menggunakan package cross-env.
Saat mengubah NODE_ENV ke dalam mode production, semua devDependencies pada file package.json akan diabaikan semuanya saat melakukan running aplikasi. kita juga dapat menggunakan perintah berikut ini:
npm install --production

PyCharm is a great and powerful tool, but it comes at a price. Yesterday I tried to run PyCharm on my old laptop (Core i3 / 4 GB of RAM), it is completely unusable, just lagging. After that, I decided to change my basic tools to some basic ones, such as bash, git, vim, etc. Because at least I don't want to be a slave to my MacBook Pro =)

So I want to start one month with just the basic tools. The first month I tried to use old and new tools because I want to be productive at work. After the first mixed month, I will decide what to do next.
The first month begins today (07/10/2021).]]></summary>

Of course it can do the job, but in my private world, I used to use TravisCI before and now… Azure DevOps for AWS deployments.
And one of great advantages of Azure DevOps is Artifacts, where you can store and publish your packages. Something what we missed in AWS Codepipeline for long time. Until now.
Not long time ago AWS announced this service. Now it is official. And it is a great news, indeed. Until today we had to use workarounds (let’s call it this way). S3 buckets, or build the artifact solution by our own.

Then, simply run this command to add zsh's binary to /etc/shells:command -v zsh | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
Now, set it as your default shell:chsh -s $(which zsh)
Run curl -fsSL https://starship.rs/install.sh | bash to start the installation.

So the concept here is like when in the component we detach the change detector, Angular will not perform change detection for that component and its subtree, and when we reattach it change detection will happen.
GitHub and Stackblitz.
import { ChangeDetectorRef, Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  templateUrl: './child.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./child.component.scss']
})
export class ChildComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor(private cdr:ChangeDetectorRef) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.cdr.detach();
  }
}


`
The parent component has a data variable which we are showing in that component and also passing it to the child component as Input, and the data is displayed on HTML template other than this we have a button in the parent component to increment the value of data and two buttons in the child component one to detach and other to reattach the change detection, the setup will be as below screenshot

Here's what you can accomplish by building notifications:
Drive engagement. Notifications inform customers that there’s something going on in your application that’s worthy of their attention. Timely notifying your audience about valuable content or interactions with other users is great for building trust and engagement.
Enable user journeys based on asynchronous actions. If you don’t expect your users to always be connected to your app or service, notifications enable your users to stay plugged in without having to constantly check for updates in-app.
Support time-sensitive operations. Perhaps you’re planning on requiring two-factor authentication at…]]></summary>

Here's an example:




function add(x) {
return function(y) {
  return function(z) {
    return x + y + z;
  }
}

}
console.log(add(10)(20)(30));

The add(10)(20)(30) should return 60.
This is useful in your program if you can't supply all the arguments to a function at one time. You can save each function call into a variable, that hold's the returned function that takes the next argument when it's available.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this tutorial, I explain one workaround that I did to create one Docker image of one Angular application which has one dynamic API URL.
The article How To Build An Angular App Once And Deploy It To Multiple Environments - Solution 4: Override environment file values explains how you can do this.
But, as I'm far from a Docker expert, I spent some time to create the Dockerfile to do this :)
Just quoting the article:
The idea is to use Angular’s environment.ts (for local development) and environment.prod.ts (for all other stages) with placeholder values which are overwritten per deployment:
export const environment = {
  apiUrl: 'MY_APP_API_URL',
  stage: 'MY_APP_STAGE',
};

If our pod is started we can then run the following script, for example in a Dockerfile, that overrides these placeholder values:
#!/bin/sh
# replace placeholder value in JS bundle with environment specific values
sed -i "s#MY_APP_API_URL#$API_URL#g" /usr/share/nginx/html/main.*.js

Here is the Dockerfile I created to run this workaround:
FROM nginx:latest

COPY dist/your-app-name /usr/share/nginx/html

CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", \
"echo API_URL=[$API_URL], && \
sed -i s#MY_APP_API_URL#$API_URL#g /usr/share/nginx/html/main.*.js && \
nginx -g 'daemon off;'"]

Build your project:
$ ng build

Place this Dockerfile into your Angular root folder and run this to build your image:
$ docker build -t angular/your-app-name .

After this, just run your container passing the API_URL variable:
$ docker run -p 80:80 --name your-app-name -e API_URL=http://localhost:8080 angular/your-app-name]]></summary>

It’s all a black box, breaks with vague error messages, that ultimately lead you down a tunnel of “google and pray”. Unless you’ve spent a lot of time with Webpack, it’s hard to troubleshoot when it inevitably breaks. (and seriously, who freaking has time to learn all the idiosyncrasies of Webpack?)
But even with that, the benefits vastly outpace the drawbacks. When Javascript build tools work, they work beautifully – compiling your scripts down to the smallest size, ensuring that it works on all web browsers, and in the case of WordPress, even automatically enqueuing dependent scripts that are a part of WordPress core.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to the second vue academy ! It will be a list of lot of article on vue! I have 2.5 years of experience in this and I can teach a few thing about this !
For this course we will focus on v-model directive !
First problematic, how do we manage an input value in <input> ?
We could do the next :
<script>
export default {
  name: "HelloWorld",
  data: function () {
    return {
      message: '',
    }
  },
  methods: {
     updateMessage(event) {
         this.message = event.target.value
     }
  },
};
</script>

<template>
<div>
    <input
        :value="message"
        @input="updateMessage"
        >
</div>
</template>

We need to bind value of input to our current data message and handle event from this input in order to update our current data message.
It's not really friendly and we have to do this for every  component...
You can use the v-model directive to create two-way data bindings on form input, textarea, and select elements. It automatically picks the correct way to update the element based on the input type.
So we can replace the code above by
<script>
export default {
  name: "HelloWorld",
  data: function () {
    return {
      message: '',
    }
  },
};
</script>

<template>
<div>
    <input v-model="message">
</div>
</template>

We can remove the method that update value ! Since v-model will directly update it.
It's very useful !]]></summary>

When you have to log, do it consistently.
Logging is necessary. It allows us to debug in both development and production. But console is disallowed by tslint by default. And for good reason. Console logging is a mess most of the time. If you can just willy-nilly console.log(whatever) then your logs are pretty much useless.
We can end up with too much logging in production, which can slow our application down, and not enough in development where we need more details.
I’ve had to deal with this issue on multiple projects and have written a static logger class in Angular that allows us to control what we log and where.
Here is the gist https://gist.github.com/jkyoutsey/e99336d58c2c83bc0ba03cde78fcc64e

Smartphone and tablet use was rising, and the recent completion of the HTML5 specification, together with nice additions such as the web manifest, seemed to pave a path to a bright future. As the hip social network Facebook bet strongly on HTML5 for their mobile application, everything was shipshape.
Then there were some unfortunate setbacks. First, the up-and-coming native app framework PhoneGap did not go anywhere. Facebook then announced they were rewriting their mobile app. HTML5 was not ready yet, they said.
Finally, as Google announced AMP — a subset of HTML5 with some custom elements — no one wanted to bet on HTML as an app platform. Failed experiments such as webOS and Mozilla’s Firefox OS set the transition back ev…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After you've upgraded to Angular v12 from a previous version of Angular, you may notice your ng serve times have increased, along with missing sourcemaps, and longer rebuild times during development. This post helps you set a default configuration to development to get your application serving the same as previously.
In Angular version 12, running ng build now defaults to production mode. This is a welcomed change, as there is less chance of accidentally deploying a development build to production, which is a lot slower and bigger, giving the perception that Angular is slow. This also aligns with other web frameworks that build for production out of the box.
The way Angular serves the application, it essentially does a build with watch mode. As mentioned before, doing a build is now done by default with production optimizations enabled. This adds more time to the build process.
There is a migration to add a "development" build configuration.
To run this migration, run:
ng update @angular/cli --migrate-only production-by-default

One caveat is that it only supports migrating first-party Angular builders for development mode, including:
@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server
@angular-devkit/build-angular:protractor
To fix this manually, you add the development options as defaults, and a defaultConfiguration set to an empty string so it doesn't default to production.
Now, when running ng serve you will get a development build, which is faster for local development.

We have provisioned the following files
for the parts you have selected to edit:


You can now edit part \'mynewapp\' and change
them to your liking.

Remember to pvr commit any changes you might

When done, you can:
1. apply committed changes: exit 0 (or Ctrl-D)
2. discard your changes: exit 1

For help visit: https://pantavisor.io

Often you can just use the container using the default configuration pantavisor linux generated for you.
Once happy you would run:

I have used several password managers for about 4 years, but I've never found the one that fits me. Everyone had some major flaws like it felt outdated or it was too expensive. Then it hit me... why shouldn't I create the next Facebook of password storage?
1. The app must have a generous free tier. I wanted a personal plan, where you can store your passwords safely across multiple devices without hassle.

RAID 0 disk arrays are known for relatively high data access time, and that’s why people choose to use them primarily because of the considerable boost in the speed of read and write operations. However, their reliability and fault-tolerance leave much to be desired. Even if one of the drives is out of order, all the data in such a disk array is going to be lost. Recovering the information from this array type is quite a challenge, but even then, all the data you may be able to extract will certainly be damaged. In fact, this type is not much of a disk array because it offers no redundancy at al…]]></summary>

Ads are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos 🙃
