This is my first time participating Hacktoberfest and I wasn't really sure what to expect. It's very intimidating for me to see so many huge projects that I don't feel like I'm experienced enough to help with, and try to find something in them to help fix or add to. So I wanted to start with something maybe smaller and work my way up to a larger project I am interested in.
It felt a lot harder to find something simple than I expected it to be, there were a lot of cool projects that looked very complicated and I wasn't really sure how to solve their issues. It really helped that my professor taught us how to use GitHub's search features to find specific labels such as the "good firs…]]></summary>

A software bug is an error in a computer program that causes it to produce unexpected results or to behave in a disruptive fashion.
Albeit a bug can be a very innocent flaw, a careless mistake the impact it can have can still be exponentially larger than an exploit due to a big logical error in a code base.
eg. a small rounding error in the calculation of an orbit of a satellite can cause major financial damages with many other implications like space pollution.
Hence, every developer should be aware of basic cybersecurity practices!
How to reduce the number of bugs in your code?

A linked list is a linear data structure that represents a collection of elements that we'll call nodes , where each node points to the next one or previous one, the first node in the linked list is the head and the last is the tail

In the linked list each node must be have the following properties:
The main properties of the linked list are:
Size: The number of nodes in the linked list 
Head: The first node
Tail: The last node
and the main operations of a linked list data structure are: 
insertAt: Inserts a node at the specific index.


removeAt: Removes the node at the specific index.


getAt: Retrieves the element at the specific index.

When you start working as an application security engineer, you'll expect to find straightforward tasks to do. But this is not the case because each company has its vision and strategies to handle data security, which can let us infer that every organization's security maturity may differ from one to another.
Viewing data breaches and cyber incidents all the time proves that no one out there has a mature cyber security program.
If you are already working in this field, I imagine that you sometimes feel that you're achieving nothing and you are more invisible inside the organization. The bigest challenge I see is how to increase your visibility and have more transparency with your manager and the rest of your co-workers.

Recently I found here on dev.to one article talking about the usage of TS generics on React components. As you may notice, I've been working with TS since quite a while, and the first thing that I tried to work with in React was generics, because they are an amazing feature that allows us, component creators, to give some control over the types to end users, component consumers. Maybe we are both, maybe we are one, but no the other. In any way, a good typed component will always help.
But that article wasn't accurate, and it was uncompleted, so if someone else would read it, they will end up with misinformation. And I understand, we all are learning here, we all do mistakes, and that's not as important as it is for we to learn. So, I'm going to show you w…]]></summary>

Proactive Monitoring
Incident Response and Recovery
For example, that recovery can include activities such as handling acute malware or ransomware incidents. 
Remediation Activities 
For Example, using information obtained from log files and other sources, a SOC member can recommend a better network segmentation strategy or a better system patching regimen. Improving existing CyberSecurity is a major responsibility of a SOC. 
Compliance
Organisation secure themselves through conformity to a security policy, as well as external security standards, such as ISO 27001x, the NIST CyberSecurity Framework(CSF) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Organisations need a SOC to help ensure that they are compliant with an important security standards and best practices.

Pagination is the process of separating print or digital content into discrete pages. For print documents and some online content, pagination also refers to the automated process of adding consecutive numbers to identify the sequential order of pages.

Let's say you have a total of 6 items on a page, and you want to only display 3 items at a time (per page). This means we are going to have a total of 2 pages, and if we want to display 2 items per page this means a total of?? you guessed it! 3 pages.

This is a pretty common requirement even for food or hotel business-related websites.
So in this article, we will see how to add a google map with the preferred location on your website.
Create a new folder with the name google-map-location-demo and create an index.html file inside it. Now, type ! (exclamation mark) in the file and press tab, so the default HTML code will automatically be added by emmet.
If you're not aware of emmet and its useful shortcuts, check out my this article.

You can change the title tag content as per your choice.
For this demo, we will show the Eiffel tower's location on the map.
So follow the below steps.
Navigate to https://maps.google.com/ and search for Eiffel Tower in the search box
Now, click on the Share icon and select the Embed a map option
Click on the COPY HTML button to copy the iframe tag into your clipboard
Now, open the index.html file, and inside the body tag, add the copied content

Now, If you open the file in the browser, you will see the map displayed

That's it about this short tutorial.
Check out my recently published Mastering Redux course.
In this course, you will build 3 apps along with a food ordering app and you'll learn:
Basic and advanced Redux
How to manage the complex state of array and objects
How to use multiple reducers to manage complex redux state
How to debug Redux application
How to use Redux in React using react-redux library to make your app reactive.
How to use redux-thunk library to handle async API calls and much more
and then finally we'll build a complete food ordering app from scratch with stripe integration for accepting payments and deploy it to the production.

let obj = {x: 0};
obj.bar = 'Hello';

This will show a editor error in TS
Property 'bar' does not exist on type '{ x: number; }';

This is like TS saying "i can see obj has only one property x of type number,but you are changing "bar" which is not a property of obj hence i am going to show error".
let obj:{x: number, bar?: string}= {x: 0};
obj.bar = 'Hello';

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've talked a good deal about observability, tracing and instrumentation in the past. Recently, I decided to try out some new things in those areas, and here's how it went.
In my app Tentacle, there's an internal Node.js API which is called by the main app from time to time. This API in turn calls other external services, often more than once, and it can take anywhere from one to ten seconds for the whole thing to end, depending on the external services. I wanted to see how I could improve speed. Yes, the external service might be slow, but perhaps there was some way I could improve things on my end—better configuration, improved logic in handling the response, parallelization? I decided to add tracing so I could see if there were bottlenecks I could fix.

What are Operators?
Operators are pure functions. They take observable as input and return output as observable.
map– a transformation operator works similar to Array.prototype.map
switchMap– cancels the inner observable when outer observable emits a value
catchError– catches the error and passes to error handling function
debounceTime– discards values if emitted in less than specified time
takeUntil– automatically unsubscribes from an observable

Initially forkJoin was accepting object arguments as rest parameter. That is deprecated and no longer used.

Part 0 briefly explained the clone syscall. It's like fork/vfork, but with more options to control the child process. Actually, some implementations of fork propagate the call to clone().
Besides controlling which parts of the execution context get shared from the parent process, the clone call offers the possibility for us to create a separate memory block for the child's stack. The nix implementation of clone has the following signature:
pub fn clone(
 cb: CloneCb<'_>,

  Telegraph.nvim


Check out the project readme
I want a simple way to make remaps into shell commands that can open new tmux
For example I want to make remaps to do things like open the current file in lookatme.
# vim :terminal
nnoremap <leader>s <cmd>Telegraph pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark<cmd>

# tmux session
nnoremap <leader><leader>s <cmd>lua require'telegraph'.telegraph({cmd='pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark', how='tmux'})<CR>

# tmux popup
nnoremap <leader><leader>S <cmd>lua require'telegraph'.telegraph({cmd='pipx run lookatme {filepath} --live-reload --style gruvbox-dark', how='tmux_popup'})<CR>

The main goal here is that remaps become one liners that can just be put
init.vim without creating a whole new lua module for each
telegraph takes in a how argument to determine where to tun the command.j
term(default) runs command in the built in terminal
tmux runs command in a new tmux session and joins it.
tmux_popup runs command in a tmux popup window.
tmux_popup_session runs command in a tmux session and displays it in a popup
subprocess runs command in a subprocess
The current set of format strings that can be used with telegraph.  Placing
{} within your command will get rendered into something with
cword - the current word under the cursor
cWORD - the current BIG Word under the cursor
cline - the current line under the cursor
filepath - the filepath of the current file
filename - the filename of the current file
parent - the parent directory of the current file
current_session_name - name of the current tmux session
cwd - the current working directory
Check out the repo and give
it a star if its something that interests you.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently working on my own Arch based Linux Distribution, CalinixOS. Making a distribution was my dream and fulfilling it currently doesn't let my joy stay bound! Its Alpha 5-3rc releases have been published and it's the pretty stable one

What's so special in this distribution?
Just Open the Box. Calinix is Arch, but not necessarily as hard as Arch Installation. Calinix comes with various packages, modern interface and a calamares installer out of the box


Arch without Hassle. Yes, it's based on pure Arch with no custom package control, making your distribution rolling release, reliable and have infinite possibilities


Community Support. Facing a problem? The official developers along with other friendly people of the community await you in the reddit, discord server and forum. We highly care for our community and like to help them in each way we can.


The "Power User" kind-of desktop. With Vim, awesomeWM, Rofi and many other features, Calinix is a perfect choice for the linux "power users", with perfection! Though it shares it's looks with MacOSX, it is a lot more keyboard centric than MacOS
