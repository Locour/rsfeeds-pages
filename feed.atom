API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface. The expansion of the term API may sound a bit complex initially. You may wonder what precisely the Application Programming Interface means? In layman terms, API is a service that allows two or more applications to talk to each other even when they don't speak the same language. An API is an abstraction that allows a way to exchange data between applications written in any language.

awk is a powerfull command line tool found included in all modern GNU/linux distributions. It is often excluded from beginner level Linux tutorials, where more fundamental commands like cd , pwd, ls etc are given more priority, and rightfully so. One must have a good grasp on the basic commmand line tools in order  to harness the full power of awk. 
awk in essence is a pattern scanning and processing language, emphasis on the language part because awk possesses functionality akin to most mainstream programming languages. 
awk loves tabulated data. So to begin with, you'll need a piece of text represented as columns delimited by some common character. You see this pattern often in shells, for instance, the ls -l command that prints file information delimited by a space :

DevOps is now the default approach to agile software development and deployment in most tech companies. With the promise of speed and quality, it seamlessly integrates the functions of development and operations teams to ensure that applications can be continuously pushed out to production. However, the emphasis on speed often comes at the cost of security. Critical vulnerabilities are addressed only late in development, with security patches often being tacked on right before deployment. This is where DevSecOps, also known as Secure DevOps, comes in.
Simply put, DevSecOps is the future of DevOps. DevSecOps involves integrating application security testing earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This notion of shifting security to the left is commonly cal…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With one of my projects ( rocketcrew.space A job board dedicated to the space industry ), I have to collect job offers on career pages of different companies. Every site is different, but each one can be scraped with one of three methods.
The first thing you have to look at when you want to scrape a website is the network tab of the browser dev tools.
Some websites are SSR, short for Server Side Rendered. It means that all the HTML page is generated on the backend. So what we want to scrape can be found directly in the HTML, we just have to parse it.
To do this you can use Axios to get the HTML page, and Cheerio to parse it.
Here is a simple example.
const response = await axios.get(`https://website-url.com`);

const $ = cheerio.load(response.data);
const description = $('#description').html();

The last type of site you can encounter is a SPA ( Single Page Application ). In that case, the server only sends a basic HTML file and the rest of the site is generated with Javascript, client-side.
Here is a little example to get a page h1 text.
const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto("https://website-url.com");

const pageTitle = await page.evaluate(() => document.querySelector("h1").textContent);

await browser.close();

You can use Auth0 to create and maintain your own user store while also providing a secure authentication system on top of it. Auth0 lets you store users in your own database. Furthermore, Auth0 uses OAuth 2.0 as an authorization framework with which you can be confident in terms of security. Using a custom database as a user store in Auth0 facilitates user migration and adds an OAuth and OpenID Connect layer to your existing user database. You can configure any database or web service, including ASP.NET Membership Provider, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, as an Auth0 custom database. In this article, you will learn how to set up PostgreSQL as a custom database for Auth0.

typeof [] === 'array';
// false

typeof [];
// 'object'

To check whether a variable is an array, you'd have to use Array.isArray:
Array.isArray([]);
// true

But why don't arrays have their own type? What are the implications of arrays actually being objects?
In JavaScript, arrays are just special objects that use numerical keys and have their own methods.
Because of this, you can use methods from the Object class on arrays.
let a = [1, 2, 3];

Object.keys(a);
// [ '0', '1', '2' ]

Object.values(a);
// [ 1, 2, 3 ]

As a result, there's also no limitations for the types of values you can store in an array. Other languages, like Java, might require you to only store values of the…]]></summary>

Les principaux acteurs (librairies/frameworks Javascript) y font tous référence dès la page d'accueil.

Même si ces différentes technologies n'embarquent pas les mêmes fonctionnalités, il reste une problématique à résoudre pour tous : le rendu HTML. Nous allons analyser ensemble le fonctionnement d'Angular dans trois cas précis : la gestion des blocs statiques, la mise à jour du DOM et la mise en cache de valeurs.

CLI tools allow you to run certain tasks or operations right from your terminal or command line prompt. As a developer , chances are you spend most of your time in your terminal, typing in commands to help you get around some tasks. A good example of commonly used applications include npm , Create React App , Vue CLI etc.
First , create a directory that will hold the CLI application:
    mkdir todo-list-cli
    cd todo-list-cli

Next, we will initialize our Node.js project
    npm init -y

This will create a package.json file with defaults. Once that is done you need to install some packages that will help create our CLI application. These are:

Our local linux disk volume is under 30GB, so it will be quite challenge for our docker images, which take a lot of space under /var/lib/docker folder and quickly run out of space. 

It is possible to follow this artile - Use a Different Volume For Your Docker Images in Ubuntu that mount a new volume folder e.g. /dev/sda2 for /var/lib/docker and add the following line
/dev/sda2    /var/lib/docker    ext4    defaults    0    1

in /etc/fstab so the mount also happen during startup linux.
A quick tip to get volume type is using command df -T

What I did in fact follow this artile - How to move docker data directory to another loccation on Ubuntu
stop the docker daemon




$ sudo service docker stop

and make sure that docker is not running
$ ps faux | grep -i docker

make the folder and rsync the files




$ mkdir /mnt/docker
$ rsync -avxP /var/lib/docker/ /mnt/docker

Update docker configuration


Add a configuration file and tell the docker daemon what is the location of the data directory by creating a file called daemon.json under directory /etc/docker. the file should have the content:








{
    "data-root":"/mnt/docker"
}

Update the docker service by editing /lib/systemd/system/docker.service
Find the following line




ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock

and update to
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -g /mnt/docker -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock

Re-start the docker daemon




sudo service docker start
# reload docker serivce configuration 
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

test by the following command after you pull an image




docker inspect image_id | grep WorkDir

The docker images under /mnt/docker are gone, e.g. /mnt/docker/overlay2 has no docker images that we pulled fromm DockerHub. 
See github discussion https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/36149
https://github.com/moby/sys/pull/62
No solution yet, keep looking! So far, have to re-pull the docker images.]]></summary>

First let's install TypeScript globally if you don't have it yet.
npm i -g typescript

(By the way, "npm i X" is the short-hand for "npm install X")
Now, let's create your project folder and open it in your beloved editor (mine VS Code)
Let's init the tsconfig file, type the following command
tsc --init

(This "tsc" command will only work if you have typescript globally installed)
It'll create a "tsconfig.json" file. Now, what does it do you ask? TypeScript is the superset of JavaScript and how we want to compile it will be defined by this tsconfig file. The best part is, it'll give you linting (the red lines whenever there is an error in your code or logic) and also explicitly tell you what mistakes you are doing and in some cases possible solutions as well. Amazing right?
Now you created a TypeScript file, wrote your code, for example an app.ts file with this content
console.log('Hello there TypeScript! You are AMAIZING!!')

Now how to run this file? If it were a JavaScript file, like app.js, you might run "node app.js" or "nodemon app.js", right? So let's find the TypeScript versions for those!
Let's install the packages
npm i ts-node ts-node-dev

"ts-node" is the TypeScript version for "node" and "ts-node-dev" is the TypeScript version for "nodemon". So to run the TypeScript file use either of these commands
ts-node app.ts

(Which is basically "node app.js")
ts-node-dev app.ts

(Which is basically "nodemon app.js")
YIPPIE!! You just set up the environment for coding in TypeScript and also learnt how to run those FILES!! YOOOHOOOO!!! But now what?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any starter node.js enthusiastic would at least one time ponder, how can a single thread system out perform better than a MultiThreaded system.
And specially many people from multithreaded pardigm, who are evaluating/understading node.js,  would rather find it hard to understand : why Node.js(or any single threaded non blocking JS system) is acclaimed better than multi-threaded system (At least for serving web-traffic!)?
Node.JS is not faster (doesnot means its slower either), but rather highly efficient in handling a single thread, as compared to a blocking multi-threaded system handling its single thread!
I have made diagrams to explain this statement with analogies.


A multi-threaded blocking system is not capable of utilizing its threads power to its full potential, as a thread is blocked until it evaluates each line of code.
Now offcourse one can build a non blockig system on top of a blocking multi-threaded system (thats what Node.js is under the hood), but its very complex. And you have to do it ever where you need non blocking code in your application or program.
Javascript ecosystem (like nodejs) provide this out of the box as its syntax. The JS language sytanx provide all this feature where ever needed. Morever as its part of its syntax, the reader of the code immeditetly knows that where code is blocking and where its non-blocking.
The blocking part of multithreaded-blocking system makes it less efficient. The thread which is blocked cannot be used for anything else, while its waiting for response.
While a non-blocking single threaded system makes best use of its single thread system.
And hence node.js if used properly can out perform many multi-threaded systems.]]></summary>

The destroyAfterEach Angular testing module teardown option addresses several long-standing issues when using the Angular testbed:
The host element is not removed from the DOM until another component fixture is created
Component styles are never removed from the DOM
Application-wide services are never destroyed
Feature-level services using the any provider scope are never destroyed
Angular modules are never destroyed
Components are destroyed 1 time less than the number of tests
Component-level services are destroyed 1 time less than the number of tests
The two first issues have the biggest impact when using Karma which runs the component tests in a browser.

Here is a Portuguese version.
In my ongoing project, I have a CI/CD flow and one step is responsible to collect the code coverage and validate if I have the minimal value to proceed to another step.
However, even having 84% of code coverage, the SonarQube always returned 30% of the result in the step, because of that the deployment step was never executed. 
I spent some time understanding that the problem was in the Lombok annotations, the SonarQube was computing the generated code.
It's simple to resolve this issue. I created a file named lombok.config inside the folder java (/../src/main/java/lombok.config) with this:
config.stopBubbling = true
lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true

The config.stopBubbling informs the Lombok that the folder where the file is the root and the Lombok don't need to search for more parent folders.
While lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation  put in every generated code by Lombok annotation, another one named @lombok.Generated. This annotation informs Jacoco to not collect coverage from those codes.
Done, problem solved!

It employs a rootkit to conceal its presence and uses different command and control servers for each sample, maintaining a low profile on your system as if nothing is happening will it cause havoc.
It is designed to launch and mediate access to a local SSH server, update itself, and transmit collected credentials. 🔒
FontOnLake is capable of file manipulation, updating itself, and uploading and downloading files
It accepts remote connections, serves as a proxy and can download and run Python scripts, in addition to exfiltrating credentials.

Angular apps consist of various components written with TypeScript or JavaScript. These are decorated with directives for handling things such as binding the HTML or markup to data.

The urge towards adopting microservices architecture has been a welcome trend in the software development industry.  Microservices architecture has been one of the most talked-about technologies in recent times – it has been embraced by many leading organizations worldwide. Originally developed to solve the limitations of monolithic systems, microservices architecture has seen a significant increase in popularity over the last several years, mainly due to increased scalability, flexibility, and performance.
Since microservices-based applications comprise several different services, you often need a common interface or gateway to call these services so that you define and manage all concerns in …]]></summary>

This post outlines what they are, how to identify the different types of keys, where you're likely to find them across the different services, and the order of access precedence for the different SDKs and tools.
AWS Access Keys are credentials used to authenticate to the AWS APIs. Any time you execute the aws command line tools, or use any kind of tool or script that interacts with AWS, access keys are what you use to identify yourself to AWS. They're tied to an IAM principal - either an IAM user or an IAM role. There are, broadly speaking, two primary types of access keys:

Most applications require authentication for gaining access to restricted information or perform tasks. If adequate security is not in place, malicious users can circumvent the authentication process and gain access to these pages by simply skipping the login page and directly calling an internal page that is supposed to be accessed only after authentication has been performed. By directly browsing to the below listed pages without logging in, we are able to access and view its content without logging into the application.
Solution :
Implement session management to ensure that only users logged into the system and with

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Shopping List project is open source and you can find it on GitHub.
There, you are going to find instructions on how to build it and how to run it locally.
The frontend is written in Angular and the backend in Quarkus. The database is PostgreSQL. They are deployed as containers on Heroku and the HTTP communication is protected by JWT tokens.
I describe the technique used to deploy them as containers on Heroku in this article on medium.
You can access this demo version running on Heroku and try it right now. But as this is only a demo, please don't use a real password there!
The application get dormant after some time without use, so the first access can take some extra time.

Shopping List is a web application that was created especially for mobile devices.
You'll be able to organize the products you want to buy and do your shopping more quickly.
Once you create one account, you can create shopping lists and add products to them.
When you're buying products at the market, you can check the products updating your list and switch from one shopping list to other very easily.
You can, for instance, create one shopping list for fruits, other for cleaning products and another for grocery. So, in the top menu, you will be able to switch between these shopping lists while you're checking the products you already bought.

Application
API swagger
I used Angular Material and Angular Flex-Layout in this project.
On the Quarkus project I used Hibernate Panache to control the database and SmallRye JWT to protect the endpoints.
Perhaps you can find it interesting the Swagger-UI, created automatically by the SmallRye OpenAPI, that has the possibility of doing one Authentication to test the endpoints protected by JWT.
Thanks for reading this article and feel free to talk with me in case you got interested in this project!]]></summary>

  Generic CRUD Model


Once we have walked about the theory of generics (Part 1) and we have understand the main CRUD methods (Part 2), now it's time to see it in action.
Before start to implement the generic service of CRUD. We must define the generic model of all resources.
In this article, we assume that all models have some common properties like id, createdAt, and updatedAt.
Thus, we create a generic abstract class that contains all these common properties.

As I always say, Directives are a really powerful feature of Angular. It can be used as an elegant solution to implement a lot of cool functionalities. You can clearly see why the directive approach makes more sense when you reach the end of the post.
Even though it's not that often we see heatmaps in tables, but heatmaps can really add some value in terms of visualization. It would make sense in data sets where there is some kind of comparison or range.

If you have this question in mind, here are some reasons which justify why creating a directive for implementing this feature will make sense.

Bu hata ile karşı karşılaşanlar genelde aşağıdaki iki komutu çalıştırdığında karşılaşmakta:
hostnamectl
timedatectl
Komutlar çalıştırıldığında ise aşağıdaki gibi bir output döndürmekteler.

Bu sorunu çözebilmek için öncelikle dbus adlı servisin çalıştığından emin olunmalıdır.
systemctl status dbus

Eğer bu komut sonrası dönüt aşağıdaki gibi ise servisin bulunmadığını söylemektedir.

Bu durumda aşağıdaki komut ile servis yüklenir:
apt install dbus

Sonrasında servis otomatik olarak active hale gelmiş olabilir. Yine de kesinlik kazandırmak için servisi başlatmalı ve "enable" hale getirmeliyiz. Böylelikle makine her başladığında çalışır duruma gelebilmektedir.
systemctl start dbus
systemctl enable dbus

Eğer "systemctl status dbus" komutunun dönütü aşağıdaki gibi ise servis bulunmakta fakat aktif olmadığı anlamına gelmektedir.

Servis aktif edilir:
systemctl start dbus

Böylelikle dbus servisi sorunu çözümlenmiş olur. Eğer bu işlemlere rağmen çözüm sağlanılmamış ise bunun sebebi /var/run ile /run arasındaki gerekli symbolic linkin bozulmuş olması olabilir. Bunun için aşağıdaki komutlar çalıştırılır ve servisin durumuna bakılır:

sudo ln -s /run /var

It didn't take long until another use case arrived:

Soon after, another use case:

The source code of the application demonstrated in this post present in Github https://github.com/pavankjadda/angular-ssr-docker
If you already have an existing Angular application, you can skip this step
Create new application




   ng new angular-ssr-docker

Add Angular material and




ng add @angular/material

Import indigo-pink theme to application. Add following line to styles.scss




@import "~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css";

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was playing around and testing some stuff in Linux when i suddenly did a tweak which changed how my WSL terminal opens up. This is what my terminal looks like - notice it doesn't the distinct green + blue colors.

After some searching I found two articles (links at the bottom) which describes the "sequence" which Unix follows when reading files. As summary, here's the files (in order):
/etc/profile
~/.bash_profile
~/.bash_login
4 ~/.profile
I added the function for .bashrc at the top of the .bash_profile:
## Loads .bashrc
if [[ -f ~/.bashrc ]] ; then
        . ~/.bashrc
fi

Closed terminal and reopened it 

Adding this great explanation from the reference link:
By default, Terminal starts the shell via /usr/bin/login, which makes the shell a login shell. On every platform (not just Mac OS X) bash does not use .bashrc for login shells (only /etc/profile and the first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile that exists and is readable). This is why "put source ~/.bashrc in your .bash_profile" is standard advice
Why doesn't .bashrc run automatically?
How do I set up my shell execution PATH?

What is the difference between .bash_profile and .bashrc?]]></summary>
