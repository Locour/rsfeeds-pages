Why a plugin system?


Let's say I need to send queries to the database from different modules of my app. Should I connect to db, export the connection, and then import it in all modules where I need to use it? Well, it works but it results in a spaghetti code. This is where Fastify plugin system comes in handy. It let's you to plug ( inject ) your dependencies to Fastify instance and then you can use them wherever you have access to the instance. It also helps you to move from a monolithic structure to microservices easily, because every service can be a plugin itself.
How does a plugin looks like?


A plugin is just a function that takes in fastify and options as inputs.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Concatenation means to join items end to end. JavaScript offers the concat method for both strings and arrays that work in the same way. For arrays, the method is called on one, then another array is provided as the argument to concat, which is added to the end of the first array. It returns a new array and does not mutate either of the original arrays. 
Here's an example:




[10, 20, 30].concat([40, 50, 60]);

The returned array would be [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60].


Now let's use the concat method in the nonMutatingConcat function to concatenate attach to the end of begin. The function should return the concatenated array.




function nonMutatingConcat(original, attach) {
  // Only change code below this line

  // Only change code above this line
}
var first = [1, 2, 3];
var second = [4, 5];
nonMutatingConcat(first, second);

Answer:




function nonMutatingConcat(original, attach) {
  return original.concat(attach)
}

var first = [1, 2, 3];
var second = [4, 5];
console.log(nonMutatingConcat(first, second)); // willreturn  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The slice method as we have already learned about returns a copy of certain elements of an array. It can take two arguments, the first gives the index of where to begin the slice, the second is the index for where to end the slice (and it's non-inclusive). If the arguments are not provided, the default is to start at the beginning of the array through the end. The slice method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one.


Here's an example:




var myarr = ["PS5", "Switch", "PC", "Xbox"];
var myConsoles = myArr.slice(0, 3);

myConsoles would have the value ["PS5", "Switch", "PC"].


Alright then let's use the slice method in the sliceArray function to return part of the anim array given the provided beginSlice and endSlice indices. The function should return an array.




function sliceArray(anim, beginSlice, endSlice) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}
var inputAnim = ["Cat", "Dog", "Tiger", "Zebra", "Ant"];
sliceArray(inputAnim, 1, 3);

Answer:




function sliceArray(anim, beginSlice, endSlice) {
return anim.slice(beginSlice, endSlice);

}
var inputAnim = ["Cat", "Dog", "Tiger", "Zebra", "Ant"];
console.log(sliceArray(inputAnim, 1, 3)); will display ['Dog', 'Tiger']

filter calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new array containing only the elements for which that function returns true. In other words, it filters the array, based on the function passed to it. Like map, it does this without needing to modify the original array.


The variable watchList holds an array of objects with information on several movies. Use a combination of filter and map on watchList to assign a new array of objects with only title and rating keys. The new array should only include objects where imdbRating is greater than or equal to 8.0.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright so continuing where we left off last time, map is a pure function, and its output depends solely on its inputs. Plus, it takes another function as its argument.


You might learn a lot about themap method if you implement your own version of it. It is recommended you use a for loop or Array.prototype.forEach().


Ex:




var s = [24, 55, 96, 4];

Array.prototype.myMap = function(callback) {
  var newArray = [];
  // Only change code below this line

  // Only change code above this line
  return newArray;
};

var new_s = s.myMap(function(item) {
  return item * 2;
});

The Array instance can be accessed in the myMap method using this.




var s = [24, 55, 96, 4];

Array.prototype.myMap = function(callback) {
  var newArray = [];

for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) { // <---
  newArray.push(callback(this[i]))
}
  return newArray;
};

var new_s = s.myMap(function(item) {
  return item * 2;
});

new_s should equal [48, 110, 192, 8].

ls -a for show all folders and files including visible and hidden.
ls -l for show the contents of the directory in full, starting from access rights, owner, group and the date the file or directory was created.
ls -i show directory contents and size.
For troubleshooting you can use command tail -f. Example like this tail -f /var/log/daemon.log.

Simple. It solves your problem. Let's see.
Type checking: This is why typescript really exist. It adds type checking over javascript. It stops you to write stupid code.

Let's see an example:
const addNums = (a, b) => {
    return a + b
}

a and b should be number. But you stupidly pass strings.
addNums('1', '2')

outupt:
'12'

We don't want this to happen. It was a stupid example. But if you are working on bigger project, this kind of bug can happen easily. You waste hours and hours to fix the code. 

This where typescript rescues us with type checking.
const addNums = (a: number, b: number) => {
    return a + b
}

Now if you pass string it will give you error so that you can fix it.

To learn about how Linux came to be, let’s go back to the beginning to 1969 where Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories developed the UNIX operating system. It was later rewritten in C to make it more portable and eventually became a widely used operating system.
A decade or so later, Richard Stallman started working on the GNU (GNU is Not UNIX) project, the GNU kernel called Hurd, which unfortunately never came to completion. The GNU General Public License (GPL), a free software li…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last post, we were creating a common interface for creating express routes, thereby improving reusability. 
We now want to take it up a notch. How about having some fun with Builder Pattern, using plain old Javascript Functions.
So, I created a file RouteBuilder.js and it looks like this.
// RouteBuilder.js
const express = require("express");

const RouteBuilder = function () {
  this.path = undefined; //string
  this.method = undefined; //string
  this.middlewares = undefined; //array of middlewares
  this.controller = undefined; //final request handler
  this.router = express.Router();

  this.setPath = function (path) {
    this.path = path;
    return this;
  };
  this.setMethod = function (method) {
    this.method = method;
    return this;
  };
  this.setMiddlewares = function (middlewares) {
    this.middlewares = middlewares;
    return this;
  };
  this.setController = function (controller) {
    this.controller = controller;
    return this;
  };
  this.build = function () {
    this.router
      .route(this.path)
      [this.method.toLowerCase()](...this.middlewares, this.controller);
    return this.router;
  };
};

module.exports = RouteBuilder;

and you can invoke this RouteBuilder like this
const RouteBuilder  = require('./RouteBuilder');
const authMiddleware = require("../authMiddleware")
const validateMiddleware = require("../validateMiddleware")
const actionMiddleware = require("actionMiddleware")
const serviceMiddleware= require("serviceMiddleware")

const routeBuilder = new RouteBuilder();

const userController = (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({});
};

//build the route
let route = routeBuilder
  .setPath('/')
  .setMethod('GET')
  .setMiddlewares([
    authMiddleware,
    validateMiddleware,
    actionMiddleware,
    serviceMiddleware,
  ])
  .setController(userController)
  .build();

//Finally set the route to the app
app.use("/users", route); // here app is the express app.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently completed an online course and these are my takeaway from Composition and Inheritance.
With inheritance we can extend the functionality of an existing class by overriding its method in a Child class e.g
class Parent {
  function sayHi() {
    console.log("sayHi from Parent");
  }
}
class Child {
  function sayHi() {
    console.log("sayHi from the Child");
  }
}

Inheritance is characterised by an "is-a" relationship between two classes e.g Apple is Fruit, Car is a Vehicle etc. Inheritance is suited for use cases where there is tight coupling between the classes which is rarely the case in the real world.
Lets say your are building a house and you need to model a window in code. So you might come up with following:
class Window {
  height: number;
  width: number;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Socket.IO helps in real-time, bi-directional and event-based communication between the browser and the server. socket.io is available on npm and it can be installed using the command
npm install socket.io

We create a http.server using the http createServer() method.
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer();

To start this server we need to use the listen method.
server.listen(port);

Now initialize the socket.io so that we can start listening the emitted events and also can emit the events. We can use the http.listen.createServer().
const io = require('socket.io')(server);
// create a socket conection 
io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {
// receive the event 'event name' 
  socket.on('event name', function (name) {
    //do action once socket event received
  });
});

There is no need of https.createServer(), http createServer() will work here.
Let's setup the nginx to support the socket.io. If their is only single instance of Nodejs runnig then it won't required any additional configuration but if their is multiple instance running then we need to make changes so that nginx forward the request from client to same port on which it was registered initially else server will send error session id unknown.
 upstream backend {
    ip_hash; // it is required so that socket.io request forward to the same port on which it was registered
    server ip_address;
}

server {

Sometimes we create promises that take too long to finish and we don't want to wait. For example, if we want to make a request and the response takes 20 seconds to finish and for any reason we may want to throw an error in the first 5 seconds and proceed to the next code block.
In this article, we will see how to implement a promise which throws an error after a specific time span. It supports typings with the power of Typescript and accepts a custom error to be thrown when the time comes.
First of all, we create a new promise that rejects an error after a time span in milliseconds. The return type of the timeout promise is never which represents the type of values that never occur. For instance, never is the return type for a function expression or…]]></summary>

But yet, sometimes, these experiences are interrupted by moments of frustration. For example, maybe the library you have just pulled from npm does not expose type declarations? Or perhaps TypeScript is not aware of a global variable you know exists?
If that describes your experiences, read on. The following contains tips regarding extending TypeScript type declarations. I believe that by following them, the number of frustrations you experience while working with TypeScript will drastically decrease.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been very much avoiding using Typescript for quite a while, not because I don't believe in statically typed software, I spent a decade in production Java and was a certified PERL developer. I just never found a reason to use it, being a content creator and Jamstack developer for the past 3 years I have just been using JavaScript without much issue. If I ended up working on a project with typescript I just understood the system coded and moved on. 
When I started writing Collabstream, I wrote an early implementation in JavaScript that used about 30 components, and a half dozen hooks with a bunch of API calls that required specific types. I was trying to pass props and data around and at least 30% of the time I was struggling to keep what variable type was supposed to where. I managed to finish the early POC but probably added hours of development time for no reason. I decided the POC worked really well but the code was an absolute mess, it was probably the worst "production" code I've written. I am okay with this, POC's sometimes need to be dirty to see if what you originally came up with works and can scale.  One of the two was true, it worked but the scaling in it's current form would make any dev team run off and live in a hut in the woods with no electricity. 
This is a simple answer, no. It has a time and a place, and I evaluate it on a case by case basis with a few simple questions:
Am I making a tutorial? 
Does this need scale?
Is this a node package?
I will never make a tutorial in TypeScript unless is a specific tutorial on Typescript as it makes the barrier to entry higher. If it's a node package, it makes sense to be in TypeScript as it provides auto completion of what I am expecting.

  How do reverse shells work?


To make a connection to a typical remote shell, a machine controlled by the attacker connects to the remote network host and it requests a shell connection.

But what if the remote host is not directly accessible, like it has public IP or is protected by a firewall?
In this situation reverse shells maybe shouldn't be used, where the target machine initiates connection to the listening network host a shell is now established.
To start you need a listener process on their system to listen the reverse shell connections incoming to their IP address, Eg, 12.12.12.12

The netcat listener will listen at port 7070. An attacker needs to execute the code to the listener. Many reverse shells needs programming langs

A personal access token (PAT) is used as an alternative to using a password to authenticate into Azure DevOps. When you're working with third-party tools, APIs or the command line that don't support Microsoft or Azure AD accounts or you don't want to provide your primary credentials to the tool, you can make use of PATs.
PATs are easy to create when you need them and easy to revoke when you don’t.

When creating a new PAT you can select the organization where you want to use the token, and then choose a lifespan for your token. Say for example making it only active and usable for a period of 30 days. A PATs lifetime can be extended if needed, but cannot be longer than the maximum period of 1 year. You can also specify granular permissi…]]></summary>

The average person has to keep track of approximately 100 passwords and spends almost 13 minutes every week resetting those passwords. Due to this friction, password reuse is a major issue with over two-thirds of end users reusing passwords across sites, creating widespread security vulnerabilities. The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) found that credential vulnerabilities are involved in more than 80% of all data breaches. Since password reuse is so common, a single compromised password can endanger multiple accounts. 
Auth0 was the first IAM system to build support for passwordless authentication, and all of these reasons are as pertinent as ever:
Passwords are insecure: users pick insecure passwords and reuse them across sites. Since data breaches are common and they frequently include password information, this creates a situation where more and more sites are vulnerable to hacking attempts.
Passwords are expensive to manage: users forget them, and resetting passwords can be an expensive and time-consuming process.
Passwords negatively impact customer retention: remembering and typing a password, particularly on a phone keyboard, carries friction, and can cause returning customers to abandon the login flow, therefore impacting retention.
We believe that moving away from passwords as an authentication method is key to making the internet safer while reducing friction and positively impacting user acquisition and retention. 
Since our initial release, the authentication industry has been hard at work finding better ways to implement passwordless authentication. For example, the FIDO Alliance successfully led the specification and implementation of WebAuthn. In the last few years, Webauthn has been implemented in all major OS/browsers, with iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 being the latest to join the party in September 2020.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Angular’s Core contains most of the functionalities you might need in your application, while with React and Vue, you have to find external libraries, maintained by independent contributors. Therefore, when working with React and Vue, you have to be more careful when choosing libraries, being aware that libraries with a poor maintenance might be deprecated in future.
To build an app with Angular you have to learn Typescript, which is a superset of JavaScript, while with Vue and React you can use pure JS. Regarding the view, with Angular and Vue you write it with HTML, where in React you have to write JSX, which is a syntax that allows coexistence between HTML and JS. Thus, Angular and Vue are ideal if you want to reuse HTML from a huge codebase.
Vue and React use a Virtual DOM (VDOM), which is a node tree listing content, and elements and their attribute as objects and properties. The browser DOM is not updated directly but instead, they use the VDOM as abstraction layer. On the other hand, Angular is based on the MVC pattern and manipulates the DOM directly. Changes in your application will update it without any middleware.
As common, when creating our apps, the components will have their scoped state, and Angular, and Vue works in a way that the data is mutable. User inputs and code can modify the state directly. In React, the state is immutable. To update it, you have to use a specific function that will do it asynchronously.
Angular and React have a powerful community behind. Angular was created by Google, and React by Facebook. Therefore, both have longer life expectancy. Whereas Vue, is an open source project, created by Evan You. Nevertheless, Vue gained a huge fame, because the creator’s idea was to take the best of the other two.
