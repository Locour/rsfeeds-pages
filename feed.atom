        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post I'm going to show you how to disable a repository in Azure DevOps and prevent users from accessing its contents.
As usual, if you are a visual learner, or simply prefer to watch and listen instead of reading, here you have the video with the whole explanation and demo, which to be fair is much more complete than this post.




Link to the video: https://youtu.be/G_um1mm7LiM
If you rather prefer reading, well... let's just continue :)
Before we talk about how to disable a repo, why would you want to do it?
Well, for example you may want to disable a repository because you found a secret in it. Or a third-party scanning tool found the repository to be out of compliance.
In such cases, you may want to temporarily disable the repository while you work to resolve the issue.
Let's see now how to disable a repo. It is very easy.
Just go to the Project Settings, scroll down to the Repositories section and enter it, then click on the specific repo you want to Disable. In the settings, you have the Disable Repo switch

When a repo is disabled, it still shows up in the list of repos, however no one can access or update its content.
And you would also see a message saying that the repo has been disabled when they try to access it in the Azure Repos UI.

And of course after the necessary mitigation steps have been taken, disabled repositories can be re-enabled using the same setting.
Final note: you can disable a repository only if you are either admin or owner, or you have the Delete repository permissions.
Let me know in the comment section below if you think this is useful and if you've ever been in a situation in which you could have disabled a repo.

The virtual DOM is a tree of virtual nodes that represents what the DOM looks like. virtual nodes are light, stateless, and are JavaScript objects that only contain necessary fields. virtual nodes can be assembled into trees, and "diffed" to make pinpoint changes to the DOM.
The reasoning behind this is because modification and access of DOM nodes is computationally expensive. A diff between virtual nodes, accessing the DOM only for modification, is the premise of virtual DOM. It avoids the DOM as much as possible, favoring plain JavaScript objects instead, making reading and writing much cheaper.
The Million virtual DOM contains three main functions: m, createElement, patch. To completely understand how virtual DOM works, let's t‚Ä¶]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A stack uses LIFO (last-in-first-out) ordering, the most recent item added is the first item to be removed, just like a real stack.

A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list, can be either fixed or dynamic size.
Push - Add an item to the top of the stack
Pop - Remove the top item from the stack
Peek - Return the top of the stack, without removing it.
isEmpty - Return true if the stack is empty.
isFull - Return true if the stack is full, used when the stack is fixed size.
Here's an implementation of a stack using an array, in Typescript an array doesn't have a fixed length, so the operation isFull is not required, however you can implement a stack with a fixed length and use that operation.
class Stack<T> {
  private array: T[] = [];

  pop(): T | undefined {
    if (this.isEmpty()) throw new EmptyStackException();

    return this.array.pop();
  }

  push(data: T): void {
    this.array.push(data);
  }

  peek(): T {
    if (this.isEmpty()) throw new EmptyStackException();

    return this.array[this.array.length - 1];

In these upcoming posts, you'll learn the core concepts of Functional Programming including pure functions, how to avoid mutations, and how to write cleaner code with methods like .map() and .filter().
Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT

Functional programming is about:
Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change


Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

After installation dependencies have done, Create an index.js file and put the codes below into it:

  return caption;

}

function getVideoLinkFromHtml(html) {
  let crop = "{\"" + html.substring(html.search("video_url"), html.search("video_url") + 1000);

  crop = crop.substring(0, crop.search(",")) + "}";

  return JSON.parse(crop).video_url;
}

(async ()=>{
    await getPostLink(instagramPostLink);
})();


Some trouble with download the Instagram app is it needs a login, So we are use the embed Instagram posts to download that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to the weird notes of a new DevOps and Backend engineer. This is my (quite open) notebook on what was all the stuff I read and learnt. Not necessarily tech, you can just read on and understand what I am rambling on about.
I finally created my own Docker image of a gin-app and deployed it in a kubernetes pod.
The biggest challenge? Connecting the 2 pods, our otlp-example and the opentelemetry-collector. 
I needed to connect from pod A to port 4317 of pod B. Ofcourse, i had exposed the port in pod B using NodePort yet it didn't seem to work.
What finally worked? Instead of using 0.0.0.0:4317, I just needed to use otel-collector.observability.svc.cluster.local:4317 psst, it's the port name (or deployment name? not sure) , then namespace, then service and so on, which is exposed by a Node Port in this other service.
MAN ELASTIC APM IS AMAZING. LIKE. SO AMAZING TO LOOK AT THE TRACING <3





  
  
  Stuff I need to check out tomorrow? üìÖ



Plan on figuring out how to collect logs from a pod using fluentD and exporting it to our dear openetelemetry-collector. 
Use env vars to toggle the GRPC connection port.
Nothing today
Thanks for listening to the rant.

One of these greeters is the previously known as lightdm webkit2 greeter, then named lightdm web greeter, a greeter that allows theming with web technologies like HTML and JavaScript.
Sadly, this greeter was abandoned as Antergos team didn‚Äôt have time to develop their distro. The latest version, 2.2.5 uses an outdated WebKit engine, which could cause some new web technologies to not work in the greeter. Also, the Debian package is not working, a shame.
Luckily, Antergos team were developing a 3.0.0 version, getting rid of WebKit and using the QtWebEngine, based on Chromium, with Python. So, I decided to update some things about this greeter based on this pre-release.
Whither is the ‚Äúnew‚Äù tool that 3.0.0 would be using, developed by Antergos, allows to create web applications in a similar way to Electron.js, but in Python.
So, I‚Äôm here to introduce a new pre-release. You can install it from the GitHub Repository. Though, you need to install the whither sdk to run it.
Command line arguments support, such as ‚Äî-help, ‚Äî-theme, ‚Äî-debug and others
Some fixes with the LightDM API, as power functions didn‚Äôt work
Man pages updated
Every local request is made through web-greeter:/ url scheme
WebKit no longer here. Replaced with Chromium
Some API changes. 2.2.5 deprecated functions and globals were removed
If you are using LightDM, I recommend you to use this greeter, try some themes and create your own!

Three types of ports are:
Open Port: A port is open, and someone has left the door unlocked.
Closed Port: A closed port is a black hole that's open to attack. Administrators should block ports at the firewall level, and this could be exploited if an attacker has compromised another system. This can cause problems for networks because they'll have no way of knowing what kind of traffic will come in or out on these vulnerable holes across their firewalls

Having control over who can access your API is a necessary requirement to make your application secure. This article will show you how to restrict access to your ASP.NET Web API to authorized users only.
Let's start by setting up the ASP.NET Web API application to be protected. You can download a glossary Web API from this GitHub repository by running the following command in a terminal window:
git clone --branch starter --single-branch https://github.com/auth0-blog/glossary-web-api-aspnet.git


This ASP.NET application provides you with a CRUD Web API to manage a glossary of terms. You can learn the details of its implementation by reading this article.
Once you download the application, move to the glossary-web-api-aspnet folder and launch it by typing dotnet run in a terminal window. By pointing your browser to https://localhost:5001/swagger, you should see a page like the following to interactively test the APIs:

The Web API application allows you to get a list of term definitions or a single term definition. It also lets you create a new definition and modify or delete an existing one.
The current implementation of this glossary Web API allows anyone to perform all the available operations on the glossary. Most probably, you want to allow everyone to get a single glossary item or the full glossary. Still, only authorized users should be enabled to create, update, and delete glossary items.
Let's go and see how to protect these three actions by integrating your ASP.NET Core Web API with Auth0 services.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Network security is the practice of preventing and protecting against unauthorized intrusion into corporate networks. As a philosophy, it complements endpoint security, which focuses on individual devices; network security instead focuses on how those devices interact, and on the connective tissue between them. 
According to the SANS institute Network security is the process of taking physical and software preventative measures to protect the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, malfunction, modification, destruction, or improper disclosure, thereby creating a secure platform for computers, users, and programs to perform their permitted critical functions within a secure environment. 
A brief network security consists of Three layers, Protection, Detection, and Reaction. This is a kind of defense-in-depth strategy. But a system should not rely on a single line of the defense system, rather it should have multiple defense strategies lined up. 
So how can you test your network and security skills, there is a perfect website to validate your skills and prove yourself as a network and security expert. You can visit Free Tech Exams website and attend CompTIA, A+, Network+, and Security+ Practice Test and Exam. They also provide certification on completion of your test. Each segment is consisting of 10 tests you can practice to. Good luck with becoming a network expert.]]></summary>

Everyone is aware that the any type is a bad thing because it would basically be like coming back to Javascript where there's¬†no strong type check and¬†anything is allowed.
But even if we respect this rule, we can fall into another pitfal where we break Typescript's type-check by casting types. Following chapter will describe you why and how to avoid it.
Type creation can be done in several ways in typescript. It can be anonymous, interface/class declarations, type aliases, duck-typings, etc. (See everything in the doc)
But when it comes about typing a variable, there's one syntax only which is with colon :.
const mystring: string = 'hello'; // this example could be duck-typed, but yeah, focus on the colon

  Intro


Recently, I started working on this cool project, a Web Based Code Editor. So, in this post I will talk about how I implemented this project and what will be the further features I will be adding. üòÉ
As we all know there are thousands of AWESOMEEE code editors out there like repl.it, codepen, codesandbox, etc. So most you must be wondering why I decided to write my own code editors.
 
What I think is, if you build a system then you will get to know how that thing really works, so my curiosity made me do it. üôÇ
Lets talk about the features this web app currently has,
Separate tabs for HTML/CSS/JS for better coding style.
Code Output Display, shows the output by merging all codes and creating a Virtual DOM.
Fully Mobile Responsive.
Download merged code as text file.
Night Mode
Code auto save in browser
Code Sharing Link (Planned)
Code Collaboration (Planned)
In this project, I have used,
React - For UI
Material UI - Design/Animation
Redux - For State Management
Redux Saga - For Side Effects
Redux Persist - For Auto Save
Socket IO (Planned) - For socket connection
JsDiff - For Calculating Difference

Multi-Region keys are a set of interoperable KMS keys that have the same key ID and key material, and that you can replicate to different Regions within the same partition. With symmetric multi-Region keys, you can encrypt data in one Region and decrypt it in a different Region.

However, I want to start moving to Linux (Ubuntu) which I installed on my PC a while back, so, I recently tried making a new file ("extensionless"), and I wanted to make it a different type, so I tested to see if that would work by testing by renaming it .go, so I could try to open it in VSCode like I normally would on WIndows.
I look up multiple searches, involving how to change the file extension (only getting results using command line), and eventually coming over to a horrifying S.O. answer that horrified me, it gave me the info that "extensions" (file types) are determined by header.
There doesn't seem to be any way in the "Files" file manager for Ubuntu to change the header type.

What I want is a program that can give me a simple GUI to edit the file type of a file so I can easily go between one or the other as needed/wanted.

So simply put, if the Sanity team doesn't have experience with China, you are unlikely to get good support from them. If you are just testing Sanity out, and don't need your site to be highly available in China. It doesn't hurt to try.
Since the Sanity CMS is based on GCP (Google Cloud Platform), if GCP has good support in China, we probably can still use it in production, but what we found was this: 
" Google does not offer and has not offered cloud platform services inside China and Google Cloud is not weighing options to offer the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in China."
Google's Media Statement
So this looks like Sanity CMS doesn't work in China by "words" and it is also not in the coverage area of the Sanity and GCP. The next thing we want to know is: if a website is published with Sanity CMS, whether the site can be loaded in China or not. More specifically, how fast the site loads in China. Here are the speed test results:

Here's when you start to think about potential solutions as well: Maybe it's time to add state management to the application?  Is it a good time to build a "custom" solution? What about using some design patterns in this case?
The answers to these questions will depend on the complexity of the current scenario, the experience of the developers, or on the opinions of the team. It is clear that there is no absolute answer!
In this article, we'll go over how to communicate between components using a custom Event Bus implementation.
The Event Bus idea is generally associated with the Publish-subscribe pattern:

Personally, I really love TypeScript and the Redux/Reducer patterns, because they give me a great Developer Experience with TypeScript and a lot of autocompletion available, quite useful in order to not get bit by a bug caused by a typo, and really convenient as I don't have to explore files constantly in order to know what are the properties that a certain object should have.
I always prefer to use TS over vanilla JS, so, it makes a lot of sense to try to make use of strict typing, even in a concept app. Also, while vanilla useReducer might not be what most projects use, I still want to share how I found it to be pretty useful in this context.

Even without using a library, just using pure React, you can basically go two ways: controlled or uncontrolled. We will briefly discuss this, so if you're new to React, you might want to start there. 
If you already know all about controlled VS uncontrolled forms, you can skip the first part and jump right to the second one, where I will show you how I like to build my forms today: using react-hook-form, yup and TypeScript. Those tools allow me to quickly build any type of form w‚Ä¶]]></summary>

There are ways, however, to use the internet with insane mathematics in your favor to ensure that no one can see whatever it is that you‚Äôre sending to someone else.
Cryptography is an ancient mathematical science that was originally used for military communications, and designed to conceal the contents of a message should it fall into the hands of the enemy. Recent developments in cryptography have added additional uses, including mechanisms for authenticating users on a network, ensuring the integrity of transmitted information and preventing users from repudiating (i.e. rejecting ownership of) their transmitted messages.

Security+ certification is in high demand and maintains to serve as a fundamental certification for experts beginning an IT career or others looking to construct a profession in cybersecurity. On top of that, Security+ certification is also authorized using the Department of Defense (DoD) to satisfy Directive 8570.01 -M requirements.

If you‚Äôre looking for employment within the government, then it's far a required certification. CompTIA Security+ SY0-501 is the present-day Security+ examination and maybe to be had to take till the Spring of 2021. However, the Security+ SY0-601 is scheduled to be launched in October of 2020. If you‚Äôre an IT security professional and you‚Äôre seeking to decide which certification is nice for you or if you‚Äôre simply trying to research extra about every examination, check out the statistics under:
The SY0-501 examination specializes in these talent regions:
‚Ä¢ Threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities
The SY0-601 Exam will cover the equal talent regions pondered within the SY0-501. However, some of these areas will consist of extra information. Expect to see changes in the following regions:
‚Ä¢ Threats, assaults, and vulnerabilities
‚Ä¢ Cloud assist
Also, expect to peer extra overall performance-based questions (PBQs) on SY0-601.
Professionals need to determine to take every examination based on their man or woman's needs and timeline. Both assessments will train you on how to recognize and manipulate security threats, but if you‚Äôre equipped properly now SY0-501 is the most effective examination to be had until October.
If you can wait till October, the SY0-601 will include updates based totally on the nature of the current cyber protection environment and troubles that cyber protection specialists are combating these days. If you decide to put together for SY0-601 make certain that your examination education is appropriate to that exam!]]></summary>

Developers can create performant and reactive forms that provide great UI/UX. One part of the reactive form toolkit that I think people often overlook is creating custom validators. In this article I show how to create a custom password field validator and how to use it.
Reactive forms create objects that all inherit from the same AbstractControl. The AbstractControl has an errors object property, which is where I can get or set validation errors for the form or particular control. This errors object contains key value pairs. When using the default built-in validation, these key value pairs are predefined with specific (often boolean) values. That means that I would need to evaluate the ‚Ä¶]]></summary>

To define which SSH keys have access to your server, each server user has its own directory and within, a folder called .ssh. This folder should have a file called authorized_keys and the purpose of this file is to hold the public key for each SSH key that should have access.
It's a very simple system that works great, as it's a simple case of adding a new public key on a new line in the file and saving it, (or deleting a line to remove access).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
Thank you @Zenigata]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a "pseudo" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.]]></summary>
