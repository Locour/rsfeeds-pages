Reinstalling your favorite operating system or changing to another one, accidentally removing a partition from the hard disk, taking a wrong step while working in a partition manager utility, hardware issues, bad blocks – these are only a few things that may cause partitions to become unreadable. The main cause behind partition loss is logical errors in partition tables.
A partition table is a special system file containing settings that contain information about the hard disk drive’s partitions, including the beginning and the end of the disk, the file system, the name, size and many other …]]></summary>

You are using nginx and trying to call the downstream application but it returns http 502.
Cause
The reason could be because SELINUX would have blocked certain port. You can check the logs for more details.
Steps
The following example is from a sample repo whereby the downstream application uses port 801 and 802.
1) Check the ngnix logs — /var/log/ngnix/error.log
From here you will be able to see the error “permission denied”

2) Check the audit log — /var/log/audit/audit.log
Command:
sudo cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep nginx | grep denied


3) Check the ports that are allowed.
Command:
semange port -l | grep http


4) You can allow them for testing if it’s a legit request. 
Command:
semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 801]]></summary>

If this is your first time using the CDK, bootstrap your AWS account. The Prerequisites section in this guide has the steps.

If Apache DocumentRoot is not the default /var/www/html, it could be a NFS/EFS share. 


Then you might encounter “Permission denied for Apache HTTPD” error when accessing the site.



Solution:
Check your DocumentRoot setting to confirm it is not the default by running below command.




grep -i ‘DocumentRoot’ /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

In output, you might see the DocumentRoot location as “/data/docs/demo” (this is a NFS share)


By default NFS share access will be denied. This can be confirmed by running below command.




getsebool -a | grep httpd_use_nfs

It will give result “httpd_use_nfs → off”


To enable it, run the command,




sudo setsebool -P httpd_use_nfs 1

Fortunately, thanks to the npm package system, you can download any package in one command line. Today in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to publish your package to npm, so that it's available to everyone. 
The first thing you will need is to have Node.js installed on your machine. To do this, go to the official Node.js website, and download the latest version.
The second thing you will need is an npm account. If you don't have one, you can create one for free on this page: https://www.npmjs.com/signup. This step is essential as you can only publish packages if you are logged in. Once you have created your account, and validated your email address (required), memorize your username and pa…]]></summary>

Usually, attacker will use a bot to try and crack our web app. One solution is to also include a honeypot everywhere there is a form. This will not deter all of the bot but adding that extra layer of security will not hurt right. Honestly, so far we made it so that we have incremental security measure in place. 
I think this is where I should say that, in security terms, there is nothing that is truly secure but we need to just slowdown the attack as much as we can to the point it doesn't make any sense for the attacker to continue. 
pipenv install django-honeypot
pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    #...

    # django-honeypot
    'honeypot',
    #...
]

if you want to activate the honeypot web app wide, the easiest way was to use a middleware provided by django-honeypot
MIDDLEWARE = [
    #...

    # Django-honeypot
    # https://pypi.org/project/django-honeypot/
    'honeypot.middleware.HoneypotMiddleware',

    #...
]

lastly add this variable to your settings.py file
# Django-honeypot
# https://pypi.org/project/django-honeypot/
HONEYPOT_FIELD_NAME = "secret_key"

As of right now I feel that we made our web app a bit safer. I'm not gonna say that our code is safe from any bot attack but at least the normal to medium type bot.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the month of June of 2019 raspberry Pi foundation introduced a new model of SBC(single board computer) named 'Raspberry Pi 4 (model B)',  which was 50% more powerful and 30% more efficient than its previous version. this was one of among most powerful ARM devices in the first two decades of 21st century.
Spec.: 

         RAM: 1GB/2GB/4GB/8GB (DDR4)
         CPU: 4 cores (ARM cortex A72)
         Clock Speed: 1.5gHz
         Storage type: micro SD card, USB(external)
         Wireless connectivity: bluetooth 2.4/5 gHz, Wifi 802.11ac

 I/O: 
 


         2x USB type-A (3.0)
         2x USB type-A (2.0)
         1x USB type-C 
         1x Ethernet port (RJ-45)
         2x micro HDMI
         1x headphone jack (3.0)
         1x CSI connector
         1x DSI connector
         40x GPIO pin
         4x PoE hat

 software: 

 pros. 
       •  Most powerful Raspberry Pi to date.
       •  Offered in three RAM amounts.
       •  Supports two 4K external displays.
       •  Gigabit Ethernet jack onboard.
       •  USB 3.0 support.

 cons. 
       •   Needs fan and case.
       •   No built-in storage.
       •   Alternate operating systems need higher-spec, more expensive versions.

 pricing:  
    (from electronicscomp.com)

     •   1 GB - ₹2690.00 (tax excluded)
     •   2 GB - ₹3085.00 (tax excluded)
     •   4 GB - ₹4185.00 (tax excluded)
     •   8 GB - ₹5695.00 (tax excluded)

 conclusion: 
 
             

As an educational & development and introductory computer, it's hard to bet to Raspberry Pi. Every new release has managed to do more without fundamentally changing the size of the board, adding more powerful features day by day while still supporting the same interface for third party hardware, supporting a wide range of Operating Systems. As someone who grew up with 1980s 8-bit or 16-bit computers, there's a certain nostalgia in a device like this, but this category of hardware clearly looks forward, building on its heritage and aiming to encourage more developer and engineers.]]></summary>

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.
A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.

Actually 'sudo' command provides administrator privileges. When we create a new server it has a default 'root' user. So, here I'm going to create a new user with sudo access.
Open your terminal and write the following command
root@localhost:~$ adduser [username] 



Set the password and confirm the password again.

Now you need to give 'sudo' permission to the newly created user. So, use the usermod command in the terminal. Command is given bellow -
root@localhost:~$ usermod -aG [username] 

Now, the new user added to the sudo group. you can check by this command -
root@localhost:~$ su - [username] 

And run any command with 'sudo' in the terminal -
 username@localhost:~$ sudo apt-get update 

If you want to add sudo to the existing user then just follow the step three.

  The following are the steps to setup the dev environment {


• install node 
to compile the file and automatically you should have a JavaScript file created 
• enables you to add multiple values in one variable


• allows you to add multiple core types


 • enum helps you delaring set of named constants

Use COPY src src.
Refer to the Sysdig's post.
COPY . . will place credentials in container by default. You will need to configure .dockerignore to avoid this. However, managing .dockerignore is tedious and easy to make mistake. This is just like .gitignore.
Whitelist copying like COPY src src and copy build build never cause this problem.
The files required by a command are different by step. For example, npm install requires only package.json and package-lock.json. Overwriting them in a later step by COPY . . may cause a consistency problem. In addition, not the builder container but only the runner container requires the files under src in Node.js, Ruby, Python, and so on with builder pattern. 
I suggest to use whitelist copying to avoid some security problems. Build time will become shorter as a bonus.]]></summary>

Once a hacker is able to gain access to the admin page, the fear would be the hacker is able to exfiltrate all our user Personal Information (PI). 
There are many propose solution to keep the web app admin pages safe. The propose solutions are:
But you know what, no matter how you handle securing the web app admin site. There will always be someone who will try to gain access to your website. Why not have a little fun and set up a honeypot for them. What a honeypot you may ask? A simple way of explaining it in layman terms is that its a lure for our hacker to try and attack us.
One package we can use as a honeypot is called django-admin-honeypot. Its a simple package that will replace the real admin page with a face one and register all IP that try to access the page.
Installing django-admin-honeypot is just a simple as :
pipenv install django-admin-honeypot
pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt

add admin_honeypot in INSTALLED_APP located in settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    #...

    # Django-admin-honeypot
    'admin_honeypot',

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', include('admin_honeypot.urls', namespace='admin_honeypot')),
    path('secret/', admin.site.urls),
    #       ^-- Change this to anything you like eg:secret

This document is to evaluate and provide guidance on the benefits/feature of Amazon S3’s SRR and CRR replication strategy.


Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets. Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts.


Replication can be achieved within the same AWS Region or different AWS Region.



Use Cases

Same-Region Replication (SRR)
Automatically replicates data between buckets within the same AWS Region.
Replication can be setup at a bucket level, a shared prefix level, or an object level using S3 object tags.
SRR can be use to make a second copy of data in the same AWS Region.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) is often used to group related functionality into a single object or module. 
Ex:




let isCuteMixin = function(obj) {
  obj.isCute = function() {
    return true;
  };
};
let singMixin = function(obj) {
  obj.sing = function() {
    console.log("Singing to an awesome tune");
  };
};

We can group these mixins into a module as follows:




let funModule = (function() {
  return {
    isCuteMixin: function(obj) {
      obj.isCute = function() {
        return true;
      };
    },
    singMixin: function(obj) {
      obj.sing = function() {
        console.log("Singing to an awesome tune");
      };
    }
  };
})();

Note that you have an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that returns an object funModule. This returned object contains all of the mixin behaviors as properties of the object. The advantage of the module pattern is that all of the motion behaviors can be packaged into a single object that can then be used by other parts of your code.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A common pattern in JavaScript is to execute a function as soon as it is declared:




(function () {
  console.log("Chirp, chirp!");
})();

This is an anonymous function expression that executes right away, and outputs Chirp, chirp! immediately.
Note that the function has no name and is not stored in a variable. The two parentheses () at the end of the function expression cause it to be immediately executed or invoked. This pattern is known as an immediately invoked function expression or IIFE.


Let's rewrite the function makeNest and remove its call so instead it's an anonymous immediately invoked function expression (IIFE).




function makeNest() {
  console.log("A cozy nest is ready");
}

makeNest();

Answer:




(function () {
  console.log("A cozy nest is ready");

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the previous post, bird had a public property name. It is considered public because it can be accessed and changed outside of bird's definition.




bird.name = "Duffy";

Therefore, any part of your code can easily change the name of bird to any value. Think about things like passwords and bank accounts being easily changeable by any part of your codebase. That could cause a lot of issues.


The simplest way to make this public property private is by creating a variable within the constructor function. This changes the scope of that variable to be within the constructor function versus available globally. This way, the variable can only be accessed and changed by methods also within the constructor function.




function Bird() {
  let weight = 15;

  this.getWeight = function() {
    return weight;
  }
}
let ducky = new Bird();
console.log(ducky.getWeight()); // will display 15

Here getWeight is a privileged method, because it has access to the private variable weight. This is possible because weight is declared in the same context as getWeight. In JavaScript, a function always has access to the context in which it was created. This is called closure.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you have seen, behavior is shared through inheritance. However, there are cases when inheritance is not the best solution. Inheritance does not work well for unrelated objects like Bird and Airplane. They can both fly, but a Bird is not a type of Airplane and vice versa.
For unrelated objects, it's better to use mixins. A mixin allows other objects to use a collection of functions.




let flyMixin = function(obj) {
  obj.fly = function() {
    console.log("Flying, wooosh!");
  }
};

The flyMixin takes any object and gives it the fly method.




let bird = {
  name: "Donald",
  numLegs: 2
};

let plane = {
  model: "777",
  numPassengers: 524
};

flyMixin(bird);
flyMixin(plane);

Here bird and plane are passed into flyMixin, which then assigns the fly function to each object. Now bird and plane can both fly:




bird.fly();
plane.fly();

The console would display the string Flying, wooosh! twice, once for each .fly() call.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In previous posts, you learned that an object can inherit its behavior (methods) from another object by referencing its prototype object:




ChildObject.prototype = Object.create(ParentObject.prototype);

Then the ChildObject received its own methods by chaining them onto its prototype:




ChildObject.prototype.methodName = function() {...};

It's possible to override an inherited method. It's done the same way - by adding a method to ChildObject.prototype using the same method name as the one to override. Here's an example of Dog overriding the eat() method inherited from Animal:




function Animal() { }
Animal.prototype.eat = function() {
  return "nom nom nom";
};

function Dog() { }
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.eat = function() {
  return "chew chew chew";
};

If you have an instance let beagle = new Dog(); and you call beagle.eat(), this is how JavaScript looks for the method on beagle’s prototype chain:
beagle => Is eat() defined here? No.


Dog => Is eat() defined here? => Yes. Execute it and stop searching.


Animal => eat() is also defined, but JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.


Object => JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.]]></summary>

It gives you a method of authenticating remote users, transferring inputs from the client to the host and relay information back to the client.
Linux and macOS users can use the terminal to SSH into their remote server directly. Windows users have to use something like Putty.
You're able to use shell commands in the same way you would if you were physically using the remote computer.
The SSH command has three pieces;

Let's admit it typing effect looks cool and the good news is we can achieve it without any pain 😜.
    npm install typed.js
    or
    yarn add typed.js
    or
    bower install typed.js

Let's dive into the code.





import Typed from "typed.js";
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";

export default function App() {
  // Create Ref element.
  const el = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const typed = new Typed(el.current, {
      strings: ["Handy", "Mandy", "Candy", "More Strings"], // Strings to display
      // Speed settings, try diffrent values untill you get good results
      startDelay: 300,
      typeSpeed: 100,
      backSpeed: 100,
      backDelay: 100
    });

    // Destropying
    return () => {
      typed.destroy();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello Developers</h1>
      {/* Element to display typing strings */}
      <span ref={el}></span>
    </div>
  );
}


Kaboom🔥🔥🔥 with just some lines of codes we achieve a lot thanks to typed.js
Custom cursor.
Loop.
Smart backspace





    ...
  useEffect(() => {
    const typed = new Typed(el.current, {
      strings: ["Handy", "Mandy", "Candy", "More Strings"], // Strings to display
      // Speed settings, try diffrent values untill you get good results
      startDelay: 300,
      typeSpeed: 100,
      backSpeed: 100,
      backDelay: 100,
      smartBackspace: true,
      loop: true,
      showCursor: true,
      cursorChar: "!"
    });

    // Destropying
    return () => {
      typed.destroy();
    };
  }, []);
    ...


For TypeScript lovers it provide types by default.

Bad: ember test (yes, it's bad even if you see it in the official docs)
Good: npm test
There are several benefits to using npm scripts instead of global commands:
No chance of local vs global package version mismatch that can lead to inexplicable errors
No chance of using the wrong command and/or options (for example, the default command for running tests in Ember projects is ember test, but a project might use ember exam and/or additional options like --load-balance --parallel=4)
No need to remember specific commands for each type of project, because npm start and npm test are standard commands used by virtually every JavaScript project, be it an Ember project, a React project, or an Express project
No need to install global packages, keep track of their versions, and update them
If you really need to run a one-off command, use npx, it will protect you from local vs global package version mismatch (because it uses local package if it detects one):

We are using the keyword var to define the variable a, the scope of a is limited to the function within which it is defined.
Since a is not defined within any function, the scope of the variable a is global, which means that a is recognized within block 2
Function Example
function fun1() {
 var a = 10;
 console.log(a);
} //function scope of fun1

It's a common mistake that every developer tends to make, especially early on: adding secrets to source-control or saving them somewhere else in plain-text. A good example of this is an API key stored in the web.config or settings.json.
Saving secrets as plain-text is a bad-practice can be a security risk. But where should you save your secrets? And how much does it cost to implement an alternative solution?
Azure Key Vault (AKV) is a service provided by Microsoft Azure that lets you store encryption keys, secrets and certificates. AKV can be easily integrated with almost any other service in Azure, but it doesn't stop there. It can easily be integrated in other environments too: local machines, apps, if you want to go crazy you can even use it in an AWS environment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Olá, hoje quero falar sobre as operações de CRUD do AdonisJS.
AdonisJS é um framework MVC completo para o NodeJS.
Para programadores PHP o AdonisJS é comparado ao Laravel, a sua sintaxe é quase semelhante, sem falar que os dois usam Template Engine.
O AdonisJS é um framework NodeJS e para isso precisamos do NodeJS instalado no nosso computador. Para ser mais especifico, precisamos do NodeJS na versão igual ou superior a 14.15.4 e precisamos também do NPM instalado na versão igual ou superior a 6.0.0.
Você pode criar um novo projecto utilizando o npm init ou yarn create. Os dois comandos vão instalar os pacotes do AdonisJS no seu computador.
Nesse caso vamos usar o NPM.
Vamos abrir o terminal e escrever:
npm init adonis-ts-app@latest crud-operations
Depois de executar o comando no terminal você pode escolher entre 3 opções a sua estrutura de projecto.
web: estrutura de projecto ideal para a criação de aplicações clássicos renderizados para servidores. Nessa selecção vai ser configurado suporte para sessões e também o template engine do AdonisJS


api: estrutura de projecto ideal para criação de um servidor API


slim: estrutura de projecto ideal para criar a menor aplicação AdonisJS possível e não instala nenhum pacote adicional, expecto o núcleo do framework.



Para o nosso projecto vamos selecionar a estrutura API.
Podes ver mais sobre instalação de um projecto AdonisJS aqui.]]></summary>

I find all the JS UI frameworks confusing. There are so many of them, each has its own syntax and structure, many components, and doesn't use "traditional" JS/TS, but many placeholders that get "replaced" later on. I reached this conclusion recently when I started a new project (with a new company) and the UI part was done purely in Angular and the UI communicated with the BE using REST calls. The project had less than a month since it started, so I wasn't quite from the start so I could not impose my view :D

We will be looking at how to make the current property immutable, mutable, and know without much effort if the ref is one or the other.
All the behavior I'm going to talk about is only relevant in the context of TypeScript. The mutability / immutability is enforced at type level, not runtime level.

The immutable semantics of the useRef hooks are usually used with DOM elements. A common use-case might be to get the ref of an element and focus that element whenever a button is clicked.
Here is how I would write that.

These functional methods have one caveat, though: You can never throw from them without aborting the whole pipeline.
someArray.map((value) => {
  if (someConditionMet) {
    throw new Error('...'); // this is not the best idea...
  }
  // ...
  return someValidValue;
});

So what do you do then? Well, you can return null to mark that you have an invalid result.
someArray.map((value) => {

    return null; // now the pipeline can continue
  }

This is a follow-on to show what the current upgrade path looks like using Angular v9.0.0-next.6 pre-beta, which contains optimizations for bundle size and performance as well as some bug fixes that were not present in v8’s preview.
As a reminder, Ivy is not ready for production. This is still a compatibility opt-in preview. Use at your own risk. Your mileage may vary.

Gradually I started thinking about my own website and came over an idea to launch a website, where I can share some technical stuff among people.
I started thinking and thinking🤔 about its architecture (Obviously I am not an architect🤪).
I got some options like ReactJS (Or NextJS), Angular, VueJS or Plain HTML-CSS-JS. Now it was totally on me, which one should I choose, obviously it was going to affect my audience and performance of website too.
I was also aware about the SEO part,🥰 obviously how could I forgot that, because that was the entrypoint of my orgaic readers.
Finally I had these options:
Angular
React (Or NextJS)
VueJS (Or NuxtJS)
Now I compared all of these and found something in Angular and React, which does not fits to my requirements.
Angular Too Hactic🤯
React Server Side Rendering was complex to achieve for a production grade application.😩
NextJS Server Side Rendering was supported, but deployment on personal server was removing some important features.😡
Now the last one
VueJS  I explored VueJS and found that there is a awesome framework on the top of Vue, NuxtJS. I explored it more and more and found these keypoints:
Server Side Rendering Support
Built on Top of VueJS
Lightweight
Can be deployed to own servers, without any performance loss
Open Source
Lot of Options For handling SEO
At this point, I had no doubts & no questions. I had decided that I will go with NuxtJS and create this awesome site.
Now its been 1 month passed, everything is running fine and smoothly with NuxtJS.
Hashcodec.com now. We are planning to launch it on 01st June 2021.
Thanks For Reading This Guys.😇
Don't forgot to visit our website Hashcodec.com

Suggestions are welcome and appreciated.]]></summary>

Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that lets you manage your Amazon EC2 instances through an interactive one-click browser-based shell or through the AWS CLI.


Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.


Session Manager also makes it easy to comply with corporate policies that require controlled access to instances, strict security practices, and fully auditable logs with instance access details, while still providing end users with simple one-click cross-platform access to your Amazon EC2 instances.

But on top of that, flex-shrink is also doing some work allowing the items to be smaller, but only if needed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is "experimental" due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.
