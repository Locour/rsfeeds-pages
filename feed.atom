I assume you have a VPS with Ubuntu 20.04 and Docker and Nginx installed.
DigitalOcean you can select the Docker image in the marketplace and add Nginx to it.
Lets create a new Rails project with PostgreSQL, esbuild and Tailwind on your local machine:
rails new demo -d postgresql --edge -j esbuild --css tailwind

Adjust you config/database.yml with the settings for your database.
Scaffold a simple table:
bin/rails g scaffold Book name:string

Then create your database and tables:
bin/rails db:create
bin/rails db:migrate

You can create a root path in routes.rb:

This time, I will try decorators.

So I just tried using them in this time.
TypeScript ver.4.4.3

webpack-cli ver.4.8.0
I think the decorators are special kinds of functions for classes and class members.
// Compile error: Decorators are not valid here
@message("Hello World")
export function funcSample() {
}

I can add decorators into classes, methods, properties, accessors, and paramters.
import { Sample } from "./sample";

function init(): void {
    const s = new Sample();
    s.userName = 'Masanori';
    s.greet('Hello!');

JavaScript - anyString.includes('') returns true might seem absurd but the behaviour matches anyString.substring(0, 0) returning '' and anyString.indexOf('') returning 0. Be careful when attempting something like providedString.includes(searchString). More on the method on MDN Web Docs.
TypeScript - JSX is the reason we can type cast using the as operator (HTMLElement as HTMLInputElement) in addition to using angle brackets (<HTMLInputElement> HTMLElement) which will be difficult to parse when mixed with JSX HTML-like syntax, as stated on TypeScript official documentation page.
AWS - Lambda functions can now run on the Arm-based Graviton2 processors by specifying arm64 as the architecture. It is said to be able to provide up to 34% price performance improvement. Details are available on the official AWS blog page.
On the week 39 of 2021, I learned that the Kindle's Vocabulary Builder feature not only automatically add words as flash cards, but also show the usage of a word in the book. Having that usage context might have encouraged me to use the feature more but I wish I could've discovered it couple of years earlier.

Every i18n module has a translate function (also can be named as short t). Assume that we have a function with such a signature:
declare function translate(path: string, variables?: Record<string, string>): string;

As the first parameter, we can pass a dot delimited keys of a translation object. It can be a JSON object or JavaScript object, whatever.

When creating a terraform configuration, you have to configure and declare Input Variables. Input variables serve as parameters for a Terraform module and resources, allowing aspects of the module to be customized without altering the module's own source code, and allowing modules to be shared between different configurations.  
The Terraform language uses the following types for its values:  
string: a sequence of Unicode characters representing some text, like "hello".
number: a numeric value. The number type can represent both whole numbers like 15 and fractional values like 6.283185.
bool: a boolean value, either true or false. bool values can be used in conditional logic.

It injects code into the file running that may create bugs where there is none


your not using VSCode


For some reason the extension isn't showing up in the menu making it less convienient



In that case, the command line to the rescure, as there are several one line commands you can run to spin up a quick webserver for basic static file serving from a particular folder. Just navigate to that particular folder in terminal and run this command and now you can see those files served in the browser.
Likely you have one of the following installed or pre-installed on your computer, just run the following commands to see what you have.
python -v do you have pythong installed and what version


php -v do you have pythong installed and what version


node -v do you have pythong installed and what version


ruby -v do you have pythong installed and what version




  
  
  Python





# If Python version returned above is 3.X
# On Windows, try "python -m http.server" or "py -3 -m http.server"
python3 -m http.server

# If Python version returned above is 2.X
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

If you have ruby installed, first install webrick gem install webrick

then this command will start a server on port 8000 ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8000




  
  
  Node




npx lite-server will start server on localhost:3000
npx http-server will start server localhost:8080
npx serve will start server on localhost:5000
php -S localhost:5000 will start a server on localhost:5000

If you have not defined any workspace then there is always a default workspace created by terraform, so you always work in a default workspace of terraform. You can list the number of terraform workspaces by running the command terraform workspace show. Also, you can not delete the default workspace

You have to either generate the SSH keys and associate the public key with the EC2 instance. After that, you need to use your private key to SSH into the virtual machine running in the AWS cloud. 
On similar lines, if you are using Terraform to provision your AWS infrastructure you need to associate the public key with your terraform script and after starting the EC2 instance you need to use your private key to SSH into the EC2 instance.

That is why terraform introduced a concept of the module that will help you to organize your terraform configuration so that you can re-use the configuration and keep your terraform code more clean and more modular.

});

_export const_ Default = BasicTemplate.bind({});
Default.args = {
  **ngContent** : "Un label",
};

The specificity here is to use a componentWrapperDecorator. It allows to wrap our component and to pass it some extras like in my case a text content.
You just have to define a template like in BasicTemplate to emulate the content projection and using it like an input.
In the Default args, I add an ngContent arg to set the content of my label. I choose this name “ngContent” because it appears in the controls list and I find it consistent to let know that’s a content projection in this way.

VIM is a text editor for writing code, where you navigate around the screen with the Keyboard instead of a Mouse.

Why would you use VIM when we have modern IDEs? The answer is, when you write code, your fingers should be bound to keyboard all the time. Every time you touch mouse your work rate is interrupted.
Linux/MacOS: VIM comes preinstalled.
Windows: Download VIM, Download the installer and install it. 
Linux/MacOS: Type "vim filename.txt" in terminal (without quotations)
Windows: Open "gVim8.1" from desktop or search in start menu.

When we develop a Single-Page Application, we usually only define its behavior in a single browser window, and even if the same application is opened on multiple browser windows, in most cases it is only synchronized with the local storage, and the state of each application in each window is not synchronized in real time (unless the server synchronizes), they run in isolation and are relatively independent.
However, this means that more browser windows will generate more and more independent application instances, which may have different UI states and often inevitably have the same network requests or WebSocket connections, which may also mean a bad user experience (as users may have become accustomed to) and excessive usage of server resources.

After passing the AWS DAS in February this year, I'd been fascinating about how to become a professional lazybones[3] in spare time apart from building custom CDK constructs, sharing at the AWS Taiwan UG, internal sharing in my own company, and recording for an external session. All of sudden, I felt gotta keep moving on towards goals after studying the quintessence of lazybones for a while. So, the journey of pursuing the AWS DevOps Engineer Professional Certification began at that moment.

In computer programming, especially functional programming and type theory, an algebraic data type is a kind of composite type, i.e., a type formed by combining other types.
If you've used TypeScript for a bit you've probably been exposed to some of these already.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not gonna talk about how does a DHCP server work exactly, 
If one of the devices in the network is configured with a static IP address, when the DHCP server starts distributing the IP addresses to other machines, what happens exactly ? does it skip it ? or does it duplicate it and therefore there would be a conflict ? 
So the answer is, NOPE the DHCP server will not distribute that IP address, you may be wondering, but how ?
Remember that the DHCP server sends an ARP Broadcast asking about the IP address about to be distributed 
"Who has x.x.x.x"
At that moment the machine with that static IP address will respond with an ARP saying that it got that IP and that its MAC address is X:X:X:X:X:X so the DHCP server will continue to the next IP address asking "Who has y.y.y.y"
But here comes another problem, 
what if the local network is placed behind a router, and we all know that the routers doesn't allow broadcasting, then what happens ?
well simply instead of ARP Broadcasting, it uses ICMP Packet type 8 code 0 which is the ECHO request ( ping ) and if it gets no answer than it distributes it, else it simply continues to the next IP address.
And here comes the last question, 
And what if a device that is configured with a static IP address was shutdown, and the DHCP distributed its IP address, what happens if the machine is up again?
well there are two solutions for this, some DHCP servers are advanced enough and caches the static IP address and therefore this conflict will never occurs, but if the DHCP server doesn't provide this feature, than it should be configured to exclude these IP addresses or else there will be an IP Duplication.
And this pretty much sums up the main problems of dealing with a DHCP server.]]></summary>

DNS/IP of the cluster
Authentication Credentials
which will found in kubeconfig.
I'm setting up in windows. So, will be using below reference.
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/
Download this Kubectl binary

Next Step, Move that Binary to C:\Binaries. If Binaries folder is not there, create one.

Create a Environment Variable to call this Binary.

Move the kubeconfig file to C:\Users\ .kube and name it as config ( removing .yml extension)

To Verify, run kubectl , it will work from any path.

Recently while I was working on one of my projects, I encountered a relatively common problem. I wanted to scroll to a component when its loaded on screen or on some other event. If you have worked with pure js, then there is a very simple solution using scrollIntoView function.
const elmnt = document.getElementById("content");
elmnt.scrollIntoView();

Run the above code on that particular event and it works like a charm.
Now when I searched for a solution in React, I came across this library react-scroll. Its a react library for animating vertical scrolling that provides functionality to scroll to a component on an event. Its good but I didn't want to add another dependency a…]]></summary>

Hey, often we make console.log(...) to see the value of a parameter or a result method.
Here I present you a decorator which allow to do it easily. It’s purpose is for debugging when you are developing something.
Now that’s how to use it:
class Toto {
  @Log()
  public myMethod(...args: unknown[]): boolean { ... }

  @Log({ outputs: false })
  public myMethod2(...args: unknown[]): void { ... }

  @Log({ inputs: false })
  public myMethod3(...args: unknown[]): unknown { ... }

  @Log({ type: 'trace' })
  public myMethod4(...args: unknown[]): unknown { ... }

  @Log({ type: 'trace', inputs: false, outputs: false })
  public myMethod5(...args: unknown[]): unknown { ... }

}

TypeScript is a superset of Javascript, invented by Microsoft, that adds strong type checking. Hence, the 'type' in TypeScript, I guess. The TS code is taken into a compiler and then translated into JS code, meaning all of the features of JS are available to us, plus the added features of TS. 
Some added features are:

Karena menurut data statistik, 1 juta website terpopuler pake Linux buat OS Server-nya.
Lalu, kita ngga bisa denial kalo OS pilihan dari kebanyakan hacker itu ya Linux..
Ini karena hacker-hacker tuh suka otak-atik semaunya sendiri dan karena Linux itu open-source, Linux bisa di-customize buat nyesuaiin kebutuhan mereka.
Dan juga, unethical dan bad hackers biasanya pake tools yang mereka bikin sendiri atau yang sudah tersedia di Linux untuk nge-hack ke dalam jaringan dan aplikasi yang lemah dan rentan keamanannya.
Banyak Distro Linux yang sudah terinstall tools buat hacking yang siap pake.
Tapi jika tools tersebut belum ada, maka tinggal diinstall dong wkwk.
Diantara Distro Linux buat hacking yang umum dipake adalah:
Kali Linux, yang berbasis dari varian Debian.
BackBox, yang berbasis dari varian Ubuntu.
Parrot Security OS, yang berbasis dari varian Debian.
CAINE, yang berarti Computer Aided INvestigative Environment yang biasanya dipake buat Digital Forensic dan
Samurai Web Testing Framework untuk pentest (penetration testing) aplikasi web (web application).
Jadi jika kalian mau berkarir di Tim Operations (seperti DevOps dan SRE) maupun belajar hacking sebagai hobi, atau untuk menjadi ethical hacker, kalian wajib belajar dan jago di Linux xD.]]></summary>

now let's remove all the node_modules directories from all the projects. make sure that you're inside a directory where you're comfortable removing all the node_modules cause this action is irereversable:
LINUX
$ cd Dev
$ find . -name "node_modules" -type d -prune -exec rm -rf '{}' +

WINDOW
$ cd Dev 
$ FOR /d /r . %d in (node_modules) DO @IF EXIST "%d" rm -rf "%d"

a single node_modules took about 400MB - 90MB in my cases and total space it took around 10gigabyte - 15gigabyte. it will help you to free up some space in your machine if you have limited SSD, but if you've removed from all the directories, you have to install it again for the project you're working on, keep this in mind.
I hope you enjoyed this article and learnt something valuable, thank you all and stay blessed!

In this blog, we are mainly focusing on how to read email attachments based on the DATE RANGE, FROM particular email address and it's SUBJECT.
Let's see from the below example code which fetches first 3 email messages from the mail box.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a “preflight” request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.

The solution to bypass CORS is to use a Proxy. A Proxy server, that forwards your request as it is.
But, problems with a Proxy Server is to manage the server, optimize the server, handle traffic, use of Kubernetes to minimize bills, and what n…]]></summary>

The tool supports keygen, file sign and verify ops, as such it is complete and ready for common file signature use cases. Imagine - now you can sign your Github Releases with (probably) post-quantum safe signatures and chill (4ever)...

Using .env files to manage application config and secrets is a step forward from hard-coding secrets, but there are also security risks and issues relating to the synchronization and manual management of .env files across different environments. This tutorial introduces Doppler, a solution to secret management and synchronization.
In this article, we have a Django application that has its secrets defined in a .env file. We will look at how we can move those secrets from the traditional .env file to Doppler.
Managing secrets and configs in Doppler keeps them in sync across different environments. You only have to define your secrets once and Doppler acts as a central source of truth for your secrets, saving you the stress of having to re-define them in every environment or share t…]]></summary>

If you’re planning to build a native Android app that requires users to log in, you should use Auth0. 
Implementing user login/logout often turns into its own project. Just implementing the many ways users want to log in can easily take a lot of time. You’d also have to deal with issues such as user management, scaling, and security, each of which could have its own article.
With Auth0 and a few lines of code, your app can have a full-featured system that supports logging in with a basic username/password combination, single sign-on and social accounts, passwordless login, biometrics, and more. You won’t have to handle the “behind the scenes” issues, either!

Code review is a part of regular development practices for any corporation. However, adding security elements to the code review is the most effective measure in preventing vulnerabilities, even before the first commit. Additionally, the code review process provides itself with sharing security best practices amongst a development team. Finally, it produces 'lessons' that we can learn to prevent future bugs.
The primary purpose of security engineers is to work collaboratively with the rest of the team to figure out a way not to reproduce the same vulnerabilities or at least implement a mechanism to minimize them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to preface all of this by saying I'm a pretty new developer. If there's any clarification needed because my question is not preicse enough I'll gladly provide!
So as part of my current education we're doing something they call pop-up internship where you go to visit a company for a day or two and run through a couple different departments to get a feel for how different companies might tackle some of the daily tasks they encounter.
One company in particular had an app in development that really got me interested. They were building a web application for one of their customers based on the Angular framework from what I understand. The backend/serverside code was written in Java. The interesting part is that they used some way to turn the expoted Java-WAR into a file they would include in the Angular project. This allowed them to call methods from that service and, what was the most interesting to me, the classes for the project were only defined in that Java code yet perfectly usable in that Angular code. I saw some kind of service URL in the code which I assume is somehow being used to make the actual calls in some way.
Unfortunately I wasn't able to dig deep enough/get into the deeper questions I had regarding the whole procedure. 
I don't have any experience with Java, writing mostly little PHP and C# applications so far so I wondered - is a model like this possible to set up with Angular and PHP? If yes, where do I need to look in terms of guidance to set something like that up with my Angular project? What are some key things I need to know before tackling something like this? Is it even worth doing like that?
There's a lot floating in my head right now regarding this because this is kinda exciting to me, any and all help would be greatly appreciated]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post I'm going to explain you how to code playfair cipher to encrypt plaintext to cipher. So this post is all about encryption program and will soon add decryption program in this series also so stay tuned!
If you don't know how the algorithm works checkout previous post in this series.
So Without further ado, LET'S BEGIN!!👨‍💻👩‍💻
Yes, You're right! 
three steps:
Convert plaintext into digraphs (i.e., into pair of two letters)
Generate a Cipher Key Matrix
Encrypt plaintext using Cipher Key Matrix and get ciphertext.
 

  
  
  Programming Playfair Cipher:


  
  
  Step: 1 Creating function to convert plaintext into digraphs




  



 
 


  
  
  Now we need to locate index of particular character inside cipher key matrix to perform encryption:




  



 
 


  
  
  Final Step! Running our code from main method:

I hope the code with comments was actually sufficient to understand the logic.
Here's the repository link to the whole code file GitHub Repo
But if you still have any doubts feel free to mention below in discussion section, I would love to answer them.
