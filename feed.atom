And one day you want to comment something in JSX, and your first try would be to do:
function Component() {
  return (

      <!-- This is my comment -->
      The quick brown fox ...

  )
}

And for sure your bundler started complaining, that your syntax is invalid, and then you search the internet, and realise that a HTML Comment is not valid in JSX, and you learn that you have to use a JavaScript comment.
Well in this blog post I will show you for learning purposes how to trick React to render a real HTML Comment in your browser in a few steps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, so its not actually called "specific Array combination types", but that was the best description I had for it, before I looked it up.
https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/typescript/typescript-tuple
I'll come back to why this blew my mind today, but first, lets scroll back a bit, to some of my first steps into JS/TS programming. I started my programming career in Java, and one of the things that annoyed the hell out of me, was the fact that I could only have 1 object returned from a function (This was before the Pair class was introduced).
But in JS we can easily just return an array with 2 values:
const someFunction = () => {
    return ['Mathias', 28];
}

And combined with some destructuring on the recieving, it was all nice and easy:
const [myName, myAge] = someFunction();

Until today I never had to add types onto a scenario like this, usually when I work with arrays, I either just do a basic string[], or when its required in complex object scenarios: Array<{name: string, age: number}>.
[string, number]:
const someFunction = (): [string, number] => {
    return ['Mathias', 28];
}

I came across this when I working with Vue2 combined with TS, and was trying to create a v-for loop over a Map, but Vue2 did not support this, so I had to come up with a different approach that supported the same end goal.
So this is where the new tuples came in handy! Given an example with some data in a Map:
const map = new Map<string, object>();
map.set('key1', {data: 'lots of data'});
map.set('key2', {data: 'more data'});

I could then destructure it into an array like so:
const asArray = ...map.entries();
// Yielding:
[
    ['key1', {data: 'lots of data'}],
    ['key2', {data: 'more data'}],
]

And in order to Type this we now have:
const asArray: Array<[string, object]> = ...map.entries();

Thank you for reading this far, hope you gained something from this post.]]></summary>

Semantic versioning was introduced as a solution to the problem by standardizing how versions are assigned and incremented. Consider a version format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch).

Traditional HTTP, being dependent on client requests, is simply not capable of fulfilling this need. They're simply too slow. It needs to be upgraded, literally.
Let me introduce you to Websockets - An event-driven, web-friendly alternative to HTTP. Websockets don't require a client request to fetch data from the server every time, fulfilling the need for real-time updates. Wondering how? Let's find it out.
In simple terms, websockets are an upgrade to traditional HTTP.
Whenever a websocket request is made to regular HTTP, it is actually upgraded to a websocket connection. However, this happens only at the protocol lev…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In JavaScript, short-circuiting refers to the partial evaluation of expressions to avoid unnecessary computation. This blog post describes the short-circuiting operators and assignments in JavaScript and how to use them.
Short-circuiting operators only evaluate the right side of an expression when necessary. 
For example, for the logical AND operator &&, when the left side of the operator is false, the right side of the operator will not change the result. The result is false regardless of whether the right side is true or false. Therefore JavaScript skips the evaluation of the right side and uses the value from the left side.
There are three short-circuiting binary operators in JavaScript:
Logical AND (A && B): B is only evaluated if A is truthy.
Logical OR (A || B): B is only evaluated i…]]></summary>

Node Package Manager (npm), which is indispensable for developing systems with JavaScript and TypeScript, often has a problem with its large library size.

Of course, there have been a lot of discussions about node module's issue, and I don't want to say anything about it now.
I'm sure there are many ways to solve the above problem, but for webdev developers like me, the only thing we can do is to delete libraries that we don't use, so let's think of ways delete unuse libraries.
depcheck is a tool to check how each library dependency is used, which dependencies are not used, and which dependencies are missing from package.json for your projects packaged with npm.
Using npx in the project root,

The acceleration of digital transformation, which was exacerbated by the Covid pandemic, has stimulated the development of new technologies, consequently increasing the value of companies’ intellectual property.

I realized that when you finished a course and learn some stuff and then work on actual projects, you seldom go back to the course and re-watch particular sections related to the issue you're troubleshooting.
Instead, you either a) go to your own notes or documentation to see if you've resolved it before (if you trust your documentation well enough), or you take the much easier and quicker route, b) you google it or search for sample use-cases in Youtube.
So, I think structured courses are really great when you're at the stage of discovery. But when you are trying to implement it to solve your own problems, you follow your own instinct to google it and hope someone has raised the same specific issues in Stackoverflow or hope that someon…]]></summary>

I am in an old system which installed Ubuntu 18.04, it has specifc security rules that does not allow user to talk to outside network, and I had issue using old version docker-compose which got installed by sudo apt install docker-compose. But I really need the latest docker-compose from github so that can support my latest docker-compose.yml definitions.
My favourite way when there is network access to github.com is always as described in this article.
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

docker-compose --version

But how about no network?
Luckily that old Ubuntu 18.04 system, I can manage to upload docker-compose file I downloaded from other machine and then I did
sudo cp docker-compose /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

docker-compose --version

you thought it will work, right? 
But you got this error message:
docker-compose: error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1: failed to map segment from shared object

Soluton is do the following command, see some explain here - "resolved by re-mounting the /tmp to give the volume permission to execute, it was accessible with read-only"
sudo mount /tmp -o remount,exec

Now you will have the latest docker-compose on your old Ubuntu 18.04.]]></summary>

This solution uses the following AWS services:
AWS CodeCommit – Source Control
AWS CodeBuild – Build System

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For as long as I can remember the recommended way to generate unique universal Identifiers in node.js was to the uuid module. These IDs are useful in all sorts of scenarios including for database keys, filenames, URLs, etc. Recently both node.js and the browser began offering nearly identical APIs that will generate 36-character version 4 uuids without any dependencies.
Available in Chrome since July 2021 and coming soon other browsers is crypto.randomUUID(). There's a global crypto object that's available on the global self property. You can use that to generate a UUID like this:
self.crypto.randomUUID();

The UUID it generates is a v4 UUID per the spec and ends up with a string that looks something like this:
"0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d"


You want to do the same thing in node? Instead of reaching for the uuid package. As long as you're on version 14.17 or newer, you can do this:
const { randomUUID } = require("crypto");
randomUUID(); // "0aa9d4f3-efdb-4a06-806c-5f8fa5f1767d"

It's cool see node and the browser adopting powerful APIs for crypto and improved randomness. I'll definitely be reaching for these in the near future!
You can read more in the WebCrypto section in the MDN or the crypto section in the node.js docs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disclaimer: This is my first time using Vim (actually Neovim 😎), so by no means am I an expert.
This article was really helpful while configuring Neovim on my machine.
Vim is basically a text editor for Unix. It's similar to other programs like Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text Editor or Atom.
So what led me to Vim


I love new challenges and improving my productivity. VS code was pretty customized and suitable for my current needs. Maybe YouTube videos from this guy (DistroTube) was the motivation to try it out. 
Efficiency: Vim is designed to reduce how often switch from your keyboard to a mouse. They are literally keybinding for any type of operation and you can create custom keybindings too. If you type really fast, this will improve your productivity as you will really need your mouse.
Learning Curve: Vim has quite a learning curve if you're just starting. For the first few days, my focus was shifted majorly from the code I write to the tool I use. This is going to pay off later by building up muscle memory you will be able to exit Vim in your sleep.
A quick meme about exiting vim:

Conclusion


I will continue sharing my learning experience and journey with Vim for the next few months
Whatever editor, language or framework you use, they should be able to solve your problems effectively and efficiently. 
Neovim and it's simpler and maintained. 
Do you think it is worth the time to learn Vim?]]></summary>

Indeed, not really amateurs in terms of know-how to develop software in a secure way.
Well despite this, this researcher has managed to go through all the defenses of his companies simply by going through the development libraries that all developers use so as not to have to constantly reinvent the wheel.
By injecting malware into these libraries, he only had to wait for an update within these companies to be deployed without doing anything.
We talk about it in this video and I explain how to avoid falling into the trap yourself.
And you, have you ever thought about this kind of attack method on your software?

This was also all written at time of the announcement of Public Preview, so things are liable to change ahead of General Availability.
Amazon Linux has traditionally been built around CentOS. With the transition from its standard release cycle to CentOS Stream, Amazon has decided transition to using Fedora as the base for Amazon Linux 2022, with the kernel from the Linux LTS versions.

Personal opinion: CentOS Stream is a bad choice for production use, and Amazon made a good decision to not try and shoe-horn it into Amazon Linux. Fedora also makes sense since it was alr…]]></summary>

What is difference between Ubuntu and Linux?
Linux


Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldn't function.
Kernel – This is the one piece of the whole that is actually called Linux. The kernel is the core of the system and manages the CPU, memory, and peripheral device…]]></summary>

Not too long ago, as an engineer, you had to understand how to install Linux. You needed to know how to dedicate storage to the OS, mount volumes, install the operating system itself, and configure the operating system.
Now, things are slightly different ever since we started living in a cloudy world. Getting a system up and running is as easy as logging into a cloud portal and clicking a few buttons. 
The problem with not knowing about operating systems is; regardless how much abstraction there is, systems are still needed. For example, a Docker container is running a flavor of Linux or a version of Windows. You…]]></summary>

Today I am mentioning a topic why is neccessary when owning your own small business, or protecting your by using installing surveillance cameras. 
The cameras which you install to protect your possession do mostly offer no more than a video source, which is persisted on any type of hard drive (in marketing they would say "secure data server") inside of your shop or home and will only be inspected if something happened. 
Some more modern surveillance technologies do also offer motion detection.
Thus the motion detection may somehow be used to update the cameras orientation, as often seen in Action Movies. The camera may follow the motion by a certain degree thus the original field of view is still in sight but the motion can be captured too.

And then, in your .html file, simply set the color input attribute to green as below:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For application access, you should not use the managed AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for Amazon DynamoDB. These IAM policies are designed for use with the AWS Web Console and therefore have more permissions to more services than most applications need access to. Instead, please create your own IAM policies for DynamoDB.
In order to follow least privilege security conventions, it is best practice to create your own custom IAM policy for DynamoDB access by an application. If this is something you have never done before, don't be intimidated. I got ya. To get you started, here are a few templates I created to use to enable full access to only Amazon DynamoDB table resources. 
Once you play with these templates, you should ultimately create a new policy that narrows access down to just the operations the app needs to do on the resources it needs to do it. If all you are doing is SELECT and INSERT with the PartiQL API for DynamoDB on one table, then the only actions you should allow are these two:
"dynamodb:PartiQLInsert"
"dynamodb:PartiQLSelect"
In summary, use security best practices when designing access to Amazon DynamoDB for your apps, create your own customer managed IAM policies and do not use the AWS managed IAM policies.]]></summary>

With the Angular CLI no longer including a complete out-of-the-box development solution, it is more important than ever to understand the tools at our disposal to improve the developer experience when building Angular applications.
Modern Angular Tooling is the term used to describe modern tools that will enable you and your team to build a comprehensive development environment. This development environment takes advantage of the latest improvements in the JavaScript ecosystem to improve productivity, consistency, reliability, scalability and developer experience when building Angular applications and libraries.

In this article, I will show you three different ways of installing Nodejs in linux. You can feel comfortable following the same process in any ubuntu-baseds distro you use.
Installation of Nodejs is insanely easy with apt package manager in linux. To install nodejs with apt package manager, just open up your terminal. Copy this command sudo apt update  && sudo apt upgrade and paste here, hit enter, and type your password. Then we use the command sudo apt install nodejs, press enter, wait few seconds and you find your nodejs is successfully installed. To check the version just type the command node —version and you get the version.

Many applications leave themselves exposed because they transmit critical data such as product prices and discount rates via the client in an unsafe manner.
If possible, applications should avoid transmitting this kind of data via the client. In virtually any conceivable scenario, it is possible to hold such data on the server and reference it directly from server-side logic when needed. 
For example, an application that receives users’ orders for various products should allow users to submit a product code and quantity and look up the price of each requested product in a server-side database. There is no need for users to submit the prices of items back to the server. Even where an application offers different prices or discounts to different users, ther…]]></summary>

1. Better Performance
React is mostly like a library than just a framework. Therefore, one does not has to work upfront with DOM or Data Object Model. Instead of that, it goes for a Virtual DOM layer. It updates only those parts of the actual DOM which is needed to update. This escalates the development speed in React instead of Angular. 
Moreover, the Virtual DOM is one of the best features to have as it resolves the issues associated with cross-browser.
The developers also get access to a unified API of cross-browser that runs even on old browser versions. Such excellent performance of React has made everyone not hire AngularJS developers and opt for ReactJS developers as it is becoming more and more popular than Angular.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Angular comes with many built-in directives. Some of them (eg. NgIf, NgModel or FormControlDirective) are used daily by Angular developers. Those directives can be split into 2 categories:
Attribute directives
They can be used to modify the appearance of behavior of Angular components and DOM elements. For example:
RouterLink
NgModel
FormControlDirective
Structural directives
They can be used to manipulate the HTML structure in the DOM. Using them, we can change the structure of part of the DOM that they control. For example:
NgIf
NgForOf
NgSwitch
In this article, I will focus on the latter.
As I've mentioned above, there are a couple of built-in structural directives in Angular. However, we might come across a case that the ones provided with the framework don't solve. This…]]></summary>
