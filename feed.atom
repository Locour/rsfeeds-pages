        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any starter node.js enthusiastic would at least one time ponder, how can a single thread system out perform better than a MultiThreaded system.
And specially many people from multithreaded pardigm, who are evaluating/understading node.js,  would rather find it hard to understand : why Node.js(or any single threaded non blocking JS system) is acclaimed better than multi-threaded system (At least for serving web-traffic!)?
Node.JS is not faster (doesnot means its slower either), but rather highly efficient in handling a single thread, as compared to a blocking multi-threaded system handling its single thread!
I have made diagrams to explain this statement with analogies.


A multi-threaded blocking system is not capable of utilizing its threads power to its full potential, as a thread is blocked until it evaluates each line of code.
Now offcourse one can build a non blockig system on top of a blocking multi-threaded system (thats what Node.js is under the hood), but its very complex. And you have to do it ever where you need non blocking code in your application or program.
Javascript ecosystem (like nodejs) provide this out of the box as its syntax. The JS language sytanx provide all this feature where ever needed. Morever as its part of its syntax, the reader of the code immeditetly knows that where code is blocking and where its non-blocking.
The blocking part of multithreaded-blocking system makes it less efficient. The thread which is blocked cannot be used for anything else, while its waiting for response.
While a non-blocking single threaded system makes best use of its single thread system.
And hence node.js if used properly can out perform many multi-threaded systems.]]></summary>

The destroyAfterEach Angular testing module teardown option addresses several long-time issues when using the Angular testbed:

Component styles are never removed from the DOM

Feature-level services using the any provider scope are never destroyed
Angular modules are never destroyed

Here is a Portuguese version.
In my ongoing project, I have a CI/CD flow and one step is responsible to collect the code coverage and validate if I have the minimal value to proceed to another step.
However, even having 84% of code coverage, the SonarQube always returned 30% of the result in the step, because of that the deployment step was never executed. 
I spent some time understanding that the problem was in the Lombok annotations, the SonarQube was computing the generated code.
It's simple to resolve this issue. I created a file named lombok.config inside the folder java (/../src/main/java/lombok.config) with this:
config.stopBubbling = true
lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true

The config.stopBubbling informs the Lombok that the folder where the file is the root and the Lombok don't need to search for more parent folders.
While lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation  put in every generated code by Lombok annotation, another one named @lombok.Generated. This annotation informs Jacoco to not collect coverage from those codes.
Done, problem solved!

Docker is lovely developer tool that makes it easy to install and run software without worrying about setup and dependencies.
This is because it makes containers, imagine a multi layer cake where you take a verticle slice of it, so you take from each layer a portion but you don't care about the rest of the slices. Here is an illustration for it.

Which makes it easy for microservices, one example that we will be seeing soon is deploying multiple services with different environemnts or maybe different versions of the very same dependency, like different nodejs versions.

I'm going to build the initial framework of a shortened URL service.  I already have the shortened URL portion working for in-house purposes, but I'll be enhancing that and creating a more commercial version so I can start marketing it as a SaaS.
I'll be coding in PHP, JavaScript, SQL and using the Wizards Toolkit which is a low-code development environment.
While coding I discuss the business aspects of creating a SaaS and marketing basics.  How to pick a niche and choose what to do to be Different and Better when in an oversaturated market. 
First step was reviewing the competition... and there is a lot of competition in this market.

A very clever malware designed with 3 components: - trojanized applications, - backdoors, and - rootkits. 🐞
It employs a rootkit to conceal its presence and uses different command and control servers for each sample, maintaining a low profile on your system as if nothing is happening will it cause havoc.
It is designed to launch and mediate access to a local SSH server, update itself, and transmit collected credentials. 🔒
FontOnLake is capable of file manipulation, updating itself, and uploading and downloading files
It accepts remote connections, serves as a proxy and can download and run Python scripts, in addition to exfiltrating credentials.
Surprisingly, this malware targets the one who is immune to most viruses, Linux
And the most scary part is that, it is still under development (and it is this deadly ☠️)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you think this is a good usage of map in terms on readability / performance?
Lets say I'm making a list of notes but only allow 1 per day, You have a list of your notes:
[
{id: 1, date: "2021-10-12", content: "hello world!"}, 
{id: 2, date: "2021-10-13", content: "hope you have a great day!"}
]

We have a text field and a submit button, on click we call upsertNote() which will update the array if it's the same day or will add a new record i.e:
usertNote({date: "2021-10-13", content: "how you get through today!"})
// output:
{id: 2, date: "2021-10-13", content: "how you get through today!"}

usertNote({date: "2021-10-14", content: "Future me!"})
// output:
{id: 3, date: "2021-10-14", content: "future me!"}

Notice how one updates the existing entry and the other creates a new one. 
Now lets say we want to add to our existing list. We could do a search on the array for the id but what if we used a Map instead? 
Is that better in terms on readability and performace?
e.g.
const toDoList = new Map(originalArray.map((i) => [i.id, i]))
const upsertToDoEntry = usertNote({date: "2021-10-14", content: "Future me!"})

toDoList.set(upsertToDoEntry.id, upsertToDoEntry)

// In our react if we wanted to map these out we'd have to do something like this:
Array.from(toDoList , ([id, toDoEntry]) => (
<span key={id}>{toDoEntry.content}</span>
)

Would you implement it this way? :)]]></summary>

We’ve all been in situations where we used a library that had been typed sparingly. Take the following third-party function, for example:
function describePerson(person: {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  hobbies: [string, string]; // tuple
}) {
  return `${person.name} is ${person.age} years old and love ${person.hobbies.join(" and  ")}.`;
}

If the library doesn’t provide a standalone type for the person argument of describePerson, defining a variable beforehand as the person argument would not be inferred correctly by TypeScript.
const alex = {
  name: 'Alex',
  age: 20,
  hobbies: ['walking', 'cooking'] // type string[] != [string, string]
}

Angular apps consist of various components written with TypeScript or JavaScript. These are decorated with directives for handling things such as binding the HTML or markup to data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When a method [on a child class] is marked with override, TypeScript will always make sure that a method with the same name exists in a the base class.
Typescript Handbook
The override keyword has been a long running feature of languages such as Java and C++, and since version 4.3, is now implemented in Typescript! 🎉
As the top quote explains, the override keyword will assert that the function it describes is present in the parent class. This will help cut down on typos, and can give you a heads up if you were not aware that a function was changed/removed in the parent class.
abstract class Animal {
  public sleep() {
    // some default logic
  }

  public eat() {
    // some default logic
  }
}

class Unicorn extends Animal {
  public override sleep() {
    // some new logic
  }

  // Error! The method `eats` does not
  // exist in the parent class!
  public override eats() {
    // some new logic
  }
}

This is an example of implementing the wrong function due to a typo, and Typescript catching it for you before runtime!
If you'd like to make marking overridden methods with override required, you can enable the noImplicitOverride options in your tsconfig.json.
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "noImplicitOverride": true
  }
}

Now, Typescript will throw an error if an overridden method does not include the override keyword.
I hope you learned a bit about the override keyword! If you have any questions, corrections, or addons, I would love to hear them. Peace ✌]]></summary>

Before we migrated our backend to GraphQL, one trade-off that we encountered was the additional complexity that it imposed on our client-side networking code - especially when we had to create views that used data from multiple services.
For example, our application had a "appointment list" view that looked a little something like this:

There, you are going to find instructions on how to build it and how to run it locally.
The frontend is written in Angular and the backend in Quarkus. The database is PostgreSQL. They are deployed as containers on Heroku and the HTTP communication is protected by JWT tokens.
I describe the technique used to deploy them as containers on Heroku in this article on medium.
You can access this demo version running on Heroku and try it right now. But as this is only a demo, please don't use a real password there!
The application get dormant after some time without use, so the first access can take some extra time.

Shopping List is a web application that was created especially for mobile devices.
You'll be able to organize the products you want to buy and do your shopping more quickly.
Once you create one account, you can create shopping lists and add products to them.
When you're buying products at the market, you can check the products updating your list and switch from one shopping list to other very easily.
You can, for instance, create one shopping list for fruits, other for cleaning products and another for grocery. So, in the top menu, you will be able to switch between these shopping lists while you're checking the products you already bought.

Application
API swagger
I used Angular Material and Angular Flex-Layout in this project.
On the Quarkus project I used Hibernate Panache to control the database and SmallRye JWT to protect the endpoints.
Perhaps you can find it interesting the Swagger-UI, created automatically by the SmallRye OpenAPI, that has the possibility of doing one Authentication to test the endpoints protected by JWT.

Let’s first generate a simple React project by using create-react-app. Execute the following command:
npx create-react-app hep-demo --template typescript && cd hep-demo

Start the app and see if everything is working properly:
yarn start

If you encounter a issue with "babel-jest": "^26.6.0" add a .env file with SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true (echo 'SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true' > .env )
Now that our app is working we can start by adding the needed packages. 
To install the packages, execute the following command:
yarn add @spotify/prettier-config @typescript-eslint/parser husky lint-staged prettier -D

We will use the eslint config of airbnb to do that execute the following command:

And the truth is, it is easier than it seems.
A decorator is nothing more than a "typical" Javascript/Typescript function what to add additional functionalities to a declaration. When we say declaration, we mean classes, methods, parameters, accessor (getter) and properties. Now, we are going to explain each one of them.

  Generic CRUD Model


Once we have walked about the theory of generics (Part 1) and we have understand the main CRUD methods (Part 2), now it's time to see it in action.
Before start to implement the generic service of CRUD. We must define the generic model of all resources.
In this article, we assume that all models have some common properties like id, createdAt, and updatedAt.
Thus, we create a generic abstract class that contains all these common properties.

Even though it's not that often we see heatmaps in tables, but heatmaps can really add some value in terms of visualization. It would make sense in data sets where there is some kind of comparison or range.

If you have this question in mind, here are some reasons which justify why creating a directive for implementing this feature will make sense.

Bu sorunu çözebilmek için öncelikle dbus adlı servisin çalıştığından emin olunmalıdır.
systemctl status dbus

Eğer bu komut sonrası dönüt aşağıdaki gibi ise servisin bulunmadığını söylemektedir.

Bu durumda aşağıdaki komut ile servis yüklenir:
apt install dbus

Sonrasında servis otomatik olarak active hale gelmiş olabilir. Yine de kesinlik kazandırmak için servisi başlatmalı ve "enable" hale getirmeliyiz. Böylelikle makine her başladığında çalışır duruma gelebilmektedir.
systemctl start dbus
systemctl enable dbus

Eğer "systemctl status dbus" komutunun dönütü aşağıdaki gibi ise servis bulunmakta fakat aktif olmadığı anlamına gelmektedir.

Servis aktif edilir:
systemctl start dbus

Böylelikle dbus servisi sorunu çözümlenmiş olur. Eğer bu işlemlere rağmen çözüm sağlanılmamış ise bunun sebebi /var/run ile /run arasındaki gerekli symbolic linkin bozulmuş olması olabilir. Bunun için aşağıdaki komutlar çalıştırılır ve servisin durumuna bakılır:
sudo rm /var/run -R
sudo ln -s /run /var
sudo reboot]]></summary>

Setting up codecs is the crucial part of encoding media assets. You will usually want to either keep source file’s encoding or apply a new encoder.
There are so many available codecs that ffmpeg supports. Below examples are some of the most popular combos that have been used in a number of different commercial projects.

I've been a part of a number of different Angular front end projects in the past years. In every one of those projects, there came a point in time where we were asked to implement:
When a call to the backend fails due to authentication errors (401), route the user to the login page.
It didn't take long until another use case arrived:
When a call to the backend fails, alert the user of the failure with a generic "The requested operation failed".
Soon after, another use case:
When the user tries to get the information of an existing contact, and the operation fails, display a toast "Contact not found".
This would escalate further when the same operation failure would need a different error handling when done from different components.

After some searching I found two articles (links at the bottom) which describes the "sequence" which Unix follows when reading files. As summary, here's the files (in order):
/etc/profile
~/.bash_profile
~/.bash_login
4 ~/.profile
I added the function for .bashrc at the top of the .bash_profile:
## Loads .bashrc
if [[ -f ~/.bashrc ]] ; then
        . ~/.bashrc
fi

Closed terminal and reopened it 

Adding this great explanation from the reference link:
By default, Terminal starts the shell via /usr/bin/login, which makes the shell a login shell. On every platform (not just Mac OS X) bash does not use .bashrc for login shells (only /etc/profile and the first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile that exists and is readable). This is why "put source ~/.bashrc in your .bash_profile" is standard advice
Why doesn't .bashrc run automatically?
How do I set up my shell execution PATH?

What is the difference between .bash_profile and .bashrc?]]></summary>

The first thing to discuss is buffered writes. Any write to a linux local filesystem is done 'buffered', unless explicitly defined it not to, which is done by opening the file with the O_DIRECT flag. So all file interactions from the shell likely are done buffered, and the Postgresql database is also using buffered IO.
What happens when you perform a buffered write is that you don't actually write to the disk, but instead you write to memory. Because currently the latency of most disk IO/writes is still much higher than memory IO latency (~ 25us/modern SSD vs 160ns/memory, although very configuration specifi…]]></summary>

For example, in this tutorial we will learn how to get country-code and number as separate entities from the same form-control, and we will also create custom input for the same to handle the conversion between UI and value.

We use it in Angular all the time, from simple reactions to HTTP client responses to full-blown state management solutions. But sometimes, it is easy to miss some details and create a code that can break at the worst possible moment. 
Let’s start with an example right away.
of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  .pipe(
    tap(v => {
      if (v === 3) {
        throw new Error('some error');

  )
  .subscribe({
    next: console.log.bind(null, 'next:'),
    error: (err: Error) => console.log('error:', err.message),
  });

We have an observable that emits numbers from 1 to 5, and if the number is 3, we throw an error.
We can see the following output.
next: 1
next: 2
error: some error

Numbers 4 and 5 were not processed at all.

Praticamente todos os navegadores mantêm um cache da aplicação no computador do cliente para conseguir carregar a aplicação de forma mais rápida e com menor consumo de dados e isso é excelente. Entretanto, um efeito colateral é que as atualizações podem demorar para serem entregues para o cliente. Como consequência, o cliente pode ficar horas ou dias com uma versão com um bug que já foi corrigido.
Em sistemas internos de empresas, isso pode resultar em ligações ou tickets constantes para a equipe de suporte técnico, causando uma sobrecarga na equipe. Quando estamos falando de aplicações fornecidas para clientes externos à empresa, pode ser um ponto de frustração e insatisfação com o produto.
