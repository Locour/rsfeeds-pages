Logging is the process of recording application actions, activities and state to a secondary interface.


Logging is the process of recording application activities into log files. Data saved in a log file are called logs and are usually identified with the .log extension (some people use other extension preferences)



In this article, you will discover how to use - Winston to log your application activities into files instead of logging to the console.
Why do we need to Log application activities you may ask;
Helps us know when something or an issue occurs with our app, especially when it's in production mode.
Helps monitor and Keep track of your system activities.
Helps persist data so you can view this data for analysis later

Opentelemetry's sentry exporter is pretty cool, even thought it's specifically for traces right now, it does its job well.
The sidecar architecture for opentelemetry-collector will work the best for a scenario. The engineers thought out the agent, collector interface pretty good. 
The Traces specification and the TraceID stuff is good too, I just hope there was more sync between the published package and the github repository.
Need to show the instrumentation demo to the lead.
Probably will need to checkout Elastic APM exporters for these traces.
See if sentry can support any logging :)
Checking how opentelemetry trace back the traces by the ID.
WTF is going on with those spans? Why do they provide us with new contexts?
Thanks for listening to the rant.

Personally, I really love TypeScript and the Redux/Reducer patterns, because they give me a great Developer Experience with TypeScript and a lot of autocompletion available, quite useful in order to not get bit by a bug caused by a typo, and really convenient as I don't have to explore files constantly in order to know what are the properties that a certain object should have.
I always prefer to use TS over vanilla JS, so, it makes a lot of sense to try to make use of strict typing, even in a concept app. Also, while vanilla useReducer might not be what most projects use, I still want to share how I found it to be pretty useful in this context.

For ASP.Net, the ports are configured in the launch.json and for node, proxy information is set up in a proxy.config.json file. Below is a simple example of the proxy config I use most often to route api requests to the ASP.Net port. It is also good to remember both apps are running locally under localhost.

Scout APM provides developers and application administrators software performance insights by delivering key web application performance metrics. 
Traditionally an APM tool, Scout has expanded its service offerings to now include error monitoring of web applications for more cohesive and actionable observability insights within a single platform. This new feature supports an overall better user experience by eliminating the need for multiple web-application monitoring services; Scout APM with Scout Error Monitoring offers performance and error insight and alerting within a single, integrated dashboard.
‚ÄúScout‚Äôs industry-leading performance and, now, error monitoring solutions are essential for developers building performant, cloud-native applications,‚Äù says Jason Hable, Scout‚Äôs CEO. ‚ÄúWe wanted to expand our services to build a more holistic performance and exception monitoring tool to help our customers solve issues quickly and efficiently. By connecting error reporting and performance monitoring data in one platform we provide our customers with the insights they need without paying for the features they don‚Äôt.‚Äù
Multiple trends and factors have contributed to the growth of both the APM and error monitoring markets in recent years. Companies are experiencing an increased reliance on advanced data analytics and automation as cloud computing and containers become progressively mission-critical.

Intelligent and balanced scheduling of containers
Creation, deletion, and movement of containers
Easy scaling of containers
Monitoring and self-healing abilities
Challenges with Previous Technologies


Before Kubernetes there were containers, which became popular because they simplified going from application development to deployment without having to worry about portability or reproducibility. Developers can package an application and all its dependencies, libraries, and configuration files needed to execute the application into a container image. A‚Ä¶]]></summary>

Helm is a great addition to the Kubernetes ecosystem; it simplifies complex Kubernetes manifests by separating them into charts and values. 
Sharing charts has never been easier especially since all the customizable parameters are located separately (values.yaml). The downside of this is that there‚Äôs no single place to see the resulting manifest, as it‚Äôs usually compiled and installed in a single step - helm install. 
Helm alleviates this with a plugin system that allows you to seamlessly integrate with the Helm flow and easily run custom code that‚Äôs not part of the Helm core code which, as we‚Äôll see in the next section, can be written in any language, even Bash.

When it comes to building forms with React, there are tons of possibilities out there in the React Ecosystem. Many libraries have emerged to answer specific needs, and it can be a little bit overwhelming at first: which one to choose? what strategy to adopt? 
Even without using a library, just using pure React, you can basically go two ways: controlled or uncontrolled. We will briefly discuss this, so if you're new to React, you might want to start there. 
If you already know all about controlled VS uncontrolled forms, you can skip the first part and jump right to the second one, where I will show you how I like to build my forms today: using react-hook-form, yup and TypeScript. Those tools allow me to quickly build any type of form w‚Ä¶]]></summary>

Here's a guide to get you started in building a workflow around your Bear notes by exporting them to markdown files.

When you are managing Azure DevOps in a large enterprise organization, and you are still using only one Azure DevOps organization account, you are probably hitting some limits or have potential performance issues.

The solution is to set up a multi-organization structure. Move all the inactive projects to an archive or boneyard Azure DevOps organization account and add an extra Azure DevOps organization account per department.

To define which SSH keys have access to your server, each server user has its own directory and within, a folder called .ssh. This folder should have a file called authorized_keys and the purpose of this file is to hold the public key for each SSH key that should have access.
It's a very simple system that works great, as it's a simple case of adding a new public key on a new line in the file and saving it, (or deleting a line to remove access).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes when writing an app in React you might have a component that changes its look and logic dramatically depending on provided props. In addition, if a particular prop provided, the other props become either required or restricted. That hidden prop relation can be explained in documentation but if your project uses Typescript there is a great opportunity to utilize what I call "sets of props".
It's usually not the best idea to make buttons look like links and vice versa but let's ignore this for the sake of clarity. The code snippet below is so-called Clickable component which can be either a link or a button that shares the same style but has different behavior depending on props.
import { ReactNode } from 'react'

interface BaseProps {
  children: ReactNode
}

interface AsButtonProps extends BaseProps {
  as: 'button'
  onClick: () => void
  href?: never
}

interface AsLinkProps extends BaseProps {
  as: 'a'
  href: string
  onClick?: never
}

type ClickableProps = AsButtonProps | AsLinkProps

const Clickable = ({ children, as, onClick, href }: ClickableProps) => {
  return (
    <>
      {as === 'a' && (
        <a href={href}>{children}</a>
      )}

      {as === 'button' && (
        <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>
      )}
    </>
  )
}

export default Clickable

The component has four props. children is required in any case so it's put under the BaseProps interface. Both AsButtonProps and AsLinkProps extended from BaseProps and represent two sets of props. The active set depends on the value of the as prop while the type never for unused props makes sure that Typescript will yell if someone is using a prop which does nothing.
Here is a scheme:

This pattern is obviously not limited to props in React. It's widely used in the types of various npm packages. Now you can add it to your arsenal and build reusable components/utils with better API for you and your team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[üìì SOC 2 is a technical security audit report from the AICPA that evaluates a tech service business‚Äôs cloud security controls.


In the last two years alone, cloud-based cyberattacks more than doubled ‚Äî even though SaaS spending grew just 18%. 
While these numbers are merely a correlation from a statistical standpoint, it does indicate that if your business stores customer data in the cloud, it‚Äôs more important than ever for your business to take measures to secure that data. Especially given SaaS spending is expected to increase an additional 36% between 2020 and 2022. 
A SOC 2 certification from the AICPA is a foundational step that will help every service provider reduce security risks. Below is a guide to SOC 2 compliance requirements and certification.
SOC 2 is an independent audit report that evaluates the security controls a tech service business uses to protect the data they process in the cloud. Possession of a SOC 2 report is considered table stakes in the SaaS industry, as the answers to most security questions a customer may have about their business‚Äôs security posture can usually be pulled from this report.
‚ÄúSOC‚Äù stands for ‚ÄúSystem and Organization Controls‚Äù and was created by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). SOC 2 is one of three SOC reports, each with different purposes and/or levels of transparency:
SOC 1. Used to audit internal controls relevant to a customer‚Äôs financial systems. Report usage is ‚Äúrestricted,‚Äù meaning its use is limited to auditors, the service organization, and authorized users.
SOC 2. Used to audit the overall management of customer data. Report usage is also ‚Äúrestricted‚Äù the same way SOC 1 is.
SOC 3. The same as SOC 2, but the report is simplified and publicly available to increase transparency.

In my case, this situation occurred because I wanted to email attach multiple log files.
Let's first look at the command itself.
zip options zip_name files

Where this works as follows:
zip: The Linux command to zip things
options: We can pass in arguments for the end zip results
zip_name: The output name, without the .zip part
files: One or more files comma separated
To show you the most simple zip command for one file, we could do this.
zip archive test.txt

This will create an archive.zip in that folder containing the test.txt file.

To install the zip command on Ubuntu or Debian systems, you can run the following command.

Rust in my opinion is very much like typescript on steroids. While Typescript may enforce types in your code if you happen to pass a string to a type expecting a number things will still compile and may even work as expected still. With Rust this is not the case. If you provide an unexpected type either things will not compile in the first place or your software will crash.

Forgive me, the Bart Simpson in me couldn't resist using 'Best Practices' once again. Sure, there's a lot to say to stamp out ‚Äúbest practice‚Äù and I agree with most arguments in the article. Framing something as a best practice is subjective, and it could give the impression of being arrogant. But, as grown-ups, I'm convinced most of us know how to deal with the term and see why it's used. So pick the practices you agree on, which you see as 'best' practices yourself.
I have the feeling that the importance of API Gateway in a setup is sometimes overlooked. AWS wrote down the practices themselves (also using the term 'Best practices üòâ). But IMHO, their documentation is a tad too brief. Also, the documentation lacks a 'WHY' in general.

They are necessary so that the library can internally cache your data correctly and refetch automatically when a dependency to your query changes. Lastly, it will allow you to interact with the Query Cache manually when needed, for example when updating data after a mutation or when you need to manually invalidate some queries.
Let's quickly have a look what these three points mean before I'll show you how I personally organize Query Keys to be able to do these things most effectively.

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be "hh:mm:ss" or "mm:ss" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a "pseudo" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.]]></summary>
