The degree is the number of edges that are connected to a vertex, for example, the vertex A has a degree of 1 and the vertex C has a degree of 2.
Graphs can be either directed or undirected, directed graphs are like a one-way street, undirected is like a two-way street.

Graphs can also have cycles.

Graphs might be a disconnected one, that means it consists of isolated subgraphs, or a connected one, in which all every pair of nodes are connected by an edge.

Graphs can be used to represent networks, websites structure, also used in path optimization algorithms, there are applications in other fields, such as linguistics, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The join method is used to join the elements of an array together to create a string. It takes an argument for the delimiter that is used to separate the array elements in the string.


Here's an example:




let arr = ["Playstation", "Rules"];
let str = arr.join(" ");

str would have a value of the string Playstation Rules.


Let's use the join method (among others) inside the sentensify function to make a sentence from the words in the string str. The function should return a string. For example, I-like-Star-Wars would be converted to I like Star Wars.




function sentensify(str) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}
sentensify("May-the-force-be-with-you");

Answer:




function sentensify(str) {
return str.split(/\W/).join(" ")

}
console.log(sentensify("May-the-force-be-with-you")); will return May the force be with you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The split method splits a string into an array of strings. It takes an argument for the delimiter, which can be a character to use to break up the string or a regular expression. For example, if the delimiter is a space, you get an array of words, and if the delimiter is an empty string, you get an array of each character in the string.


Here are two examples that split one string by spaces, then another by digits using a regular expression:




let str = "Hello World";
let byWords = str.split(" ");

let otherString = "How9are7you2today";
let byDigits = otherString.split(/\d/);

// byWords would have the value ["Hello", "World"]
// byDigits would have the value ["How", "are", "you", "today"]

Now let's use the split method inside the splitify function to split str into an array of words. The function should return the array. Note that the words are not always separated by spaces, and the array should not contain punctuation.




function splitify(str) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}
splitify("Hello World,I-am code");

If you remember from my other posts simply split the string to create a new array of words. A simple regular expression can be used to achieve this result.
/\W/ Matches any non-word character. This includes spaces and punctuation, but not underscores. It’s equivalent to /[^A-Za-z0-9_]/


Answer:




function splitify(str) {
let splitWords = str.split(/\W/)
return splitWords

}
console.log(splitify("Hello World,I-am code"));

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A side effect of the sort method is that it changes the order of the elements in the original array. In other words, it mutates the array in place. One way to avoid this is to first concatenate an empty array to the one being sorted (remember that slice and concat return a new array), then run the sort method.
Use the sort method in the nonMutatingSort function to sort the elements of an array in ascending order. The function should return a new array, and not mutate the globalArray variable.








var globalArray = [5, 6, 3, 2, 9];
function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line


  // Only change code above this line
}
nonMutatingSort(globalArray);

Answer:




var globalArray = [5, 6, 3, 2, 9];
function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
let copy = [...arr];
  copy.sort((a, b) => {
     return a - b;
})
     return copy;
}
console.log(nonMutatingSort(globalArray)); will return [2, 3, 5, 6, 9]

OR




var globalArray = [5, 6, 3, 2, 9];
function nonMutatingSort(arr) {
  return [].concat(arr).sort(function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  });
}
nonMutatingSort(globalArray);

Code Explanation:
First we concatenate the array taken in as a parameter to a new empty array.
Then Use the sort() method create a function to sort the new array in ascending order.

It supports the entire software delivery lifecycle, including build, document, test, package, stage, deployment, static code analysis, and deployments via plugins. Several tools (e.g. unit tests, report generation, SCM, etc.) can be integrated with Jenkins via plugins. Jenkins has been the most widely adopted tool for CI/CD, thanks to its energetic, active community. This Jenkins community offers more than  1800+ plugins 
The Jenkins project was started in 2004 (originally called Hudson) by  Kohsuke Kawaguchi. Initially created for Continous Integration (CI), today Jenkins is capable to orchestrate the entire software delivery pipeline – called Continuous Delivery (CD) and even further to provide Continuous Deployment.
Following is a diagrammatic representation of the Jenkins pipeline.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running a bash script is easy, but it does take a few steps and it’s important to do them in the right order. In this post, we’ll go through the steps to ensure that your script will run correctly 😉
The first step is to make a bash script. Any bash script uses the Linux commands.  A script can simply be a file with a list of commands and the .sh extension. If you are new to Linux, you can use this site to practice. 
The second step is to make sure that your script file is executable. In Linux and macOS, you can check if a file is executable by running the ls -l command and then looking for an x in the permissions column. 
The example below shows the difference:
$ ls -l *.sh
-rwxrwxr-x 1 frank frank   43 mei 29 16:30 hello.sh
-rw-rw-r-- 1 frank frank 8192 jul  1 19:41 not-executable.sh

If it isn’t executable, run the following command in Terminal.
chmod +x script.sh

To start a script you write:
./script.sh

I can write a shell script when I need to, but then continue working in Python or Perl or C++ or whatever real programming language I'm most comfortable with at the time (these days mostly C++).
For example, one of my recent side projects involved crunching data from a database, working with various embedded systems and more. Shell is not the right tool for that kind of application.
Bash is more suited for when you write a lot of commands in the shell anyway and want to automate that.]]></summary>

The Visual Studio Code editor has all the tools to debug Node.js applications effectively. Its built-in debugger can debug any application that targets the Node.js runtime, even if the source code for the application is a language that transpiles to JavaScript, such as TypeScript.
When beginning a debugging session, you must inspect the call stack and any scoped variables in their current state. You can also evaluate expressions in the editor and step through the code to drill into the problematic parts.
Setting up a project for Node.js debugging is not particularly difficult, and this tutorial will help you get it right on the first try!

Modern employees require more flexibility than their previous counterparts. 
54% of employees say they’d rather shift to a career that offers them more flexibility. In other words, organizations are more likely to retain employees if they offer flexible work arrangements.
But shifting from in-person work to remote work comes with a full host of changes (and something to keep in mind when starting a business). The most crucial one? Making sure your remote team is set up to work safely and securely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have discovered and used vim as my primary text editor for the past few years.
Vim, an acronym meaning Vi IMproved, is a ubiquitous text editor available on nearly every system imaginable. 
Even in the most arcane corners of life, you will find a version of vim. From the data center to the local science lab to the classroom to the server farm, there is probably a version of vim running.
Vim is a text editor that operates in the console. It is very popular among programmers, and is particularly well-suited to editing source code.

Vim is often used by terminal users. But it can also be used inside modern IDEs (vim mode) and there are graphical versions as well (gVim)
In this post, I'm going to lay out a Hacker's Guide to Vim. This will be a collection of the best "Vim resources" that I have come across. 
Vim is a very complex tool with hundreds of commands and thousands of plugins that can be used to extend Vim and add functionality. So where do you start?
You can learn vim by exercise. This site offers interactive exercises. Vim is one of the programs you learn by doing.
Of course, the official vim website is a good resource as well. It has some documentation and lets you download vim. If you use Linux vim or vi is probably already installed, the same for Mac OS X users.
How to setup vim for Python. I find it quite useful, as I write quite a lot of Python code. Of course you can write Python code in any editor you want, I find for small scripts it's very practical to fire up vim.
An introduction to vim. This article shows you the basics of vim. How to open a terminal, vim and how to quit (ESC ZQ).
Settings up vim for javascript. If you write a lot of JS code, you can use vim. You can also use vim-mode inside visual studio code or phpstorm.
A cheatsheet for vim. Shows an overview for the vim commands. While a cheat sheet is useful, i think it's better to practice a lot with the commands.
A list of vim plugins. Personally I use NerdTree quite a bit.
Do you know any others? Which plugins do you use?]]></summary>

Students minimize PII (personally identifiable information) exposure with third-party organizations and the university (i.e., where their credentials are presented).

    value: function(min, max) {

One can increase their organization’s efficiency and agility by application or software modernization. Application modernization is a gateway to continuously improve your organization by refactoring a monolithic application into a set of independently developed, managed and deployed microservices.
Although you can use monolithic applications for a few use cases, modern features usually don’t work in an application based on monolithic architecture. Monolithic applications can become large and unmanageable that require coordination and effort from multiple teams, even if a small change is needed.
That’s why by choosing microservices you can decentralize your data stores and promote polyglo…]]></summary>

So let's get started.
Semantic versioning is such an important thing that, every developer needs to understand it whether you are a Node, React or Angular developer.
It’s also one of the frequently asked interview questions.
It defines how to manage the dependencies of npm packages that we install.
So let's understand some basics.
When we create any new Node or React project from scratch we execute the following command:
npm init -y

OR 

yarn init -y

This will create a basic package.json file where we can manage the dependencies of packages.
Normally, the package.json will look like this.

--
ng add @nguniversal/express-engine

Once this is done, let's quickly check if SSR is working as per our expectation.
npm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr

Node server fires up on port 4000 and I check for my webpage's source.
view-source:http://localhost:4000/


ng add @angular/pwa

No extra configurations so far, and that's how it will be. Let's build our universal application once again and serve it on localhost:4000.
But wait!!! Now when I view my webpage source on the browser, I get this:

So does this mean that my SSR is broken?
Nope! My SSR is perfectly fine :-) Let's run a quick check to prove this. Open up POSTMAN and run a GET request against http://localhost:4000. And voila! I see my server-side-rendered page once again!

--
index.html is now cached by service-worker at the browser. The browser does not need to wait for the server to render the content any more, and it simply serves the cached version, and Angular takes over thereafter, like a normal SPA. Open up ngsw-config.json and verify that index.html is one of the cached resources.

Note (and a small exercise): If you remove index.html from ngsw-config.json and re-build your universal, you would see that the server-rendered content is back on your browser source, since the HTML is now no longer being cached!

However, not all solutions require the use of an external source. In case you have no idea how big the application will reach in the early days, using an internal cache can save you a lot of deployment time.
But you have to pay attention to one thing, if your application grows fast or if you already have a good number of daily requests, I always recommend using an external source. This is because by storing data in your application's cache, you will increase your application's memory leaks.
I know a lot of people who don't care about memory leaks, however, if your application consumes a lot of RAM, the system may interrupt the application's execution…]]></summary>

This is for if you have troubles downloading large files while on a company network, or want to download files faster using Linux or Mac. 
1). Download aria2
Through brew: brew install aria2

Other systems: https://aria2.github.io/

Ubuntu Example:




2). cd to your downloads directory.
3). Run the following command:
aria2c --file-allocation=none -c -x 10 -s 10 $URL

4). Replace $URL with the download URL of the file you are trying to pull.
On the corporate network, downloading the docker for mac was taking upwards of an hour. 
Downloading with aria2c:

The download was much quicker due to multi-threaded downloads! 😄

Let's start from type system itself.
type User = {

Is it possible to mutate this type?
How would you change the type of name property to number?
There are several ways to do this:
type User = {
    name: string;
}

type User1 = User & {
    name: number;
}

type User2 = {
    [P in keyof User]: P extends 'name' ? number : User[P]

For us as an engineering team, this translates into a lot of complex business logic. And we want to do our best to make sure that logic is sound. If our logic is faulty it can lead to thousands of dollars of disappointment. We do not want that. Thus, we thoroughly test our code via unit testing.
We are in a growth stage at Knock so we are regularly bringing on new engineers. During this process we have learned that it can be difficult for new engineers to come to grips with our testing code base while at the same time recognizing the patterns and strategies used in our unit tests. As a result, we have started a new open repository that provides lessons for any engineer to learn from and reference. We think this repository fills a gap in the community and are thus making it available for anyone to reference and contribute to: https://github.com/knockaway/unit-test-patterns-and-strategies.
Have we missed any patterns or strategies? We welcome pull requests to add more. And if you're looking to join a team that cares about the quality of their code, we're hiring!]]></summary>

Strapi is a headless CMS(Content Management System) for Nodejs to build and develop APIs, and its content super-fast and accessible in a friendly UI.
It is also self-hosted, meaning you can build your APIs in the UI, and Strapi will still host and server the API endpoints for you. With this, you can push your Strapi server to any cloud host for the world to use your APIs.
APIs are built-in Strapi in the name of collections, although they now support single-type API. For example, this collection will provide endpoints on all the HTTP verbs: POST, PUT, DELETE, GET.

Cloud computing has seen a shift from traditional Java deployments to application servers like Tomcat to highly dynamic environments such as serverless and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
Many of the benefits of these new cloud platforms rely on their ability to quickly spin application instances up to meet additional demand and restart applications to adapt to infrastructure changes like operating system upgrades or virtual machine provisioning.
Deploying Java to these environments has been a challenge, though, largely due to the amount of time it takes even a basic Java web application to start, called the cold boot time. It is not uncommon to have to wait 30 seconds or more before your application can begin serving traffic, which becomes a problem on platforms that scale down to zero waiting for incoming traffic and expect to quickly launch an application to process a request.
Quarkus is a container native platform that addresses many of these performance issues, and in this blog post, we'll take a look at a simple Quarkus web application exposing a REST endpoint protected by Auth0.
Quarkus has been designed to address the needs of serverless and container environments by reducing startup times and memory consumption. Perhaps the most exciting thing about Quarkus is its tight integration with GraalVM to allow applications to be compiled into native binaries.
Quarkus integrates with a huge range of libraries, giving developers access to many familiar platforms and allowing for the migration of existing code bases. These libraries are selected or customized to run seamlessly on Quarkus and to be able to take advantage of native compilation.
Of course, authentication is a central requirement of any modern web application, and Quarkus has out of the box support for OAuth, which in turn can be integrated into Auth0.

To work around this, you are usually forced to use a .htaccess file or special server configuration to route all of your requests to the correct destinations. This issue makes hosting frontend framework applications cumbersome in a cloud storage scenario.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say you need an object with the shape of Record<string, { s: string } | { n: number } | { b: boolean }>. You fire up your IDE and write down something like this:
type A = { s: string };
type B = { n: number };
type C = { b: boolean };

type MyObject = Record<string, A | B | C>;

Great, you can now type check your object literals:
const o1: MyObject = {
  a: { s: 1 }, // error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
};

// all good
const o2: MyObject = {
  a: { s: "str" },
};

Open in TS playground →
Some time later you decide that you need to know the type of o.a, but it can't be inferred! Due to the MyObject type reference, the object literal type information is lost and all you are left with is A | B | C:
type T = typeof o2.a; // => A | B | C

Open in TS playground →
Moreover, because string is used as an indexed access type of Record, TS will not warn you about the non-existent property access:
// TS guess:      `A | B | C`
// Harsh reality: `undefined`
const value = o2.j;

Open in TS playground →
The autocomplete is also not available in this case.
Fortunately, we can leverage the power of generics to both type check the object literal and preserve type information:
type Constraint = Record<string, A | B | C>;

function identity<T extends Constraint>(x: T): T {
  return x;
}

const o = identity({
  a: { s: "a" },
});

type T = typeof o.a; // => { s: string }

Open in TS playground →
The extends clause of the type parameter enforces the correct type of the object:
const o = identity({
  a: { s: 1 }, // error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
});

Open in TS playground →
At the same time, the literal type information is preserved because the identity function returns exactly what it have received: T, which is the (literal) type of the object literal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a self-thought developer like myself who basically dabbled into backend development, php was probably a more welcoming language. A great community and an easy to digest syntax. I’m pretty sure when you wrote your first program that worked on the browser you felt pretty badass. 
Going on as you advance, from an absolute beginner to a beginner (lol), you probably start to get erky with the amount of extra software to run a server. Database management and server maintenance which comes with apache pretty much helps a lot in reducing the difficulty with setting up and maintaining a database. 
So if you are a frontend developer looking to learn backend technologies, php might be a great start, but if you are conversant with JavaScript, to reduce the extra time spent learning new syntax, it might be better to stick with Nodejs. 
Nodejs is a JavaScript framework that gives you more control in managing the backend of your web based application. 
I wish you the very best in your learning activity!]]></summary>

A strictly typed schema is one of the great benefits of using Graphql. This schema acts as a contract between the backend and the frontend. When working on products that use Graphql as the backend API layer, I observed 2 types of working arrangements between team members :
Same developer owns the backend work and the front end work. In this scenario the graphql schema evolves alongside the front end code and requirements.
Multiple (2 or more) developers of same or different teams collaborate on different parts of frontend and backend
This write-up aims to address the second point where developers working on different parts of the app or feature need to do the following things:

This configuration can be used as is in any Angular tsParticles installation (ng-particles package).
app.module.ts
import { NgParticlesModule } from "ng-particles";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [/* ... */],
  imports: [/* ... */, NgParticlesModule],
  providers: [],

A lightweight TypeScript library for creating particles. Dependency free (*), browser ready and compatible with React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, jQuery, Preact, Inferno
         
This library is available on the two most popular CDNs and it's easy and ready to use, if you were using particles.js it's even easier.
You'll find the instructions below, with all the links you need, and don't be scared by TypeScript, it's just the source language.
The output files are just JavaScript. 🤩
CDNs and npm have all the sources you need in Javascript, a bundle browser ready (tsparticles.min.js) and all files splitted for import syntax.
If you are still interested some lines below there are some instructions for migrating from the old particles.js library.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Se você desenvolve em Javascript, com certeza já deva ter usado muito o método log do objeto console. Porem, ele não e o único meto que este objeto possui, continue lendo para ver outros métodos que podem ser muito uteis.
Índice




assert


dir


table


time & timeEnd


warn & error


clear




  
  
  Assert


Exibe uma mensagem caso a expressão passada resulte em falha. Sua mensagem pode ser tanto uma String, Array ou Objeto.
Detalhe, caso esteja usando Node.js, os efeitos são diferentes. Caso a expressão falhe, será gerado um AssertionError.
Exibe uma lista interativa das propriedades do objeto. Muito útil para analisarmos algum elemento HTML, checar propriedades.

Com Dir teremos uma interação melhor:

Exibe dados em forma de tabela de um Objeto ou Array. muito útil para termos uma visão melhor e limpa dos dados do que apenas o console.log() nos mostra. Veja exemplo a seguir:
A iteração do Array simples temos a coluna de índice e outra com valor, ja um Array multidimensional temos mais colunas de acordo com sua dimensão, ja um Objeto temos suas Chaves e Valores bem claros a vista.
Iniciar um cronômetro com console.time() e finaliza apenas quando for chamado console.timeEnd(). Muito útil caso tenha um aparte do seu código que você deseja saber quanto tempo leva de execução. Veja exemplo a seguir:
No final da execução será exibido tempo que o Time foi aberto ate TimeEnd ser chamado.
Similar ao Log, porem Warn exibe uma mensagem de alerta e Error exibe uma mensagem de Erro. Muito útil para especificar quando e uma falha maleável e quando ocorrer um erro de fato. Veja exemplos:

Por fim, o método Clear limpa o console, se o ambiente permitir.
Vemos que nem de console.log() pode viver um desenvolvedor Javascript. Espero que este conteúdo tenha agregado mais conhecimento.]]></summary>

IoT security is tough to implement. A major contributing factor is the complexity of IoT and its many factors. Instead of the back end, there's network security and physical device security to consider as well.
The current landscape values ease of use over security. As Manuel Pais points out in DZone's guide to IoT, there's an onus on plug-and-play capability. This prioritizes operability and usa…]]></summary>
