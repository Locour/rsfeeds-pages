Still, soon enough, you’ll realize that this approach can be a burden and is unscalable, especially in a distributed architectural system.
Suppose you found a solution that serves as a universal secrets manager and allows you to synchronize environment variables at scale efficiently. Would this help you solve your problem better than ENV files? The answer is YES, and the best solution for your issue is Doppler.

 In React, you can pass props, or properties, to child components.
For example, let's say you have an App component which renders a child component called Welcome which is a stateless functional component. You can pass Welcome a user property by writing




<App>
  <Welcome user='Randy' />
</App>

The property user is passed to the component Welcome. Since Welcome is a stateless functional component, it has access to this value like this.




const Welcome = (props) => <h1>Hello, {props.user}!</h1>

You can access the value of the argument in the function body. With class components, you will see this is a little different.


Ex:




const CurrentDate = (props) => {
  return (

      <p>The current date is: </p> { /* Change code i…]]></summary>

Vim is the dark side of the programming, you can rule everyone with vim. 
Vim has several modes with different functions but these are the  most commonly used.
Normal mode is Vim's default mode. When you are in normal mode you can navigate, perform operations, and destroy your keyboard.
h -> move to left
j -> move to down
k -> move to up
l -> move to right
0 -> move to the beginning of the line
$ -> move to the end of the line
w -> move to the next word
b -> move to the back word
e -> move to the end of current word
gg -> move to the beginning of current buffer
G -> move to the end of current word
q -> exit from the editor
w -> save the editor
In this mode you can enter text, delete and edit the document.
i -> enter insert mode to the left of the cursor.
a -> enter insert mode to the right of the cursor.
I -> enter insert mode to the beginning of the line.
A -> enter insert mode to the end of the line.
o -> enter insert mode one line down.
O -> enter insert mode one line up.
In this mode you can select parts of the document, copy them, cut them, delete them and paste them.
y -> yunk the selected characters.
d -> cut or deleted the selected characters.
p -> paste.

Next.js allows you to register redirects using redirects function inside next.config.js


Nuxt.js allows you to register redirects using redirect-module in nuxt.config.js


Universal allows you to register redirects at server engine router level. e.g. @nguniversal/express-engine



But in all the cases when your app is served, it should stay on top of a nodejs server to handle all the requests.
But I want my application to be a static served application that lives only on client, without a server 😢
Well, this is the single limitation of all the frameworks redirects, but don't be sad, we have a solution, that comes with it's own limitations 😄

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever used Array.filter to filter a list to certain type of items, you've probably been hit by TypeScript not realizing what type of items your list contains after filtering. To fix this, you can use user-defined type guards.
Let's say we have content items of two type: Post and Image.
interface Post {
    text: string;
    title: string;
    date: Date;
}

interface Image {
    url: string;
    alt: string;
    date: Date;
}

We are going to store items of both types in a array.

type Content = Post | Image;
const content: Content[] = [
    {
        title: "A post",
        text: "...",

Emergency Response Africa is a healthcare technology company that is changing how medical emergencies are managed in Africa.

The importance of securing access to resources from these client applications can't be overstated. The wrong user having access to the wrong resources can cause a lot of problem.
In this post, I'll discuss in detail how we handle Authorization to our internal APIs using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and how we determine the extent of the permissions to assign to the client making the request.
Authorization is the process of verifying the resources a client has access to. While often used interchangeably with authentication, authorization represents a fundamentally different function. To learn more, read this post on Authentication and Authorization by Aut…]]></summary>

I will develop a simple movie web application with refine on the frontend and Supabase on the backend, you should continue reading. I will try to explain it step by step in a very simple way.
There are two alternative methods to set up a refine application.
The recommended way is using the superplate tool. superplate's CLI wizard will let you create and customize your application in seconds.
Alternatively, you may use the create-react-app tool to create an empty React application and then add refine module via npm.
I will use superplate-cli and select a Supabase. You can customize other options as you wish.

A CI build process will be triggered by a User pre-push Git Hook. At the end of each build the CI pipeline status will be displayed on the Git repository (if you want, you can even stop user pushing code change if the CI process fails 🛑 )

If the User branch or Pull request is ✅ , we can use Github or Bitbucket api for merging the code/Pull Request.

First we should know how to create private sub-networks with Docker engine.
Docker engine allows you to create multiple networks.
containers for each network.
The Docker configuration will be:

"Gateway": "172.20.X.12"

const availableNetwork = 1;

const networkConfig = {
  "Subnet": `172.20.${availableNetwork}.0/24`,

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a broad term to describe how responsibility for some aspect of a system is lifted out of the custom code written by the end developer and into a framework. Martin Fowler describes a framework in terms of IoC:
Inversion of Control is a key part of what makes a framework different from a library. A library is essentially a set of functions that you can call, these days usually organized into classes. Each call does some work and returns control to the client.
A framework embodies some abstract design, with more behavior built-in. In order to use it, you need to insert your behavior into various places in the framework, either by subclassing or by plugging in your ow…]]></summary>

So, let us discuss setting up an Apple push notification service (APN) with a Node.js application today.
In this blog, we will discuss in detail the APN services, enable and register for remote notifications, device token ids, and APN node package with the help of a sample iOS. Make sure to have a physical iOS device, as push notifications won't work with the simulator. Also, an Apple Developer Program Membership account is a must for creating a Push Notifi…]]></summary>

Yes, one might need a programming DevOps career. However, before jumping into further details, we have to understand what DevOps means.
A company's ability to deliver applications and services at high speed is enhanced by combining cultural schools of thought, procedures, and methods known as DevOps; rather than using conventional software development and infrastructure management procedures. As a result, organizations can better DevOps consulting service their clients and compete in the market with this increased speed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NodeJs Environment Variables


Environment variables in NodeJs are essential for setting configuration options as well as storing important values securely. NodeJs by default comes with some environment variables that describe various parts of the application and the infrastructure it is being run on.
These variables, along with any custom added ones are available inside the process.env object that can be accessed in any script file within the app.
The environment variables allow you to store API keys and other configuration secrets independently from your main codebase and separate from your git repository so they never get checked in anywhere. 
Being able to configure and consume these variables is essential in creating solid, production-ready NodeJs APIs for all applications.

The following below points explain various challenges posed for application security:
Lack of security awareness
Sometimes, even experienced web application developers are overconfident about their coding practices and make big assumptions about the security provided by their programming frameworks and security protocols, resulting in poor programming and attracts hackers to find vulnerability in their application.
Lack of resources and experts
Rapidly growing zero-day vulnerabilities
Increasing functionalities in the application

As you most likely already know bots can have a negative impact on your website in a variety of ways:
Wasting server resources, thus slowing down response times for human visitors
Scraping the website content, which was made to be unique
Faking human-generated content (eg. customer reviews)
Performing various malicious action
Also, in the world of eCommerce bots are able to monitor prices, fake orders and monitor stock levels. 
So, if you’ve been using an anti-bot solution, did you have it “tailor-made” or was it off-the-shelf? How satisfied are you with it? Were you able to measure if it was a good investment? How did you come to the conclusion that you should use one in the first place?

Se você ainda hospeda as suas aplicações frontend em servidores web como apache ou nginx, sinto dizer mas você provavelmente está perdendo dinheiro.
Quando se fala em serverless, sempre pensamos no Lambda da AWS, no Google Cloud Functions, App Engine, etc. Eu mesmo hospedei aplicações Angular usando contêineres por bastante tempo, até surgir a seguinte dúvida:
Se servimos arquivos estáticos, pra que diabos a gente precisa subir um servidor?

To follow along, you'll need at least some knowledge about building a backend server (could be in any language or framework, but I used TypeScript in combination with NestJS) and some general API knowledge.
You'll also need to integrate Google Analytics into your website, but you probably guessed that already. (I also won't show that part here)

  A tip from the video: snippets.


For some reason I was very reluctant to make my own snippets. A mean I used build-in ones, or the ones that come with extensions, but I never made my own. Until recently I was using css modules and I got really tired typing import for my styles.
So I decided to give it a shot. Turns out even if it does not save you tons of time, I mean typing is like 1% of programming, it surely makes you feel better. So I guess my advice is if you get annoyed about typing something over and over, consider turning that thing into a snippet.
And here is that css modules snippet I was talking about for VS Code.
{
  "Import css module": 
  {
    "prefix": "mcss",
    "body": [
      "import styles from ./$TM_FILENAME_BASE.module.css'"
    ]

This time, I will try decorators.
As a result, I couldn't do that in this time.
So I just tried using them in this time.
TypeScript ver.4.4.3
Webpack ver.5.56.0
webpack-cli ver.4.8.0
I think the decorators are special kinds of functions for classes and class members.
// Compile error: Decorators are not valid here
@message("Hello World")
export function funcSample() {
}

I can add decorators into classes, methods, properties, accessors, and paramters.
import { Sample } from "./sample";

function init(): void {
    const s = new Sample();
    s.userName = 'Masanori';
    s.greet('Hello!');
}

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Storybook and Angular components


Context : Angular 12, StoryBook 6.3.9
Hey, I started to use Storybook and I would Like to share my experience. Here’s the use case. I have a simple component which only use content projection:
@Component({
  selector: "adr-label",
  template: `<ng-content></ng-content>`,
})
_export class_ LabelComponent {}

Here’s the associated story:
_export default_ {
  title: "atoms/forms/label",
  component: LabelComponent,
  decorators: [**componentWrapperDecorator** (LabelComponent)],
} _as Meta_;

_const_ BasicTemplate: _Story_<LabelComponent> = (args) => ({
  moduleMetadata: { declarations: [InputDirective] },
  **template** : `<adr-label>{{ ngContent }}</adr-label>`,
  props: { ...args },
});

_export const_ Default = BasicTemplate.bind({});
Default.args = {
  **ngContent** : "Un label",
};

The specificity here is to use a componentWrapperDecorator. It allows to wrap our component and to pass it some extras like in my case a text content.
You just have to define a template like in BasicTemplate to emulate the content projection and using it like an input.
In the Default args, I add an ngContent arg to set the content of my label. I choose this name “ngContent” because it appears in the controls list and I find it consistent to let know that’s a content projection in this way.
You can see the result here:

Why would you use VIM when we have modern IDEs? The answer is, when you write code, your fingers should be bound to keyboard all the time. Every time you touch mouse your work rate is interrupted.
Linux/MacOS: VIM comes preinstalled.
Windows: Download VIM, Download the installer and install it. 
Linux/MacOS: Type "vim filename.txt" in terminal (without quotations)
Windows: Open "gVim8.1" from desktop or search in start menu.

If you’re like me and run a home Linux server, you may wish to add some extra security in the form of a VPN connection to ensure traffic is encrypted. In my case, I use a Raspberry Pi to backup things like RAW images from my camera to an off-site location. The extra security gives me a little peace of mind, especially as the server generally uses a cellular connection.
I’ve been using UFW to work as a killswitch and only allow traffic via the VPN connection, but one issue I've had is with my trusted VPN provider is that they regularly rotate IP addresses. UFW uses iptables under the hood, meaning it can only be configured to use IP addresses explicitly and not a domain name. This has left my backup machine without an internet connection fairly frequently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog summarises on use case in which common chunk is created in an Angular application.
We will start by creating a new angular application using ng new my-app command present in cli.
In this application we will have a toast module which will show toast on click of a button.
We will load toast module inside multiple modules and check how its shipped to the user.
It doesn't included basic Angular commands like creating component, module.
Let's start then.
As a first use case we will include the toast module in the main app module.

You can capture errors as they happen, with zero involvement from application users. Then of course you can work to fix the error, contact end users or whatever might seem appropriate on each case.
As part of this article we examine how we can setup proactive monitoring using Angular 12 and Datadog, by following two different approaches. The implementation should be similar for React and Vue and of course this can be adjusted to use Sentry or any other Datadog alternative.
Datadog is mostly popular as a cloud and infrastructure monitoring but it can be also used as a centralized logging platform. Personally I find that you get better application insights when you combine infrastru…]]></summary>
