        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A well-designed microservices architecture is an amazing thing. When each service is responsible for its own specific domain and can be deployed independently, it allows for unparalleled flexibility and productivity for backend teams. However, very few decisions are all benefit with no cost - including our decision to choose microservices over a monolithic backend. 
Before we migrated our backend to GraphQL, one trade-off that we encountered was the additional complexity that it imposed on our client-side networking code - especially when we had to create views that used data from multiple services.
For example, our application had a "appointment list" view that looked a little something like this:

In a monolithic architecture, the networking code for this page could be trivial. It would …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Shopping List project is open source and you can find it on GitHub.
There, you are going to find instructions on how to build it and how to run it locally.
The frontend is written in Angular and the backend in Quarkus. The database is PostgreSQL. They are deployed as containers on Heroku and the HTTP communication is protected by JWT tokens.
I describe the technique used to deploy them as containers on Heroku in this article on medium.
You can access this demo version running on Heroku and try it right now. But as this is only a demo, please don't use a real password there!
The application get dormant after some time without use, so the first access can take some extra time.

Shopping List is a web application that was created especially for mobile devices.
You'll be able to organize the products you want to buy and do your shopping more quickly.
Once you create one account, you can create shopping lists and add products to them.
When you're buying products at the market, you can check the products updating your list and switch from one shopping list to other very easily.
You can, for instance, create one shopping list for fruits, other for cleaning products and another for grocery. So, in the top menu, you will be able to switch between these shopping lists while you're checking the products you already bought.

Application
API swagger
I used Angular Material and Angular Flex-Layout in this project.
On the Quarkus project I used Hibernate Panache to control the database and SmallRye JWT to protect the endpoints.
Perhaps you can find it interesting the Swagger-UI, created automatically by the SmallRye OpenAPI, that has the possibility of doing one Authentication to test the endpoints protected by JWT.
Thanks for reading this article and feel free to talk with me in case you got interested in this project!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR; Jump to the conclusions.
We have been told that a robust static type system can reduce the number of bugs in our applications, transforming a 2 a.m. production issue into a red squiggly in our text editor. This is an appealing proposition.
In this post, we will set the stage with some definition, a scenario, and a goal and see how this little adventure goes. We will then try to draw some conclusions.
A dynamic type system is a system where types are checked at runtime.
A static type system is a system where types are checked at compile time.
Let's imagine that our code needs a simple function that returns the last element of an array (let's call it "last").
Our goal is to have a system that would warn us if we try to call this function with anything other than an array and also ensur…]]></summary>

And the truth is, it is easier than it seems.
A decorator is nothing more than a "typical" Javascript/Typescript function what to add additional functionalities to a declaration. When we say declaration, we mean classes, methods, parameters, accessor (getter) and properties. Now, we are going to explain each one of them.

From picking the stack you want to use, along with CSS solutions, to how you're going to organize your content are all the decisions that you have to make. I have gone down this path a few times with my own blog built with just Angular, and Angular and Scully, and hosted solutions like Dev.to. I continue to want something with low-friction so that I could get my thoughts out and be able to write blog posts more quickly about things that I've learned along the way or things that I'm tinkering with. This post is how I started on a different path, ended up rebuilding my blog and became an Astronaut 🚀.

As I’m developing my products (the latest one being BotMeNot), I often wonder - do people actually mind data being scraped from their websites?
On the one hand, it’s publicly available information - meaning it’s up for grabs for any visitor. I’ve even read some people saying that if you don’t want information being collected from your website - don’t put it on the website in the first place. Do you agree or is this too harsh of a stance in your opinion?
On the other hand, it’s a very automated process of information gathering. Web scrapers are far more efficient than humans can ever hope to be. Does this make a difference to you?
Also, even if you’re not a website owner, please share your opinion!]]></summary>

Layering is not a novel concept. It's been around in the industry for more than a couple of years (some of you reading this document are probably younger than layering) and it's one of the first architectural styles created. In short, layering is nothing more than dividing the concerns of your application into different layers, like in a cake, where the upper layers can talk to the bottom layers but no the other way around.
Layers interact through facades, so as long as the public APIs are honored, a layer doesn't have to know anything about internal implementation details of other layers.

The primary idea is to have everything set up for quick start with components, modules and other stuff which many templates can't offer.
The core of this template is build around next dependencies:
React Native
React Native Navigation
Redux ToolKit
TypeScript
One of the main differences between this and any other template is that it offers a documentation to each of its component, helper, module, etc.
It offers more than just a simple template project it offers a guidance towards project, module, component creation.
From the component to publishing an app, it covers each aspect of development.
From the beginning it includes Hermes on both platforms, proguard is enabled, consoles are being removed and many other enhancements are used to provide the best performance.

Adding the next export enables next to build and store them in out folder, containing the static html of your app.
Note you can't using next methods like getServerSideprops or next image optimization with next export.
step 3:

GitHub Actions are event-driven workflows that come right in your code repository. By saying event-driven, it means that you can execute series of commands when specific event occurs. For example, every time someone creates a pull request for a repository, you can automatically run a command that executes a software testing script.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, Today we will create a demo in nodejs where image will be resize of the required dimension. As we need to generate thumbnail images in the application where we think all aspect to improve the performace of the application. A very basic steps are needed to perform the task. In nodejs applicationi it is verydifficult to resize or compress the image while uploading with multer package(in case of uploading file to our own server).
Click here to get complete working code.
For the image compression task we will use imagemagick package of nodejs. So at first we have to install imagemagick in our system, I am using linux with ubuntu. sudo apt-get install imagemagick will install the software in our system.
Now create a file named server.js and create a basic app of nodejs. I am not adding much thing here in the demo to clear the actual concept for image compression task in nodejs application. So I have written very basic code in my demo. Lets have a look in code of my package.json.

{
    "name": "node-resize-example",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "dependencies": {
       "imagemagick": "0.1.2"
   }
}

In the above file we can see that only one npm package has been installed.
Now move to the next file, server.js. Lets have a look inside it.
var im = require('imagemagick')
, path = require('path')

let convertArgs = [
'./images/tes.jpg',
'-resize',
300 + 'x' + 300,
'./images/thumbnail_test.jpg'
];

im.convert(convertArgs, function(err, metadata){
if (err) throw err;

console.log('success! Checkout your new thumb: ');
});

In the above file at top we have required the node packages. below that we have created a variable named convertArgs having first value as the current image second and value as the required size of thumbnail/resized images and last value as the name of the new file. At the end we call the convert method of imagemagick which  is performing the actual task. By following these easy steps we can compress/resize image in our nodejs app.

Bu hata ile karşı karşılaşanlar genelde aşağıdaki iki komutu çalıştırdığında karşılaşmakta:
hostnamectl
timedatectl
Komutlar çalıştırıldığında ise aşağıdaki gibi bir output döndürmekteler.

Bu sorunu çözebilmek için öncelikle dbus adlı servisin çalıştığından emin olunmalıdır.
systemctl status dbus

Eğer bu komut sonrası dönüt aşağıdaki gibi ise servisin bulunmadığını söylemektedir.

Bu durumda aşağıdaki komut ile servis yüklenir:
apt install dbus

Sonrasında servis otomatik olarak active hale gelmiş olabilir. Yine de kesinlik kazandırmak için servisi başlatmalı ve "enable" hale getirmeliyiz. Böylelikle makine her başladığında çalışır duruma gelebilmektedir.
systemctl start dbus
systemctl enable dbus

Eğer "systemctl status dbus" komutunun dönütü aşağıdaki gibi ise servis bulunmakta fakat aktif olmadığı anlamına gelmektedir.

Servis aktif edilir:
systemctl start dbus

Böylelikle dbus servisi sorunu çözümlenmiş olur. Eğer bu işlemlere rağmen çözüm sağlanılmamış ise bunun sebebi /var/run ile /run arasındaki gerekli symbolic linkin bozulmuş olması olabilir. Bunun için aşağıdaki komutlar çalıştırılır ve servisin durumuna bakılır:
sudo rm /var/run -R
sudo ln -s /run /var
sudo reboot]]></summary>

I've been a part of a number of different Angular front end projects in the past years. In every one of those projects, there came a point in time where we were asked to implement:
When a call to the backend fails due to authentication errors (401), route the user to the login page.
It didn't take long until another use case arrived:
When a call to the backend fails, alert the user of the failure with a generic "The requested operation failed".
Soon after, another use case:
When the user tries to get the information of an existing contact, and the operation fails, display a toast "Contact not found".
This would escalate further when the same operation failure would need a different error handling when done from different components. 
If the user tries to edit a…]]></summary>

It can be super daunting to use this API, because of the multiple steps required and the lack of snippets on the internet that you can use. I had some issues working with this API so I asked a question on Stack Overflow. After some trial and error and being ignored, I solved my own problem and posted the answer to my own question.
I am writing this because I couldn’t find anyone doing this with Javascript on the client and so I hope this will help others.
Let’s get started. To create a livestream first you should peruse the API documentation to get familiar with some of the terminology. To go live there are several steps: 1) authenticate t…]]></summary>

Password, key, or identification is the most broadly used and is one of the most important tools used by organizations to authenticate applications and users, providing them with sensitive systems, information, and services. Because secrets have to be transmitted securely, secret management has to account for and mitigate the risks to these secrets both in transit and at rest.
In this tutorial, we will create a simple lambda function,

We all know that API keys and connections can not be secured on the client side of an application.

After completing the process, I felt different about that “extra work”. The result was akin to painting by numbers.

After some searching I found two articles (links at the bottom) which describes the "sequence" which Unix follows when reading files. As summary, here's the files (in order):
/etc/profile
~/.bash_profile
~/.bash_login
4 ~/.profile
I added the function for .bashrc at the top of the .bash_profile:
## Loads .bashrc
if [[ -f ~/.bashrc ]] ; then
        . ~/.bashrc
fi

Closed terminal and reopened it 

Adding this great explanation from the reference link:
By default, Terminal starts the shell via /usr/bin/login, which makes the shell a login shell. On every platform (not just Mac OS X) bash does not use .bashrc for login shells (only /etc/profile and the first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile that exists and is readable). This is why "put source ~/.bashrc in your .bash_profile" is standard advice
Why doesn't .bashrc run automatically?
How do I set up my shell execution PATH?

What is the difference between .bash_profile and .bashrc?]]></summary>

The first thing to discuss is buffered writes. Any write to a linux local filesystem is done 'buffered', unless explicitly defined it not to, which is done by opening the file with the O_DIRECT flag. So all file interactions from the shell likely are done buffered, and the Postgresql database is also using buffered IO.
What happens when you perform a buffered write is that you don't actually write to the disk, but instead you write to memory. Because currently the latency of most disk IO/writes is still much higher than memory IO latency (~ 25us/modern SSD vs 160ns/memory, although very configuration specifi…]]></summary>

They may differ in the nature of their source code, cost, size, architecture, performance, and area of application. In this article, we would like to take a look at the options of the most popular open-source and closed-source OS families.
When it comes to the choice of operating systems, many medical device manufacturers may have the following questions in mind: What is the best OS for medical devices? Should I choose a Microsoft product? Is Linux better than Windows 10 IoT? The list goes on. A quick spoiler: There is no absolute answer to the question of what is better: Linux or Windows 10 IoT for medical devices. Both operating systems have a broad range of abilities and f…]]></summary>

Generally we use FormControl with either string or boolean types and hence it manages only simple values. But what if we want to manage just more than primitive data types? We can do that, let’s see how.
For example, in this tutorial we will learn how to get country-code and number as separate entities from the same form-control, and we will also create custom input for the same to handle the conversion between UI and value.
Let’s assume that we have a Telephone class, which will hold the related values:
export class Telephone {
  constructor(
    public countryCode: string,
    public phoneNumber: string
  ) {}
}

Next, let’s take an input[type=tel] in which we want to hold the Telephone:

💡 Unix-like operating systems such as Linux do not have an undelete command.
When we delete something with rm , it's gone.Linux assumes we're smart and we know what we're doing.

One of the big problem can cause wildcards. so be particularly with them.
For Example : if we want to delete just the JS files in directory we type:
rm *.js
* and the .js like so:
rm * .js
.js
There is many ways to avoid this problem, here is 2 useful tip: 
-i (interactive) option, which prompt the user for confirmation  ,before deleting an existing file.
rm i *.js
rm: remove regular empty file 'mk.js'?
2 - whenever we use wildcards with rm, test the wildcard first with ls. This will let we see the files that will be deleted. Then we can press the up arrow ☝️ to recall the command and replace ls with rm.]]></summary>

We use it in Angular all the time, from simple reactions to HTTP client responses to full-blown state management solutions. But sometimes, it is easy to miss some details and create a code that can break at the worst possible moment. 
Let’s start with an example right away.
of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  .pipe(
    tap(v => {
      if (v === 3) {
        throw new Error('some error');

    })
  )
  .subscribe({
    next: console.log.bind(null, 'next:'),
    error: (err: Error) => console.log('error:', err.message),
  });

We have an observable that emits numbers from 1 to 5, and if the number is 3, we throw an error.
We can see the following output.
next: 1
next: 2
error: some error

Numbers 4 and 5 were not processed at all.

Caph is the future of data storage whether it was objects, blocks or a file system. It provides a great alternative to self-hosted solutions such as GlusterFS in the realm of file systems and to managed services such as AWS S3 as an object storage where it makes more sense to host your own data because you have to store it on private cloud or simply to reduce costs as S3 costs sometimes grow to be pretty insane.

Praticamente todos os navegadores mantêm um cache da aplicação no computador do cliente para conseguir carregar a aplicação de forma mais rápida e com menor consumo de dados e isso é excelente. Entretanto, um efeito colateral é que as atualizações podem demorar para serem entregues para o cliente. Como consequência, o cliente pode ficar horas ou dias com uma versão com um bug que já foi corrigido.
Em sistemas internos de empresas, isso pode resultar em ligações ou tickets constantes para a equipe de suporte técnico, causando uma sobrecarga na equipe. Quando estamos falando de aplicações fornecidas para clientes externos à empresa, pode ser um ponto de frustração e insatisfação com o produto.
