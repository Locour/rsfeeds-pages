It refers to the process of automating the tasks necessary to turn source code into executable programs. Your choice of build tool would depend on the languages and frameworks you’re using. 
Today, we’ll focus on Java build tools. Java is one of the most commonly used languages in software development. There are many Java build tools available. We’ll compare two of the most popular build tools for Java development: Maven and Gradle. 
We’ll cover:
What is build automation?
What do build tools do?

WebAssembly is the new craze when it comes to frontend & backend capabilities. The part that has me excited about it is the concept that you can use the same library for both frontend & backend. (provided the backend is in Rust or NodeJs.)

Expected Prerequisites:
Rust
NodeJs
Yarn
First, we need to establish the goal of this little tutorial. This tutorial is to give a little demonstration of how to simply get Webpack to compile our Rust code into WebAssembly and import it on the frontend. To get started, lets create a new folder and enter it:
mkdir -p ./wasm-demo

With v13, View Engine is no longer available, replaced by Ivy. Ivy is the future of Angular applications, and the benefits are tremendous. After initially landing in v12, Ivy paves the way for new feature updates, simplifies existing capabilities, and increases rendering performance.

But what if that's just too much? What if you just want to see the data in Excel?
This is a common case - especially in schools that are introducing physical computing to CS students.

Whether using containers to support development or for packaging an application, it’s easy to take them for granted. But many things can go wrong with them: moved files, incorrect permissions, a user is missing, the Dockerfile is incomplete, the list goes on…
Containers are as crucial as the code they support. In this tutorial, we’ll introduce a different way of testing them before deployment.

You can consider a 'classic' way of passing data, is passing data through a JSON list or Database.
This often causes having to re-deconstruct the State in each new child component. 
To avoid this you can use the useContext hook in React, and pass it's props through a ContextProvider very easily.
This article will show you how to pass data from one central useContext that provides it's props to all components.

Have you ever faced the need to push a commit to a Git branch without changing any files in order to re-run your integration process? If yes then you are landed at the right place, my friend. 😉
git commit --allow-empty -m “Message”

For continuous integration, we are using  Buddy delivery pipelines which allow us to build, test and deploy applications on a single push to a specific git branch. It helps us to reduce the manual overhead of deploying code to the server and handle all the actions automatically.
But today I faced a problem where I needed to re-run my delivery pipeline of a branch without adding any extra space or changing any files in the repository, so I searched for the solution for a while and It turns out that Git is allowing us to push an empty commit without adding any staged files to the branch, by using one option  --allow-empty  during git commit.
Pushing a commit with staged files
git add .

git commit -m "changes on app controller"

git push origin master 

The above commands will add all unstaged files and add commit and push the code to the master branch, after that our delivery pipeline will be started.
Once the pipeline process fails or you need to run the process again, you will have to push something to the branch but as I mentioned earlier, we will not make any changes to the files, and even then, We will be able to commit the branch with this command.
Pushing empty commit
git commit --allow-empty -m "rerunning the delivery pipeline"

git push origin master 

After the above commands, you can see that the commit has been pushed to your branch and the delivery pipeline will be started.
You learned that you can be able to push an empty commit with the --allow-empty option of git commit. let me know in the comments if there is any other way to do this.]]></summary>

They also serve the same function, which is to serve as a proxy between clients and applications on one side, and to a postgres instance on the other side. In that position, the first obvious advantage is that it can perform as an edge service, concentrating connections from one network, and proxy the requests to the database in a non-exposed network.
Another advantage is that the client/application side connections are decoupled from the database side connections, and therefore can serve badly behaving applications (which create and destroy connections to a d…]]></summary>

The pod consists of one or more containers that are connected to each other and share storage yet run independently. An application-specific pod model contains one or more containers that go on the same machine. 

Kubernetes manages things like automatically restarting a pod when it fails. However, it sometimes happens that the pod does not start when you create it for the first time or update it with new configurations. This can happen for a variety of reasons. So,today, I'll briefly look at why this happens!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ReactJS:
React (ReactJS, React.js) is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces that are open-source. Facebook created, developed, and supports this useful tool, which can be downloaded from their Github page. Facebook updates and creates new guides for this collection on a regular basis.
Advantages of ReactJS:
ReactJs has a lot of experience with SEO. While other Javascript does not allow SEO, you can easily run your ReactJS with the servers.
Disadvantages of ReactJS:
React technologies are evolving and developing at such a rapid pace that there is no time to properly document them. To get around this, developers write their own instructions when new versions and tools in their present projects evolve.
AngularJS:
AngularJS is a framework for building dynamic web applications. It allows you to utilize HTML as your template language and enhance HTML's syntax to represent the components of your application clearly and succinctly. Data binding and dependency injection in AngularJS eliminate a lot of the code you'd have to write otherwise. And because it all happens in the browser, it's a great companion for any server technology.
Advantages of AngularJS:
Because Angularjs is an open-source JavaScript MVC framework, anyone can create a custom application at a low cost.
Disadvantages of AngualrJS:
In Angular, there is no server authorization or authentication. Authorization is the process of granting data access authorization and identifying a user by validating credentials. Because AngularJs is unable to fulfill both functionalities, we refer to it as "less secure."
AngularJs is totally dependent on JavaScript. If these scripts are hidden, the resulting pages appear to be rudimentary.
It's huge and complicated. There are numerous ways to execute the same operation in angular, making it impossible to determine which method is the most efficient.
AngularJs is not supported by Internet Explorer 8.0.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had the opportunity to create a simple backend program with CRUD operations using ExpressJS though I've been using NestJS. I personally enjoyed using NestJS a lot more than ExpressJS because 1) ExpressJS doesn't provide a structure for your project and 2) NestJS requires less set up.
1) Structure
I guess that freedom is good for others but bad for people with little experience. Let's get into the details of how it is different. Let's say that there are two different modules: User and Game. Nest structures this by putting all the User related files into a folder called User. That module would have a controller, service, repository, entity, and other testing files. ExpressJS, based on my personal experience, structures their projects according to its function. For example, all the controllers are grouped together and other routers are grouped together, etc.
Nest Controller == Express Router
1) Set up
Although learning dependency injection, inversion of control, and other weird crazy words is difficult in the beginning NestJS really helps users focus on the project at hand instead of the set up which is really convenient for me personally.]]></summary>

Serverless computing has become a term for how we build software. It is more than the compute; it is a mindset. A DataDog survey in 2020 stated that 50% of AWS users had serverless components, and container users are flocking to Lambda – one of the AWS Serverless Services. 
Many experts and leaders are still not convinced that Serverless will lead to the Future of Work and Emerging Technology. People don’t make the connection. What part does it play in the Future of Work and the 4th Industrial Revolution? We will explore this to help you learn in our blog content and case studies.

Store Tips


Put global state in a single place
Don't put the local state in the global store
Use selectors for the derived state
Use view model selectors
Treat actions as unique events
Group actions by source
Don't dispatch actions conditionally
Create reusable reducers
Be careful with facades
Effects Tips


Name effects like functions
Keep effects simple
Don't create "boiler" effects
Apply single responsibility principle
Apply good action hygiene

It will be looks like this

In a lot of cases not cancelling stale asynchronous tasks has few consequences, but in that case of network requests this can lead to unexpected behaviour such as race conditions.
This issue can be further complicated when network requests are spawned from a state management system where the result of the request is assigned to state. If uncancelled requests are allowed to complete, they may finish in an order you may not anticipate and thus corrupt your application state.

Sometimes when I'm learning a new paradigm, it's the seemingly simplest things that can trip me up. I often overlook certain concepts because they seem tricky at first.
TypeScript Generics is one of those concepts.
Let's take the example below:
interface Lengthwise {
  length: number;
}

function loggingIdentity<T extends Lengthwise>(arg: T): T {
  console.log(arg.length);
  return arg;
}

console.log(loggingIdentity(['hello world']))

If you're like me you might be asking:
What exactly is T here?
Why is T used, is that arbitrary?
Why can't I just write loggingIdentity(arg: Lengthwise)?
What does  mean?

If you don't care about the context of these tests and want to go straight to the node-fetch mocks, skip to the here's my solution section.
I wrote a middleware library to be used by micro-services that decodes and verifies JWTs and works with Express and Koa. The requirement was for the library to make an API request to an external service in order to refresh tokens if the provided token had expired. I'm not writing this post to discuss the library itself, but to talk about how I wrote the unit tests for it as I found it a little tricky to implement a solution that catered for sending and receiving dynamic data to and from the external service, whilst keeping the tests isolated. Hopefully this will be helpful to someone trying to do a similar thing.

Install lw-scanner
support.lacework.com and the the latest release of the scanner binary can be found at github.com
Once lw-scanner is installed the next step is to download the Lacework plugin from the VS Code Marketplace.

With an active Dockerfile in the editor you can initiate an image assurance scan by clicking Command+Shift+P on macOS (Control+Shift+P on Windows/Linux).

Once the scan is complete you will see a summary next to the base image that will disappear along with a more detailed scan result available in the output window.

Source code can be found here for now: github.
This is just a quick preview update. For suggestions or feedback please open an issue on the repo. PRs welcomed. Stay tuned for more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why rate limit?


Rate limiting is a simple way of stopping users (hopefully just the bad ones!) from accessing more of your sites resources than you would like.
I will show you a simple way to rate limit specific URLs by using Nginx.
The written instructions are below, but here is a quick video walkthrough showing how to apply rate limiting in Nginx.





  
  
  How to add rate limiting in nginx


At the top of you nginx file, you can define a map like so:
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr_map zone=mylimit:10m rate=5r/s;
limit_req_status 429;

map $request_uri $binary_remote_addr_map {
    default "";
    ~^/what-is-new.html $binary_remote_addr;
    ~^/another-url-to-rate-limit.html $binary_remote_addr;
}

Then within your location block, add:
limit_req zone=mylimit;

And that's it! Now only webpages matching the $request_uri will have rate limiting applied. This is handy when you have all of your request being routed through a single place, but you only want to have specific pages on your site rate limited.]]></summary>

These sorts of vulnerabilities have an impact on software supply chains; for example, if an attacker successfully commits code injection by deceiving human reviewers, future software is likely to inherit the vulnerability.
But let's look at the technique:
Extended strings: make sections of string literals seem as code, having the same impact as comments and causing string comparison to fail.


Comment out: forces a comment to appear as code, which is then ignored.


Early returns: bypass a function by running a return statement that seems to be inside a comment.




  
  
  What happens next?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I am back with another Linux article!😊
Today I will be going over basic commands you can use to monitor system performance! 📈📉💻
The 'top' command is used to display active processes and how much they are using system resources.

lsof stands for list of open files- basically shows you list of files and the processes

'tcpdump' is used to analyze network traffic
'htop' is a lot like top - It's just allows you to monitor system resources or processes. As you can see, it's a bit more fancy than top

'iostat' is a command that is used to monitor input/output devices, by telling you how long the devices have been active.

Displays the processes

Tells you how long the system has been up

'free' shows you the amount of available memory you have.

Used to monitor individual tasks. Great for troubleshooting issues.

'w' tells you information about users logged on and their processes

These commands can be vital for you to monitor your system, so I will be releasing a part 2 soon, as well!😆
For future Linux and security content, please give me a follow

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A well-known way is to use getaddrinfo() such like:
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <cerrno>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <netdb.h>
#include <string>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <sysexits.h>

int main(void)
{
    struct addrinfo hints;
    memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(struct addrinfo));
    hints.ai_family = AF_INET6;
    hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_DGRAM;
    hints.ai_protocol = IPPROTO_UDP;

    struct addrinfo* result_addrinfo = nullptr;
    auto result = getaddrinfo("fe80::dabb:c1ff:fe0a:17f2%enp39s0", std::to_string(12345).c_str(), &hints, &result_addrinfo);
    if( result != 0 ){
        std::cout << "`getaddrinfo()` failed: " << gai_strerror(errno) << std::endl;
        return result;
    }

    for(
        struct addrinfo* info = result_addrinfo;
        info != nullptr;
        info = info->ai_next
    ){
        char ipv6addr_human_readable_form[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN] = {0, };
        inet_ntop(info->ai_family, &((struct sockaddr_in6*)(info->ai_addr))->sin6_addr, ipv6addr_human_readable_form, info->ai_addrlen);
        auto ipv6_scope_id = ((struct sockaddr_in6*)(info->ai_addr))->sin6_scope_id;

        std::cout << "IPv6 address = " << ipv6addr_human_readable_form << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Scope-ID = " << std::to_string(ipv6_scope_id) << std::endl;
    }

    freeaddrinfo(result_addrinfo);
    return EX_OK;
}

Of course, the Scope-ID can also be obtained as previously. But is there an easier and shorter?
if_nametoindex()


Fortunately, Linux provides a function called if_nametoindex(). It returns the index number of the network interface, which is currently equal to the Scope-ID.
#include <net/if.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <sysexits.h>

int main(void)
{
    auto scope_id = if_nametoindex("enp39s0");
    std::cout << scope_id << std::endl;

    return EX_OK;
}

Now, the code became much shorter and easier. Also, there is no need to care to free memory!]]></summary>

Everything about this article was well done and very interesting.
There was one point in the article that spiked my interest: the author triggered the "creation" of the Form Controls dynamically within the Angular HTML.
So, I decided to experiment and see if I could use this as a means to trigger data validation and transformation.
This is an experiment, simple to see if I can do something. Personally, I see some benefit in the pattern. But, this does not mean I am endorsing this as a good pattern or a better means than any other way of doing something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever encountered ERROR: One or more PGP signatures could not be verified! this error during the installation of Dropbox in Arch based distro ? If yes then this guide is for you. 
Dropbox has their own PGP key because they upload it directly to the AUR that key is for linux@dropbox.com (if you don't know what PGP keys are it's basically a complex math formula that proves that this app is being uploaded and managed on the AUR by somebody at dropbox)
if you use a tool like yay or paru it can handle the functions of pacman and downloading stuff from the AUR and it's dead simple to use, I recommend paru because it's more modern and faster
To install paru run these commands
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git

cd paru

makepkg -si

After succesfully installing paru now it's time to install Dropbox. To do that first run
paru dropbox

Now you'll be prompt with a list of packages from AUR to choose from. You have to choose aur/dropbox which should be the first one... So press 1 and hit enter

If you want to review hit Y and enter

To close the review hit q on the the keyboard
Now you must prompt with installation confirmation. Hit Y and enter. You may need to enter your password for installation. 
After completion of you installation run dropbox on your terminal or search on the GUI

That's it!]]></summary>
