Using automatic processes to build it, less people, more services/machines
Having regular software security checks and reports
Having regular automatic vulnerability checks for every process
Having clear what is a vulnerability or not
Having a list of authoring and manufacturing authors, so we know exactly where that piece of software/hardware came from
Restricting, analyzing and controlling the use of third-party software and services
Reporting the vulnerabilities, describing exactly what they are and what are it's consequences
Knowing where all your product dependencies come from
Documenting everything, what OS did we use, the compiler, the IDE version, languages, packages versions, everything!
Automating everything
Using signed software
Being fast, solving the reported vulnerabilities as soon as we can, before they are exploited
In 2017, an exploit would take 2 days to be made public and used against us, now, it takes only 2 seconds
Re-thinking our trust levels
Being careful with the opensourse software we use, not using software isn't being maintained and can't provide regular updates and has security policies, dependencies lists and valid licenses
Writing clean code
Testing the dependencies
Throwing exceptions when we are supposed to
Writing clean and useful error messages
Having code reviews
Not making public, code that disables security checking, and not consuming software that has those embedded "features"
Not turning off the security features on the OS
Reading the documentation of what we want to use, before trying to use it
Take the above list in consideration and make it safer]]></summary>

Add to it the absence of a way to set when you want your local data to expire and you'll have all the ingredients that led me to create localit.
A simple example of how easy it is to use localit:
import { localit } from "localit";

localit.set("article", "localit 101", "3h");

console.log(localit.get("article"));
//  "localit 101"

localit's core methods are the same you would use while saving and retrieving data from localStorage.
set(), get() and remove()


These methods wrap and replace the logic behind setItem, getItem and removeItem(), removing the need to use JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse(), which I thin…]]></summary>

Almost two years ago I lost my iMac and it brought me an idea to see what's changed in the Linux world for 10 years. Starting from Ubuntu and Fedora I finally came to the elementary OS project's website. And it was quite astonishing. In comparison to the other distributions elementary had its view on how the operating system should view, how to make apps, its own design language and developers documentation. Thereby the decision to move to this OS was easy.
For now, it is almost two years since I moved from macOS to elementary OS as my daily driver. And, as I said earlier, I'm a developer. After looking for a native text editor I made myself think to make Norka. But, this article is about the distinct application.

sudo useradd <username>

komutu kullanılır.

Oluşturulan kullanıcıya şifre atamak için;
sudo passwd <username>

komutu kullanılır.

Tüm kullanıcıların görüntüleyebileceği dosyalar, çalıştırabileceği komutlar olduğu gibi sadece root yetkisine sahip kullanıcıların görüntüleyebileceği dosyalar ve çalıştırabileceği komutlar da vardır.
Oluşturduğumuz kullanıcıya, 

Bir kullanıcı root yetkisine sahip olduğunda istediği bütün işlemleri gerçekleştirebilir. Sistemi daha esnek ve güvenli kullanmak için root yetkisi verirken dikkatli olmalıyız. Root yetkisine sahip kullanıcıları;
cat /etc/sudoers

Bu dosyayı düzenlemek için ;
sudo visudo 

komutu kullanılır.

Komutu çalıştırıp, rootun bulunduğu kısmın altına,
<username> ALL=(ALL)    ALL

You can compare Python with other programming languages, but the readability of its code makes it easier for beginners to start their journey in coding. It also has a well-documented syntax that makes it easier for learners to understand the language.You can start learning python from Pythonscholar.com they explain each topic with multiple examples.
Python is one of the most popular programming languages that can be learnt by anyone. It is especially popular for scientific computing and data science due to its simplicity.
Python was created in 1991 by Guido von Rossum. It has an easy syntax with which you can write up to 100 lines of code without needing to use curly brackets {} at the end of each line.For more dept about python history you guys can refer this artical in what is python.
The environment for Python is cross-platform, so if you are working on Linux or Windows, you will find Python coding very similar to what you are used to. The downside is that it takes longer than other languages like C++ or Java, but once you learn it, Python will become your favorite language because it's flexible and able to solve many problems that many other languages cannot.

Python is a very powerful and popular programming language. It is used in websites, games, and even the International Space Station!
Python is easy to learn for beginners because it has a simple syntax and gets rid of the need for semicolons. Python also doesn't require any import statements when writing programs.]]></summary>

The least of them is the fact that you need to drop your laundry by yourself and pick it up yourself. Yes… There were some laundry services that would offer pick up and drop.

Have you ever experience difficulties in software development due to unsupported / different version ? Recently I was facing the same issue. The issue was a different Node.js version from my machine (Node v14.18.0) with my company project repository (Node v10 required). The first solution that instantly pop up in my mind was "I think downgrade my current node by uninstalling it will do the work", But what if you need another version for another project in the near future? Do you want to endure the pain of installing and uninstalling Node.js every time you need a different version of it ? 

NVM is a version manager for Node.js, it allows you to quickly install and use different versions of node via the command line.
Let's head to the tutorial !
If you happen to use UNIX, macOS, or WSL (Window Sub-system for Linux), you can install and read the official documentation here
If you happen to use Windows you can install it at NVM for windows which is developed by Corey Butler, download the nvm-setup.zip file.
 

After the installation you can open your command prompt and check whether nvm is recognized
C:\Users\YourUsername>nvm -v

Running version 1.1.8.

If nvm is not recognized as internal command or external command, try to re-open your command prompt.
Then, You can type nvm list in order to see list of Node.js version on your machine.
C:\Users\YourUsername>nvm list

  * 14.18.0 (Currently using 64-bit executable)
    10.18.0

If you don't see your desired Node.js version in the list, you can use nvm install command, for example if you want Node.js version 8, you can type nvm install 8.0.0
To use the installed Node.js version you can simply type nvm use 8.0.0
If you see an error message exit status 5: Access is denied., It is due to admin privilege issue. To solve it you can simply run your command prompt as administrator. 
Thank you for your time reading this short article / tutorial about Node Version Manager, hope it helps! and Have a great day.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Your terminal can do some really cool things. The | operator was a stroke of genius. It lets you take the output of one command and feed it to another, chaining together a few simple tools to perform a bigger automated task.
Shell scripts are a natural extension of your terminal's power. Creating ready-to-run recipes for later use? Sweet. But once you start using these scripts for more advanced things, you run into some unfortunate Bash quirks. For example: when a part of your script produces an error, the rest of the script will still be executed, making its behavior unpredictable.
There are some habits that you can adopt right now to make writing shell scripts easier.




Here's the gist of it if you don't need further explanation:
Add set -euo pipefail to improve how your script deals with undeclared variables and non-zero exit codes.
Add IFS=$'\n\t' so that array elements are split in a predictable way.
When defining functions, return data with echo instead of return. The return keyword doesn't do the same thing as in other languages.
Returning arrays from functions is not really possible. As a bad but easy workaround, you can pass array return values via a global variable.
Keep your whitespace in mind. Confusingly, if [ FOO=='bar' ] will overwrite the value of $FOO. if [ FOO = 'bar' ] will perform a string equality check.
Alternatively, for complex tasks, you'll probably have an easier time using a different scripting language like Python, Ruby or Perl.
Unofficial bash strict mode
Your bash scripts are rubbish, use another language]]></summary>

  WTF is everyone talking about???


If you're new to this whole full-stack development thing, and get confused by some of the words people use when talking about full-stack development, then stick around because in this 3 part series, I'll be compiling the most common words and phrases used when talking about full-stack development. Of corse, it will take much more time to learn the details of each of the things I'll be mentioning in these articles, these articles are just summarizers to give you an idea of these words and phrases so that you can understand what people are referencing with them when talking about certain areas of full-stack development.
1. Front-end
2. Back-end
3. Full-stack
4. DOM
5. API
6. Encryption
7. Decryption
8. HTTP
9. HTTPS
10. CI/CD
11. UI
12. UX
13. Serverless
cloudflare blog: Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. A serverless provider allows users to write and deploy code without the hassle of worrying about the underlying infrastructure. A company that gets backend services from a serverless vendor is charged based on their computation and do not have to reserve and pay for a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers, as the service is auto-scaling. Note that despite the name serverless, physical servers are still used but developers do not need to be aware of them.
14. Backend operations
15. Request/Response
16. Cache
17. Command-line
18. Virtual machine
19. AWS
20. Database
Stick around for Pt.2, the more advanced!

When developers within a team are working on a feature, they are often faced with the situation that each developer is trying to work on a certain aspect of the feature that requires a different version of the infrastructure than we’ve deployed via a Cloudformation(CF) stack, be it an ECS(Elastic Container Service) cluster with multiple task definitions, or when using any other service provided by AWS.
We at Capmo also ran into a similar situation within our teams. The challenge was not the multiple versions of our infrastructure being deployed: It was how were we going to manage the clean up of the Cloudformation stacks once their work is done. That’s when the idea of auto-deleting the CF stacks came up. After doing some research on our…]]></summary>

Think of it as a mix between Helm and Pulumi. It is a library that is used to generate Kubernetes YAML files with ease. Think like Helm but with actual code instead of templates. You have the power to generate anything you want while using any kind of input you want. Everything is evaluated at "build" time and the output is 100% static valid Kubernetes YAML. You also get to leverage the tooling built for Typescript (which is actually very good) while building and DEBUGGING your deployments. You can also publish "libraries" built with Kubernate to NPM and other Kubernate-based projects can use them as building blocks.
There is no programming model to speak of :) just write code and use it. In the end, the tool runs the code :) You can even skip this step and just build the Typescript into javascript and run it with Node. You can even make your own app on top of Kubernate to manage your deployments.
It is written in Typescript and it is very easy to use. It is also very easy to learn and understand. Everything is typed! Just follow the IntelliSense.

I've been wanting to try and create some sort of desktop with a window manager in JavaScript for a while now.
I finally took the opportunity to add a frontend to a script that wasn't supposed to become a web application.
The backend doesn't matter for this article, but in this case, it's an Express API that provides data about retro games.
I didn't want to code a projects with tons of direct dependencies. I only added MUI to test it (side projects are the perfect purpose to test new tools 🤤).
The desktop icons can be moved and will always remain below the windows.
Double clicking on an icon will open a window to display its content or will move to the top an already opened window.

We call him "Vinny", and every time I was writing something to help him the old latin phrase "veni, vidi, vici" ("I came, I saw, I conquered"). The last bit of that, "vici", is where I drew the name for the project. It means "I conquered," and I think that's pretty uplifting of a motto for a list of things that needs to get done.

If your application operates on data that your users naturally manage using a source control system like git, adding first-class git support to your APIs may be a good idea.
If you choose to add first-class git support to your own APIs, the fusebit/cloud-git project may come in handy. It provides a lightweight, pure JavaScript implementation of the git protocol that enables you to add git endpoints to your Node.js application.

Fusetunnel is great for working with browser testing tools like Browserling or external API callback services like Twilio, which require a public URL for callbacks.
Fusetunnel is Fusebit’s version of localtunnel.
The main difference with localtunnel (and other tunnels) is that Fusetunnel is end-to-end encrypted, giving the user greater security, promoting data protection, and preventing unauthorized access to data.

The P-10 risk, "Collection of data not required for the user-consented purpose" on the list is the collection of too much data from users.

GIMP is very useful, but sometimes doing not well. Or you find a way to capture screenshots via CLI, but the way using xwd command does not work.
In such a case, this article might be your friend.
This article provides you the way to capture screenshots using xwininfo and ImageMagick.
As previous, xwininfo and import of ImageMagick are required.
On Debian and Ubuntu, it needs to install x11-utils and imagemagick packages. To install these, run:
sudo apt install x11-utils imagemagick

Now, we are ready to do!
xwininfo.


To get "Window ID", run following command in a terminal:
xwininfo

Immediately prompts shown like following:

Select the window you want to capture by clicking a mouse. Then information of the selected window is displayed following the prompt.

The most important is the first line including "Window id: ...". So the hexadecimal is a Window ID. In the previous example, Window ID is 0x4000001!
import.


To capture a screenshot of the selected window using import command, it needs to pass "Window ID" with -window option.
Run:
import -window 0x4000001 screenshot.jpg

Finally, the screenshot is saved in the current directory!

I will show you "How to capture the whole desktop" by CLI. 
Passing root keyword to -window option:
import -window root screenshot_whole_desktop.jpg

Enjoy!]]></summary>

Linux で時刻同期といえば ntpd が有名ですが、最近は systemd のサービスである systemd-timesyncd が使われることが増えています。時刻同期を無効にしたい、けど手元の環境には ntpd が入っていないみたいだという場合はもしかしたら systemd-timesyncd が使われているのかもしれません。
この記事では systemd-timesyncd が使われているのかどうかを調べる方法と、systemd-timesyncd を無効化する方法、再度有効化する方法を解説します。
ターミナルで下記コマンドを実行します。
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd

systemd-timesyncd が使われている場合、下のスクリーンショットのようにコマンドの出力に "Active: active (running)" という文字列が確認できます。

一方で systemd-timesyncd が使用されていない場合は "Active: inactive (dead)" という文字列が確認できます。

無効化にはルート権限が必要です。
最初に動作中の systemd-timesyncd サービスを停止します。次のコマンドを実行します。
sudo systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd

次に systemd-timesyncd サービスを無効化します。次のコマンドを実行します。
sudo systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd

最後にサービスの状態を確認します。次のコマンドを実行します。
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd

"Active: active (running)" と表示されていた行が "Active: inactive (dead)" に変わっていれば無効化は完了です。OS 再起動の必要はありません。

再有効化にはルート権限が必要です。
最初に systemd-timesyncd サービスを有効化します。下記のコマンドを実行します。
sudo systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd

次にサービスを起動します。有効化しただけではサービスが起動していないからです。
sudo systemctl start systemd-timesyncd

最後にサービスの状態を確認します。下記コマンドを実行します。
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd

"Active: inactive (dead)" と表示されていた行が "Active: active (running)" に変わっていれば再有効化は完了です。OS 再起動の必要はありません。]]></summary>

Today, so many things depend on accurate time-keeping. Thus we don't need to disable time sync usually, but sometimes -- workaround to annoying GPSD bugs and so on -- we need to disable it.
In the past, it was common to use ntpd for time sync. Since systemd-216, the systemd-timesyncd is often used.
This article provides you "how to check systemd-timesyncd is being used", "how to disable systemd-timesyncd" and "how to re-enable systemd-timesyncd".
systemd-timesyncd is being used.


Run following command in a terminal.
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd

If systemd-timesyncd is being used for time synchronization, you can see "Active: active (running)" in the result like following screenshot.

On the other hand, systemd-timesyncd is not used, you can see "Active: inactive (dead)" in the result like following screenshot.

systemd-timesyncd.


At the first, you need to stop the service. To do this, run following command in a terminal.
sudo systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd

Then disable systemd-timesyncd, run following command in a terminal.
sudo systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd


First, set 'enable' for systemd-timesyncd. To do this, run:
sudo systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd

Then start the service of systemd-timesyncd. To do this, run:
sudo systemctl start systemd-timesyncd

Finally, let's see systemd-timesyncd is really enabled. Run:
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd

For Primitive value the value is store on the stack, in other word, in the current context!
For Reference value the value is store in the heap, it's a big storage that keep all objects and each object has it's own adress! (Like house in a village, each house has its own adress)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve ever faced such temptation to wrap inner exceptions within some neatly-defined exception type, you’d better off fight the devil. Let exceptions be themselves and freely fly high the call stack. 💸
To elaborate on the issue, consider the hypothetical DataProcessor and the general purpose exception type DataProcessingFailure below:
class DataProcessingFailure extends Error {
  constructor(public innerError: Error) {
    super();
  }
}

class DataProcessor {
  process() {
    try {
      // Some processing
    } catch (err) {
      throw new DataProcessingFailure(err)
    }
  }
} 

Here, the process() method only raises a DataProcessingFailure exception, if any. Whatever exception occurs (e.g., DivisionByZero) the caller of process() just catches a DataProcessingFailure instance. So, DataProcessingFailure is a wrapper exception.
The reason behind advising against wrapper exceptions is the change of behavior that you exert on the downstream system seen by higher level controllers. For instance, you could mask a well-defined exception that itself is an intricate part of the domain model. Another example is when your wrapper could mask network related exceptions, most of which resolve just by retrying, albeit if some caller at higher level of call stack could catch them as they are.
Putting it all together, you’d logically prefer minimizing footprints/side-effects of various components/implementations on each other, so that you could avoid unwanted couplings/special-treatments.

I’ve decided to record my daily encounters with professional issues on a somewhat regular basis. Not all of them are equally important/unique/intricate, but are indeed practical, real, and of course, textually minimal.]]></summary>

Then we installed Virtual machine VMware. Then on the Vmware we installed the downloaded Windows operating system.
Now in order to make communication between host(Ubuntu) and virtual machine(Windows) we need to make configurations and networking on Vmware.You need to enable VNC connections as shown below.
 
In this guide we walk you through the MSSQL Server installation in Windows on VMware.

We will now install Postgres in our Ubuntu. To install this follow the installation steps here.
For Postgres configuration steps: 
     psql --version





  

  It is advisable to check if the Postgres is running using this command before you proceed
     sudo systemctl status postgresql





  

  Connection To PostgreSQL running.
     sudo -u postgres psql

Git is the world's most popular distributed version control system used by many open-source and commercial projects. It allows you to collaborate on projects with your fellow developers, keep track of your code changes, revert to previous stages, create branches, and more. Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) developed Git.
A version control system is a system that keeps a record of the changes in a file (or multiple files) over a period. This is so that a user may return to a previous version of the system's software whenever necessary. This article shows you how to install and configure Git in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
In this article, you will learn how to install and configure Git on Ubuntu 20.04 via the Command line.
The operating system running Ubuntu 20.04 Linux
A root or non-root user with Sudo privileges
Has stable internet connection
Terminal window / Command line
Update all system packages to the latest, Run the following command:
sudo apt-get upadate
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

The Git utility package is available in ubuntu software sources, which can be installed by APT-GET. Run the following command:
sudo apt-get install git

Verify the installation, run the following command:
git --version

That’s it, you have successfully installed Git on your Ubuntu, and you can start using it.
Set your global user name and email. Run the following command:
git config --global user.name "<YOUR NAME>"
git config --global user.email "<YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>"

Looking for a serverless hosting service is a big pain when you just want to taste or even host a small project on it. Today, I found a new resource which lets you create serverless functions for absolutely free! Vercel. So, lets build & deploy our first Serverless function on it!
The platform requires us to install its CLI in order to develop & deploy our functions. Lets do npm i -g vercel to install the CLI globally. After creating a new directory, we'll initialize it as a new node project.

Vercel cli expects us to put all of our .js files in a folder called /api.
.js files will contain 1 default exported function which represents a REST API endpoint taking 2 parameters request & response representing the express's Request & Response objects respectively (just like in normal express.js GET/POST endpoints).
/api/{name-of-file}
So I have created a basic node.js project with following files:



"But how I will develop them without even testing?"
The vercel cli which we just just installed globally provides a functionality to run the functions on our own local machines.
You will be required by the CLI to login/signup into a vercel account, join me from here after completing that ;)
vercel dev. For the first time running the cli, it requires us to do some quick configs & settings, after completing that you should see something like this:

To check how the functions are working locally, we have to go to http://localhost:3000/api & to access the endpoint in hello.js, we will go to http://localhost:3000/api/hello


Everything looks awesome! lets deploy it on vercel!
Vercel's CLI makes deploying functions as easy as running a command on the terminal, we'll now run vercel on our terminal in the root of the directory.

HERE YOU GO!

APIs are becoming crucial to modern app development. Therefore making sure that the data you pass between your APIs is secure and not compromised is a priority.
Unfortunately, APIs face a number of threats such as SQL injection, Cross-site scripting (XSS), Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), Man-in-the-middle (MitM), and Credential stuffing.
The best way to avoid these attacks and improve your API security is to follow some simple best practices.
Prioritize security
Encrypt your data
Share as little as possible
Authentication
Limit the number of messages
Data validation
API firewalling

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s say that you’re building a mono-repo app. The structure is dividing some services like fronted, backend and docs. This application and the structure can be handled by Lerna — a tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages. What Lerna does (as a part of many features) is the ability to resolve local and global package.json files to use one and correct packages list and representation of dependencies. This means that you can use global packages in all of your services but if you use some package in the frontend app you don’t need to install it for the backend one. And with the Lerna boostrap feature, you can install and manage dependencies for all of your services with one command and process.
OK, take a look at the repo structure.

The steps are simple. Hook into your express app, do not allow ws to create its own server, pick a path. Handle the "upgrade" event that is the protocol negotiating to go beyond simple HTTP.
import express from "express"
import cookieParser from "cookie-parser"
import * as WebSocket from 'ws';

const app = express()
app.use(express.json())
app.use(cookieParser())

// all your normal routes
app.post("/refresh-token", issueRefreshToken)
app.post("/delete-token", deleteRefreshToken)

// and now the magic
const websocketServer = new WebSocket.Server({
  noServer: true,
  path: "/echo"
})
server.on("upgrade", (request, socket, head) => {
  websocketServer.handleUpgrade(request, socket, head, (websocket) => {
    websocketServer.emit("connection", websocket, request)
  })
})

websocketServer.on('connection', (ws: WebSocket) => {

  //connection is up, let's add a simple simple event
  ws.on('message', (message: string) => {
    websocketServer.clients.forEach((client) => {
      client.send(`${message}`)
    })

    //log the received message and send it back to the client
    console.log('received: %s', message);
    ws.send(`Hello, you sent -> ${message}`);
  });

  ws.send('Hi there, I am a WebSocket server');
});


This creates an echo server that broadcasts whatever it receives to each connected client.
To test this, wscat works well.
yarn global add wscat

Then do this in two separate terminals:
wscat -c 'ws://localhost/echo'

Type in one, and you should immediately see it in the other.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[console.log is useful in a lot of situations (although there are usually better ways to debug if that's what you're doing).
In the browser console.log works well with objects, you can drill down as much as you need. But in Node.js, when you look at the output of a nested object, you'll often see this:
$ console.log({a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}})

{ a: { b: { c: [Object] } } }

d: {} was replaced with [Object]. But why?
It's because the command line / terminal doesn't have a nice UI for drilling down, so Node attempts to print up to three levels deep. Beyond three levels it just prints [Object].
This is controlled by a variable in the node 'util' module, called depth, which defaults to 2. You can set it yourself here:
require('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = 0; // top level only, e.g.:
// { a: [Object] }
require('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = null; // print everything, e.g.: 
// {
//  a: { b: { c: { d: {} } } }
// }

It's not a great idea to change an underlying variable, as it might come back to bite later. So a cleaner way is to convert the JSON object to a string and log that. We can use node's built in JSON class and the stringify method:
complexObject = {a: {b: { c: {d: {}}}}}
console.log(JSON.stringify(complexObject, null, 2))

// {
//   "a": {
//     "b": {
//       "c": {
//         "d": {}
//       }
//     }
//   }
// }

Note that the 3rd parameter of JSON.stringify, Number 2, controls the number of spaces of indentation, and the 2nd parameter can be used to filter or adjust the objects and properties shown.
Now you can really see what's in those deep Objects.]]></summary>

October is National Cyber Security Awareness Month. On top of that, OWASP just celebrated its 20th anniversary. To celebrate, we’re going to run through the newly updated OWASP TOP 10 to remind everyone of how you can better protect your applications, your businesses, and your customers from unlawful and damaging cyber attacks. We’ll also be highlighting where the updates were made and why and throw in some tips on how strengthening your identity solution can help mitigate these threats.
The new Top 10 is still a working draft, and OWASP is soliciting feedback on errors and corrections.
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organization that was set up to help raise awareness around web application security and provides guidance on how to incorporate preventative measures into your applications, infrastructure, and internal processes.  
They have several projects, including an insecure JavaScript application used for security training, but the one that we’re focusing on today is the newly updated 2021 edition of their list of the top 10 threats to web app security.  
Updated regularly, the OWASP Top 10 lists the main security threats that affect web applications today. Each entry enumerates the threat, shows possible attack vectors, and highlights preventive measures to reduce the risk of such threat. At Auth0, we take steps to mitigate most of the issues outlined below, so when you delegate your authentication needs to us, a lot of this is already taken care of for you.
Let’s run through the list, looking at the threats and what we could be doing to make sure our own applications are secure and examining some features of the Auth0 platform that help to mitigate or entirely remove such threats.
For a high-level overview of the list updates, please refer to this handy chart, provided by OWASP:
